7250013 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7250014 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

7250058 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7250059 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7250060 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7250061 das multilaterale system befindet sich zur zeit in einer krise die auseinandersetzungen zwischen russland und der nato sind ein zeichen f r diese probleme und ein zeichen daf r dass die internationale zusammenarbeit sich momentan sehr schwierig gestaltet auch die stationierung amerikanischer raketen in polen und die reaktion russlands das nun seine raketen in der n he der grenze zur eu stationieren will tragen zu den spannungen bei wenn man diesen weg weitergeht wird man daf r einen hohen preis bezahlen m ssen den mangel an kommunikation und gegenseitigem austausch

7250063 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7250064 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7250065 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7250066 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

7250073 not at all i think that you and i get on very well together and getting a divorce is quite simple these days
7250074 of course i love you and cant think of anything else most of the time and when you make love to me it shatters me every time with pat it never happened even once not once in eighteen years

7250079 aircraft flying over our air space are monitored seven days a week 24 hours a day much of the identifying process is done by hand flight plans from the federal aviation administration faa are compiled in logs and have to be manually searched to identify aircraft unlike current operating procedures the new system will mean fewer manual inquiries and phone contact with faa officials about commercial aircraft the faa flight plan is now hooked up via computer with the new r saocs so operators can easily track friendly aircraft through our air space without having to get someone on the phone or thumb through written log books of flight plans

7250129 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7250130 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7250131 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7250132 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7250133 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7250134 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7250135 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7250136 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7250137 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely

7250167 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations

7250169 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7250170 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7250171 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7250172 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7250173 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7250174 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7250175 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7250176 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7250177 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7250178 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7250179 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7250180 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7250181 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7250182 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7250183 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7250184 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7250185 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7250186 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7250187 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7250188 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7250189 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7250190 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7250191 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7250192 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7250193 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7250194 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7250195 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7250196 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7250197 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7250198 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7250199 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7250200 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7250201 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7250202 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7250203 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7250204 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7250205 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7250206 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7250207 this is a planning took where all things are going
7250208 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7250209 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7250210 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7250211 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7250212 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7250213 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7250214 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7250215 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7250216 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7250217 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7250218 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7250219 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7250220 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7250221 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7250222 the colossal species has a reputation for being an aggressive and dangerous predator and have been feared and misrepresented in the past
7250223 my research suggests theyre not the t rex of the sea they get more docile as they mature a strange phenomenon that has caught scientists off guard
7250224 we are looking at something verging on the incredibly bizarre as she got older she got shorter and broader and was reduced to a giant gelatinous blob carrying many thousands of eggs
7250225 her shape was likely to have affected her behaviour and ability to hunt
7250226 its likely she was just blobbing around the seabed carrying her brood of eggs living on dead fish while her mate was off hunting
7250227 people dont usually think about these types of cells when they talk about human embryonic stem cell therapy but it is important
7250228 theres more infections all the time and the number of donors is more and more limited
7250229 symbels should not be included in your text they are here to prevent social text from representing them as commands instead of instructions to you
7250230 our fans need to jump all over this kid as soon as he steps on the field this is a huge advantage for us and unless this kid plays out of his mind we should be able to put this one in the books unless we screw our selfs over get this kid rattled in the first quarter and who knows what the rest of the game is going to be like if he throws a pick on the first pass he throws its game on
7250231 the bank sincerely regrets this situation and apologizes to its customers for any inconvenience and concern this has caused
7250232 this is the first time this has ever happened to me in 44 years of banking
7250233 i heard a terrific sound it turned out to be a torpedo
7250234 i saw some of the toughest guys in the navy were scared i figured when they were scared there was something to be scared about
7250235 youre no german he said then he said in english that we didnt have to paddle the admiralty had been notified and two destroyers would pick us up
7250236 he took me by the hand and led me to the social security office
7250237 then he said whatever you do watch out for chicago girls
7250238 fedexs legal position is much less appealing because these drivers are at the core of their business
7250239 weve given that entrepreneurial opportunity to thousands of contractors to own grow and expand their own business
7250240 the department of human services gives me 50 a month in food stamps to feed two people
7250241 we fed 12 people friday 22 people thursday 29 on wednesday
7250242 our food bank had served 15 people a month we did that number in the last two weeks
7250243 there has always been a problem with poverty but there has been a change of people
7250244 now its not just the homeless not just the former inmates its touching families in which both parents have to work to get by now with everything going sky high in prices they need help
7250245 right now a gallon of milk costs more than a gallon of gas
7250246 and even at discount stores there is no more 25 cent bread
7250247 i couldnt believe how the price of fruit went up in the past two weeks
7250248 i go out every three days to look for work
7250249 the challenge is that they need skills that i dont have i can do factory work i can take care of kids i can do a little bit of nurses aide work in a nursing facility
7250250 i can still work theres just so much they can count as income
7250251 i volunteered for a year as a library assistant at grant foreman putting library books on the shelves
7250252 it depends more on how they are taught at home whether its going to affect them positively or negatively
7250253 if the parents are working to make ends meet they probably have less time to spend with their child
7250254 so i see the situation at both ends of the city
7250255 if the children are starving were going to feed them
7250256 if they need clothes were going to get them clothes theres not a year that goes by that we dont have to find clothing for them some of the kids who come to school dont even have electricity at home
7250257 but we always have more well to do parents always asking what supplies they can give to the school
7250258 the exchange club helps us and the wedding ring class at st pauls united methodist church takes five or six kids out and buys a wardrobe we work as a community to get kids what they need
7250259 mostly i just wanted to thank him for taking a stand for peace
7250260 were followers of him who share his passion and compassion
7250261 i think hes a great man because of his unflinching love of people in any circumstance and his undying love for the poor and the left out
7250262 i dont agree with anyone who breaks the law in any way
7250263 as far as what the father is doing regarding the school of the americas i disagree with him
7250264 its turned out some great soldiers and great leaders for central and south america
7250265 the ones at bangor i just dont believe in i think we need a nuclear deterrent
7250266 very humble example of how jesus wants you to live your life
7250267 anybody that chains himself to the doors of the federal courthouse has a lot of guts
7250268 hes just not afraid civil disobedience is about breaking unjust laws
7250269 i never get the sense that i am a lawbreaker or that i am a criminal
7250270 i believe the possession of nuclear weapons is incompatible with the non violence of jesus
7250271 my mother was feeding people on the back porch during the depression
7250272 i had a harder time forgiving myself i felt like i was leading a double life
7250273 i knew by crossing over there that would be the direction i was going in
7250274 you need someone who gets you doing those things you thought you would never do
7250275 i tell people in 80 years i moved a mile
7250276 im more concerned about it here on earth than i am for it in heaven
7250277 its probably the only chance ill ever get to see these guys again
7250278 i had never heard anything like it it was so exciting
7250279 went backwards and started listening to these jamaican records they were covering
7250280 when you know what you love it makes it a lot easier
7250281 its kind of like having your parents visit if your parents had 37 number ones hits in jamaica
7250282 hes bearing most of the weight of the process himself
7250283 a music documentary with bad sound is like a car with no tires
7250284 mar salgado quanto do teu sal s o l grimas de portugal por te cruzarmos quantas m es choraram quantos filhos em v o rezaram quantas noivas ficaram por casar para que fosses nosso mar valeu a pena tudo vale a pena se a alma n o pequena quem quere passar al m do bojador tem que passar al m da dor deus ao mar o perigo e o abismo deu mas nele que espelhou o c u
7250285 i could probably sit around the pool or play golf and for a while i didnt do much of anything but ive gotten an awful lot from my country and its time to give something back
7250286 best not to go home and sit down and die
7250287 shes been putting the finishing touches to some of the dance routines today in a good way shes a perfectionist
7250288 mel and stephen wanted a lavish do to celebrate their relationship
7250289 they agreed to allow the event to be covered by a magazine but are obliged to fulfil certain requirements
7250290 one of these is a certain quota of well known faces family and close friends simply wont do
7250291 i decided i need to find my new british bff
7250292 london watch out im coming to town and bringing my fast paced life with me
7250293 im in the uk all the time but of course i cant bring all my friends so ive decided to look for a new bff across the pond
7250294 i need a best friend who is hot who can keep up with me and most of all who is real and wont be a backstabber im not leaving london until i find that amazing girl or guy who can meet the challenges
7250295 this year one of my goals is not to stress just kind of let life come as it is
7250296 im going to try and do that a little more just take things step by step instead of always having a plan
7250297 everyone wants me to fight k fed because hes a notorious celebrity dad and so am i its for charity
7250298 its serious boxing you have to go get a trainer i have to register with the mature boxing association
7250299 i dont care who it is its for charity ive been beaten up by the press so i dont care if i get a few shots by a kid half my age

7250305 os bancos adotaram uma pol tica mais conservadora de provisionamento
7250306 assim o dinheiro reservado para essa provis o subtra do do balan o isso pode ter alguma influ ncia sobre o resultado
7250307 os privados por serem companhias abertas t m uma responsabilidade uma aten o a mais nesse ponto por serem mais fortemente monitoradas
7250308 al m disso com a economia tendendo a desacelerar daqui para a frente isso pode implicar em mais inadimpl ncia o que tamb m d peso para um provisionamento maior
7250309 o bb investiu muito em modelos de gest o e qualidade de atendimento ele recebeu um aporte de capital forte passou por reestrutura o profissionalizou muito a gest o e tem cobran a por resultados do ponto de vista da competi o ele est no mesmo patamar dos grandes privados

7250321 un euro plus faible et une stabilisation des prix des mati res premi res ne seront sans doute pas suffisants pour compenser le recul attendu de la demande interne et nous pensons donc que la france est entr e dans une p riode de tr s faible croissance qui pourrait entra ner une remont e du ch mage

7250359 its an incredible decision for a linesman who is in line with the play to actually give an offside on that one

7250362 it doesnt happen all the time and its clear it doesnt happen all the time
7250363 we got a bad one at tannadice earlier this season which has been forgotten about maybe because we dont make that much of a fuss about it same situation here

7250398 much respect to spain but the us is back on top again
7250399 jika kamu mau berpuasalah dan jika kamu mau maka berbukalah
7250400 dahulu kami pernah bersafar bersama rosululloh shollallohu alaihi wa sallam orang yang berpuasa tidak mencela orang yang berbuka dan orang yang berbuka juga tidak mencela orang yang berpuasa
7250401 kami pernah bepergian bersama rosululloh shollallohu alaihi wa sallam pada bulan romadhon dalam keadaan udara yang sangat panas sampai sampai salah seorang diantara kami meletakkan tangannya di atas kepalanya karena panas yang sangat menyengat di antara kami tidak ada yang berpuasa kecuali rosululloh shollallohu alaihi wa sallam dan abdulloh bin rowahah
7250402 ambillah rukhshoh dari alloh yang telah dianugerahkan nya kepada kalian
7250403 pada hari ini orang orang yang berbuka berangkat dengan mendapatkan ganjaran pahala
7250404 dahulu aku memiliki hutang puasa romadhon akan tetapi aku tidak bisa mengqodhonya kecuali di bulan syaban
7250405 barangsiapa yang meninggal dan punya hutang puasa maka walinya yang membayar puasanya
7250406 wahai rosululloh sesungguhnya ibuku telah meninggal dan dia memiliki hutang puasa sebulan apakah aku harus mengqodho puasa itu baginya
7250407 kalau begitu maka hutang kepada alloh lebih berhak untuk ditunaikan
7250408 wahai rosululloh sesungguhnya ibuku telah meninggal dan dia memiliki hutang puasa nadzar apakah saya harus berpuasa menggantikannya
7250409 bagaimana menurutmu seandainya ibumu memiliki hutang kemudian kamu membayarkannya apakah hal itu bisa menunaikan hutangnya
7250410 sesungguhnya keadaanku tidak sebagaimana kalian aku diberi makan dan diberi minum
7250411 barangsiapa di antara kalian ingin wishol maka hendaklah dia wishol tidak berbuka sampai waktu sahur
7250412 sungguh telah ada teladan yang baik bagimu pada diri rosululloh
7250413 demi alloh sungguh aku akan berpuasa sepanjang siang dan dan sholat malam sepanjang hidupku
7250414 benar ayah dan ibuku sebagai tebusannya aku memang benar benar telah mengatakannya
7250415 sesungguhnya kamu tidak akan sanggup melaksanakannya maka berpuasa dan juga berbukalah tidur dan sholat malamlah dan berpuasalah 3 hari di setiap bulan karena satu kebaikan itu dilipatkan pahalanya senilai 10 kebaikan dan itu sudah seperti puasa sepanjang masa puasa dahr
7250416 kalau begitu maka puasalah sehari dan tidak puasa 2 hari
7250417 kalau begitu maka puasalah sehari dan tidak berpuasa sehari itulah puasa nabi dawud alaihis salam dan itu merupakan puasa yang paling utama
7250418 tidak ada puasa yang boleh dikerjakan melebihi puasa saudaraku dawud alaihis salam selama separoh masa maka berpuasalah sehari dan tidak berpuasa sehari
7250419 sesungguhnya puasa yang paling dicintai alloh adalah puasa dawud dan sholat yang paling dicintai alloh adalah sholatnya dawud beliau itu tidur setengah malam dan bangun di sepertiga sesudahnya lalu tidur seperenam malam sisanya dan beliau senantiasa berpuasa sehari dan tidak berpuasa sehari
7250420 kekasihku shollallohu alaihi wa sallam mewasiatkan kepadaku dengan tiga perkara puasa 3 hari setiap bulan sholat 2 rokaat dhuha dan sholat witir sebelum tidur
7250421 aku pernah bertanya kepada jabir bin abdillah apakah nabi shollallohu alihi wa sallam melarang puasa di hari jumat
7250422 janganlah salah seorang di antara kalian berpuasa di hari jumat kecuali sehari sebelum atau sesudahnya berpuasa
7250423 aku pernah menghadiri hari raya bersama umar bin khoththob rodhiyallohu anhu dan beliau berkata dalam khotbahnya dua hari raya ini dilarang oleh rosululloh shollallohu alaihi wa sallam untuk mengerjakan puasa yaitu hari kalian ber idul fithri dan hari kalian menyembelih kurban
7250424 barangsiapa berpuasa sehari ketika berjihad di jalan alloh niscaya alloh akan menjeuhkan wajahnya dari apai neraka sejauh perjalanan 70 tahun

7250517 allahs hatred for the people of misguidance when faith is presented to them in this world and they turn away from it and refuse to accept it is greater than their hatred for themselves when they see the punishment of allah with their own eyes on the day of resurrection
7250518 whomever allah sends astray will have no other guide except him
7250519 our lord you have caused us to die twice two deaths and you have given us life twice
7250520 for they were lifeless drops of semen then they were given life then made to die then brought back to life for the resurrection
7250521 will ye slay a man because he says my lord is allah
7250522 allah never sends a messenger to a people and they kill him or some of the believers who call them to the truth then that generation passes away but he then sends them someone who will support their call and will seek vengeance for their blood from those who did that to them in this world so the prophets and believers may be killed in this world but their call will prevail in this world
7250523 allah granted victory to his prophet muhammad and his companions over those who had opposed him disbelieved in him and shown hostility towards him he caused his word and his religion to prevail over all other religions this religion will continue to prevail until the hour begins

7250532 i never came to be worshipped not the first time and not this time i came to be emulated
7250533 i become aware of my racial identity on my first day of school on my first day of kindergarten
7250534 a group of sixth grades tied me to a tree spray painted the word nigger on me and threw rocks at me that was my first day of school and the teachers really didnt do much of anything i used to live across the street from school and kind of down the way a little bit the teachers said okay just go home so i had to out run all these kids going home which i was able to do it was certainly on eye opening experience you know being five years old we were the only minority family in all of cypress california
7250535 people get this stereotype that racism is in the south thats b s its everywhere
7250536 it is a touchy situation we need to have some honest dialogue about it within our own culture
7250537 i think it is an unusual case but i think youll see more and more of these cases as time go on

7250541 weve agreed with portsmouth that linvoy primus will come here

7250543 i have only one aim to take to great heights together with my team mates il toro and all their splendid fans
7250544 descendents of the survivors of the matrilineal based negro chattel slavery system as found on the continental united states during the antebellum period
7250545 heavily influenced by those ideas and opinions that many african americans hold and learned from childhood
7250546 dont believe the hype fighting cultural misinformation about african americans
7250547 the situation is happening more frequently it happens more on the unorganized corners than in day labor centers but the problem itself is widespread its like a well known secret that everyone knows and has experienced but no one talks about
7250548 gringos see us as cheap brothels and not as day labor centers many enter into it knowingly but the majority of us are tricked into it they tell us its a job and later it turns out they want sex i have co workers who have even been drugged without realizing it
7250549 they shouted insults at me you could tell they liked humiliating me they had knives on the table and it really scared me especially the white guy who pointed a syringe at me supposedly filled with drugs i dont know how i did it i didnt stop talking and when i could i got closer to the door until i could open it and run away
7250550 they bring men to this apartment one after another and it always sounds like things are being knocked around
7250551 they play for the other team they are gay they keep coming here in different cars but we know their faces and its best not to get too close
7250552 we are doing an investigation about people who hire workers for sex acts what do you think about that
7250553 i was offered a job on a ranch together with three other workers from the corner when we arrived there they had us clean the stables and then they gave us lunch a while later i felt everything start spinning some of them started to grope us but i couldnt even throw a punch everything was blurry when i woke up they had thrown me in a vacant lot and i didnt know where i was i think they f raped me and what do i get out of suing them if in this country the law always sides with what the boss says
7250554 weve investigated the incidents and we have found a lot of cases but because of fear and shame the day laborer will not present the charges formally before a judge there is not one case like this in the courts these immigrants are afraid that theyll be accused of being gay on their work corners or that theyll be deported and its very difficult to change that mentality they cant see that what happened to them is a crime
7250555 we dont know how much this situation has grown but were sure that the numbers of people who prostitute themselves are greater and the problem is growing
7250556 they charge 100 120 a night a lot accept it or name their price some employers already have their favorites and they come looking for them those of us who dont do it know their cars and we dont approach them for us the danger isnt them its the perverts who hire us and then trick us when you open the car door you never know what risks await you
7250557 the people who are doing the drudgery are as a rule in their proper places
7250558 while the rest of america tries to go about its business
7250559 economic and cultural theories have failed to explain most of the pattern
7250560 how could such huge gains be intelligence gains either the children of today were far brighter than their parents or at least in some circumstances i q tests were not good measures of intelligence
7250561 if the everyday world is your cognitive home it is not natural to detach abstractions and logic and the hypothetical from their concrete referents
7250562 did their genes begin to mutate somewhere in the 1930s
7250563 or is it possible that somewhere in the 1920s if not earlier the sociocultural history of italo americans took a turn from the blacks and the spanish americans which permitted their assimilation into the general undifferentiated mass of americans
7250564 whatever it was that was going through my mind when we drove past the water tower fifty miles back
7250565 as far as i can determine no clinical or school psychologists using the wisc over the relevant 25 years noticed that its criterion of mental retardation became more lenient over time
7250566 yet no one drew the obvious moral about psychologists in the field they simply were not making any systematic assessment of the i q criterion for mental retardation
7250567 chinese americans are an ethnic group for whom high achievement preceded high i q rather than the reverse
7250568 it is not easy to view the history of their achievements without emotion
7250569 by the nineteen seventies you had gotten most of the juice out of the environment that you were going to get
7250570 starting in the nineteen seventies to put it very crudely you had a higher proportion of black kids being born to really dumb mothers
7250571 kids who want to be above average dont have to aim as high
7250572 the mind is much more like a muscle than weve ever realized
7250573 it needs to get cognitive exercise its not some piece of clay on which you put an indelible mark
7250574 black americans are a competing racial group and why should a competing racial group help a multiracial group mixed race progress and get recognition

7250646 las medallas reflejan que el deporte espa ol ha progresado
7250647 pek n se lo ha puesto muy dif cil a todos los que vengan detr s pero intentaremos superarlo en madrid 2016
7250648 el esp ritu que ha tenido el equipo y el apoyo que se han dado todos los deportistas
7250649 el n mero de medallas con dos oros m s que en atenas quiere decir que el deporte espa ol ha progresado no es comparable el n mero de medallas ganadas en atenas a las logradas en pek n por la espectacular actuaci n que ha tenido china que ha hecho desplazarse a otros pa ses en el medallero
7250650 ha ganado una medalla por el esp ritu de equipo que ha tenido y por el apoyo que se han dado todos los deportistas como dijo rafa nadal
7250651 en deportes de equipo se han ganado dos platas y un bronce y hay que destacar el resultado del waterpolo el baloncesto femenino y el hockey femenino tanto a nivel individual como colectivo han tenido una actuaci n espectacular que tiene un valor incalculable
7250652 todas las medallas son iguales y todos deben tener el mismo reconocimiento
7250653 todo el mundo tiene derecho un d a a no ganar y llorar por quedarte en plata como la selecci n de hockey es un gesto de un gran campe n pero es en el momento una vez que te enfr as debes estar contento nadie puede estar descontento con una plata
7250654 son seis porque nos han quitado uno que es de iker mart nez y xabi fern ndez aunque respetemos las decisiones
7250655 lo mejor ha sido todo el equipo y lo peor el dopaje de maribel moreno sin duda que ha engrandecido a los dem s no ha manchado al equipo pero ha hecho da o porque el deporte espa ol no puede estar en entredicho por esto
7250656 todos los deportes hacen una reflexi n despu s de los juegos pero porque no hayan tenido medalla no podemos pensar que no han tenido una buena planificaci n el deporte no es una ciencia exacta por no sacar medallas no hay que pensar que haya que hacer grandes cambios hay que buscar los fallos para mejorar pero con tranquilidad
7250657 si no llega a ser por los rbitros en vez de plata tendr amos oro
7250658 mi ltimo partido con espa a espero que no llevamos mucha carga y el cuerpo nota ciertos excesos que tengo que controlar por mi bien y el de mis equipos tengo 28 a os y me queda mucha gasolina yo siempre quiero volver y dar el m ximo para conseguir todos los retos que nos planteemos con esta selecci n
7250659 tuvimos opciones todo el partido estoy orgulloso del trabajo de este equipo esto dice mucho de nosotros y de que merec amos estar en la situaci n en la que est bamos el dream team para m s lo existe un dream team el de barcelona que fue un equipo nico aunque otros han estado muy cerca de aqu l es incomparable
7250660 la mentalidad no tuvo nada que ver con el partido de la fase de frupos en ning n momento nos hemos visto derrotados en el otro partido falt chispa confianza y salimos derrotados de antemano porque ya hab amos logrado la clasificaci n
7250661 aunque perdimos nos vamos con buenas sensaciones y con la impresi n de que este equipo puede ganar a cualquiera han conseguido el oro lo merecen pero para ello han tenido que luchar mucho eeuu tiene mucho talento y t cnicamente es muy bueno
7250662 nos acercamos mucho pero estados unidos tiene a un jugador como kobe bryant y volvimos a la realidad pero tuvimos opciones de vencer no creo que fuera el mejor partido cada uno es una batalla distinta aunque s el mejor de estos juegos estamos contentos con la medalla de plata
7250663 creo que hemos merecido ganar la medalla de oro porque hemos hecho un trabajo incre ble si no llega a ser por los rbitros en vez de la medalla de plata tendr amos la de oro
7250664 si les pitan los pasos que hacen la defensa con manos que hacen y pitan todo est claro que hubi semos podido ganar perfectamente hemos estado a tres puntos a pesar de los rbitros y si hubiesen estado bien seguro que hubi semos ganado pero claramente
7250665 si los rbitros hubiesen aplicado las reglas fiba hubi semos ganado pero estamos muy satisfechos por haber ganado la plata
7250666 ellos han tenido que dar m s del cien por cien cerca del 200 por cien porque si no no ganan
7250667 hemos demostrado que somos mejores si el arbitraje hubiera sido con las reglas fiba habr amos ganado
7250668 se les ha visto un poco m s nerviosos que en otros partidos todo el que haya seguido un poco a este equipo lo ha podido ver estaban todos de pie hablando un poquito nerviosos s que han estado
7250669 estamos muy contentos pero un poco cabreados nos hemos quedado a las puertas y cuando est bamos m s cerca no ha podido ser
7250670 hemos llegado a donde quer amos hemos perdido contra un equipo muy bueno creo que hemos dado la cara todo el mundo lo ha visto y eso es lo importante
7250671 ayudando a sus compa eros gritando apoyando y la verdad es que ha sido espectacular ha sido un mes muy especial jugar as contra el que todos dec an que era el favorito y lograra una plata en unos jjoo es apasionante
7250672 ha sido un gesto muy bonito mi situaci n es diferente a la de pau porque yo puedo estar saltando con mi equipaci n y estar jugando en un par de d as
7250673 ha sido muy especial hab a hablado mucho con pau pens bamos que un lesionado nos podr a dar buenas suerte como la otra vez y hemos llegado bastante lejos
7250674 estamos en el mejor momento con gente joven hay que seguir trabajando y para delante y conseguir muchas m s cosas
7250675 esto es bueno para el baloncesto de todo el mundo
7250676 esto es bueno para el baloncesto espa ol y de todo el mundo
7250677 ha sido un partido muy espectacular estados unidos es un equipo con mucha fuerza y f sicamente es un portento y nosotros a base de talento y ganas de ganar nos hemos mantenido con opciones hasta el final esto es bueno para el baloncesto espa ol y bueno para el baloncesto de todo el mundo
7250678 es un jugador f sicamente de los m s potentes de este equipo y cuando te enfrentas a estados unidos te afecta
7250679 pero ra l l pez y juan carlos navarro que hab an tenido alg n problema en la fase de preparaci n han sido muy importantes ra l en las semifinales y hoy navarro
7250680 han tenido una gran intensidad y ha superado a otras selecciones estadounidenses anteriores que jugaron campeonatos del mundo y juegos ol mpicos
7250681 it is a case of stepping into the ranks of modernism as the day of the rickety flivver and sleeping on the ground has passed
7250682 we expected to have a marriage and a notice this week but a violent storm prevented the wedding and the doctor being sick himself the patient recovered and we are accordingly cheated out of both items
7250683 the dignity of virginia city once the metropolis of nevada and queen mining city of the world has suffered an affront which authorities declare will not be overlooked
7250684 the parties who had violated the traditional comstock hospitality were on their way over the divide to gold hill when the identity of the piece of furniture in their car was made known they were required to retrace their journey and personally restore the chair to its place at the right of the jury box
7250685 people automatically assume that if it weakens the hazards go down with it but in the case of rainfall its not a function of wind speed
7250686 if we could only have it bigger randall who did the job really outdid himself on this its very nice
7250687 the problem was i was born at the end of the depression and there wasnt money to do anything
7250688 to me it proves weve got a lot of backing here
7250689 when they residents walk in they should be proud of it its very nice
7250690 every week we eat donuts with them and they tell us what they want
7250691 the residents asked for the big 10 network so they could watch their buckeyes in every game
7250692 the brutus on the wall on either side of the large screen lcd television were my idea i stole it from the border copied on a transparency and projected it on the wall then painted them
7250693 i wanted to give them a nice buckeye room i think they enjoy it i may have done the work but bonnie mckee did the decorating she has good taste
7250694 i want a dog ive never had time for a dog
7250695 i could have closed my eyes and gotten more points
7250696 its so draining its like a catharsis at the end
7250697 i have no regrets i wondered about that a few days ago no medal but it was worth it
7250698 i could barely stay in my own skin i was so frustrated
7250699 she looked in my eyes and said you cannot want
7250700 our trainer teaches you how to communicate with the animal during warm up
7250701 liangliang did a good job i would have been mortified if i went over the wrong jump
7250702 what if i came back in four years and improved my fencing
7250703 hey maybe i could lose some weight and do the kentucky derby
7250704 there were times id see tracks and think i was going to be eaten by a bear
7250705 id cry cry all day and my family said its too much sheila
7250706 its an entire generation thats been lost in the shuffle and its a generation thats very different from the one before it and the one after
7250707 its also the first generation that is smaller than the one before it
7250708 the lucky few between the greatest generation and the baby boom
7250709 but after the war those tough times evaporated and the reality exceeded their expectations so they felt really lucky
7250710 theyre healthier living longer and retiring earlier while the younger generations pay for their social security benefits
7250711 birth and fortune the impact of numbers on personal welfare
7250712 no matter who you are you can define yourself as part of a generation
7250713 the circumstances of your generation may help make sense of the way your life has gone you can see the broader currents that have shaped your life the lucky few just happened to have a smoother ride
7250714 basically the technology is here its just a matter of engineering it for the lowest cost the highest reliability and the longest survivability in a hostile and corrosive environment
7250715 perhaps there is a mentality that you cant beat city hall
7250716 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
7250717 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
7250718 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
7250719 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
7250720 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
7250721 thank you for your continued and loyal support over the years this ones on me
7250722 well i didnt have a band and the only means necessary was electronics
7250723 i didnt want to tour by myself because that would suck
7250724 she was one of the first female mechanics and a mechanic for over 50 years shes a great lady and a lot of fun
7250725 stars of the sky legends all illustrated histories of women aviation pioneers
7250726 ive never met anyone who has anywhere near the same accomplishments shes to be admired
7250727 anybody given the same circumstances as i had growing up could have done what i did
7250728 besides all the stuff shes done with aviation mechanics she just loves the cadets
7250729 i think shes great shes very down to earth and doesnt want to be treated special in fact at banquets she doesnt like to sit at the head table she wants to be with the cadets
7250730 we worked together as a team it was incredibly interesting and challenging
7250731 to me flying an airplane is only half of what you should know about an airplane
7250732 if you know the internal systems of your airplane if you get into trouble it can save your life
7250733 its going to be very different from the opening ceremony which was burdened with heavy responsibility to show chinese culture to the world
7250734 it will be simple youthful athletic loud and proud like london entertaining and fun
7250735 this place is a godsend it really is everyone is so nice and i can hear
7250736 i thought gosh how many trips are we going to make here because i have two other kids at home this is really so convenient a lot of times you come in and feel like a number you know in emergencies but i felt very important i had a great experience
7250737 todays opening marks the beginning of a new era in improved access to high quality health care in the region
7250738 this new huntley campus provides superior care to individuals and families living here in the fastest growing region of greater mchenry county centegras commitment to community health and wellness is reflected in this beautifully detailed campus that covers a majority of the health care continuum it is based in the goal to keep residents well beyond expectation with convenient access to medical and wellness services
7250739 the addition of centegra immediate care in the huntley algonquin and lake in the hills communities will provide special services that help residents stay healthy and receive timely high quality and compassionate care
7250740 what we saw during the nomination season was an unprecedented level of interest in this election
7250741 weve seen during the primary season that interest has been at historic levels
7250742 obama has been outspoken about contributions from lobbyists vowing not to accept any contributions from them biden doesnt seem to have quite the same view
7250743 i have done more than any other candidate in this race to take on lobbyists and won
7250744 they have not funded my campaign they will not run my white house and they will not drown out the voices of the american people when i am president
7250745 obama has been using the line about change in washington and changing the people in washington
7250746 highlights obamas lack of experience by picking joe biden with a 30 plus year history in washington
7250747 barack obama decries washington insiders and detests lobbyists but joe biden is the model washington insider
7250748 i was going crazy i was jittery i twitched i trembled i had no patience for anything every single nerve ending was demanding a drink and a cigarette
7250749 i couldnt believe id said it i didnt know why id said it id never said it before
7250750 shimmering dazzling nearly blinding brightness that made me cover my eyes with my hands
7250751 it may have been a church full of pedophiles and criminals covering up other criminals sins it may have been a church riddled with hypocrisy deceit and corruption but our megachurch experience taught us that we were captive catholics
7250752 the eucharist and the presence of the body and blood of christ is in my mind an overwhelming experience for me i find that communion for me is empowering its almost a feeling of a kind of high
7250753 i find it mind boggling that with nearly 70 percent of americans describing themselves as christians and witnessing the success of the passion of the christ and the chronicles of narnia that hollywood still doesnt do the kinds of faith based and family value entertainment that people are desperate to see
7250754 was always fascinated with the darkness i covered countless shootings urban riots and in several situations i was there before police were because i had a police radio and used to drift around the city until something happened
7250755 frankly my life changed from the moment god entered my heart im not interested in the darkness anymore
7250756 ive got four gorgeous boys a wife i adore i love being alive and i love and enjoy every moment of my life my view has brightened and i dont want to go back into that dark place
7250757 he used the word cured a word that oncologists generally dont use
7250758 he said i didnt have to come back for any checks that my tissue had regenerated to the point where you cannot only not tell that there was ever any cancer there but you cant tell that there had been any surgery there
7250759 naomi and i were of course overwhelmed when he told us i think its truly a miraculous blessing
7250760 i think that our deity may have a pretty nasty sense of humor
7250761 to tell the world what he has done for me
7250762 denotes members who are no longer in the senate in the event of a tie scores are ordered alphabetically first by state delegation then by individual members names
7250763 number one you take all the troops out you better have helicopters ready to take those 3 000 civilians inside the green zone where i have been seven times and shot at you better make sure you have protection for them or let them die number one
7250764 no one got up and ran from the room it wasnt that kind of thing
7250765 its not like i had someone holding a gun to my head
7250766 a soldier came by to explain what happened and said if the mortar fire continued they would need to proceed to a shelter
7250767 when mortars are fired into the green zone or surface to air missiles are fired at a plane they dont have names or addresses on them
7250768 the nuance of being shot at or shot near means nothing in a war zone the point sen biden was making is that iraq is a dangerous place for our troops for iraqis for everyone
7250769 veterans dont like it when people mischaracterize their service people who overstate what happens to them
7250770 someone with an ak 47 pops up and is taking shots at you
7250771 unfortunately it fits into his profile and thats exactly why he should be terribly careful about statements that may not quite parse out or deconstruct under scrutiny
7250772 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and is a nice looking guy
7250773 his comments are a blatant slap in the face for foreign minister steinmeir
7250774 anyone who works for gazprom should keep their mouths shut when it comes to subjects which involve russia
7250775 the former chancellor seems to have completely lost his foreign policy perspective
7250776 i cannot help finding it somewhat undignified when an elder statesmen is so exclusively preoccupied with making money
7250777 the higher marginal rates at the top would all else equal tend to reduce economic growth by impeding work and capital accumulation
7250778 i think its a good plan it balances needed investments in energy and education with the need to be fiscally responsible
7250779 increasing the top rates may change how the people at the top realize income
7250780 but it is unlikely to affect how much income they earn
7250781 that puts money in the hands of those most likely to spend it
7250782 the credit reducing the payroll tax for lower income workers is exactly what our economy needs
7250783 many middle income households will face somewhat higher effective marginal tax rates due to the phase outs
7250784 it depends on how obama pays for his tax cut
7250785 if there is no long term borrowing it will not have a long term drag on the economy
7250786 if the obama plan were to solely focus on deficit reduction it would harm the economy
7250787 it is just what the economy needs since our current troubles are likely to move into next year
7250788 theres less than 1 percent of the population of iowa that is african american there is probably less than 4 or 5 percent that are minorities what is in washington so look it goes back to what you start off with what youre dealing with
7250789 half this education gap exists before the kid steps foot in the classroom
7250790 this was not a race based distinction but a discussion of the problems kids face who dont have the same socio economic support system and all that implies nutrition pre k etc entering grade school and the impact of those disadvantages on outcomes
7250791 the bottom line is that no one in the country knows me they know joe biden if they watch sunday morning shows or occasionally turn on c span but absent that they dont know much about me at all
7250792 if i were able to raise 50 60 70 million dollars then things would be different
7250793 the question is can i get others to believe it
7250794 salans opened its moscow office the same year as the moscow times was first published for the foreign community the existence of an independent english language newspaper was one of very few keys to understanding the business political and cultural life of the country and to follow the radical changes russia was going through over the years the newspaper has continued to develop its reputation as a highly regarded source of information and a forum for different points of views on the affairs of russia and its neighbors
7250795 if i were the government and budgeting for the next three years i would be more conservative especially in a country like russia where oil revenues are such a big portion of the budget revenues
7250796 i am not in that arena this is his decision and i respect him to make it however he thinks is best for him and the country
7250797 i think its a fair assessment that ive done more than anybody else in my position
7250798 we are halfway through the reporting season and there have been some good results which helping in getting momentum
7250799 the overall market will benefit retailers will gain from increased confidence in the market from oil falling
7250800 the rise in wall street will also send a good signal
7250801 the market could gain 60 or 70 points on monday
7250802 its very hard to speculate on things that we dont think are going to happen and that are not the base line that we are planning around mr kloppers told abc television today
7250803 i think its a combination of how our commodities versus rios commodities have developed he said
7250804 and i think its fair to say that investors are still waiting sitting on the sideline a little bit to see how we clear our regulatory pre conditions on this deal
7250805 indicated that the proposed takeover raises serious doubts as to its compatibility with the global iron ore market
7250806 may have the ability and incentive to influence global supply and global prices for iron ore lump and fines
7250807 steel makers in australia and overseas could face significantly higher prices for iron ore than bhp billiton and rio tinto would achieve in the absence of the proposed acquisition it said
7250808 i think our result showed that petroleum is a key part of the portfolio mr kloppers said
7250809 one of the reasons why its possible the reserve bank may reduce interest rates in a week or two is because the budget is very strong because the surplus is very substantial mr tanner told network ten
7250810 thered be no way known the reserve bank would be able to contemplate putting down interest rates again
7250811 its slowing somewhat but the reserve bank is still predicting economic growth to be in the order of two per cent
7250812 the end result if they succeed will be that it will be harder for the reserve bank to cut interest rates
7250813 thats why we are putting a 20 year moratorium on all mining activities bulk sampling and exploration over the mcfarlane deposit in the whitsunday region
7250814 the governments oft promoted support for the industries generating queenslands wealth seems to have become hostage to the guerrilla tactics of fringe groups like greenpeace mr roche said
7250815 what next greenpeace resource sector target will have the queensland government folding under a tiny bit of pressure
7250816 this proposal should never have been given serious consideration greenpeace climate campaigner john hepburn said
7250817 ms bligh has made the right decision to prevent any new shale oil projects from taking place in the state but it is an easy decision the next step is to announce a stop the expansion of the coal industry in queensland mr hepburn said
7250818 queensland energy resources proposal came at a time when the worlds scientists are warning that we have as little as 10 years to radically reduce greenhouse pollution if we are to have any chance of avoiding catastrophic climate change

7250820 no one can dispute about the signs of allah but the unbelievers let not then their strutting around through the land deceive you
7250821 and the essence of the quran is the family of ha mim
7250822 when i reach the family of ha mim it is like reaching a beautiful garden so i take my time
7250823 allahs hatred for the people of misguidance when faith is presented to them in this world and they turn away from it and refuse to accept it is greater than their hatred for themselves when they see the punishment of allah with their own eyes on the day of resurrection
7250824 whomever allah sends astray will have no other guide except him
7250825 our lord you have caused us to die twice two deaths and you have given us life twice
7250826 for they were lifeless drops of semen then they were given life then made to die then brought back to life for the resurrection
7250827 will ye slay a man because he says my lord is allah
7250828 allah never sends a messenger to a people and they kill him or some of the believers who call them to the truth then that generation passes away but he then sends them someone who will support their call and will seek vengeance for their blood from those who did that to them in this world so the prophets and believers may be killed in this world but their call will prevail in this world
7250829 allah granted victory to his prophet muhammad and his companions over those who had opposed him disbelieved in him and shown hostility towards him he caused his word and his religion to prevail over all other religions this religion will continue to prevail until the hour begins
7250830 the unbelievers say listen not to this quran but talk at random in the midst of its reading that you may gain the upper hand

7250846 well revert back to residual income driven price targets when we can expect to see some stabilization in consumer delinquencies

7250853 the entire crew of this ship realizes the significance of their efforts in helping to provide comfort to the people of georgia
7250854 mr obamas selection ended a two month search that was conducted almost entirely in secret it reflected a critical strategic choice by mr obama to go with a running mate who could reassure voters about gaps in his r sum rather than to pick someone who could deliver a state or reinforce mr obamas message of change
7250855 on foreign policy and national security an area where john mccain regularly assails obamas lack of experience democrats offer few more seasoned practitioners than biden
7250856 on the democratic side it was a collective phew as the days got nearer for the pick it was hard to find a democrat even savvy clintonites who werent hoping it would be biden only the most strident hillary supporters appear to be upset this morning on the gop side the sound you heard was disappointed silence of everyone on the short list the candidate many republicans least wanted to see obama pick was biden
7250857 balanced against all of those unmatched qualifications is one quality that has afflicted biden for as long as anyone can remember a persistent tendency to say silly offensive and off putting things over the next few days and likely weeks some of bidens ungreatest hits of gab will be recycled by the media and republicans aiming to take the luster off obamas choice of running mate
7250858 obama biden works on several fronts a longtime sentimental favorite among the democratic faithful delaware sen joe biden provides a comfort zone for labor leaders catholics he is one and national security voters although bidens poor fundraising skills doomed his presidential campaigns he performs extremely well in debates and demonstrated considerable skill at shifting from the arcane language of the senate chamber to the street language of the campaign trail
7250859 time will tell if barack obama made the right choice in picking joe biden but if you look at it on paper it makes a whole lot of sense
7250860 obama biden will be a formidable ticket and a risky ticket and not a comfort zone choice for obama
7250861 conservatives will blast bidens record just as surely as liberals will or should celebrate it but one of the virtues of having biden as the vice presidential nominee is that he wont take those kinds of attacks lightly hell fight back hell remind people rightly that being a liberal democrat means raising the minimum wage making sure everybody has affordable health care providing strong public schools and protecting human rights then hell ask why conservative republicans dont want the same things thats exactly the kind of political debate this country needs by picking biden as a running mate obama has signaled that he welcomes this argument and intends finally to win it

7250864 its time to keep the coalition intact as the country is facing serious threats of growing militancy and a worsening economy we have decided to support mr zardari
7250865 if you look at the parameters of pakistani politics theyre real fears and ive been fearing a lot that theyll go back to that kind of confrontation
7250866 if theyre not ready to give a promise what use of going there they have cheated with themselves with us and now with the nation
7250867 we must speed up our work to achieve membership of the european system of security and raise the defense capabilities of the country
7250868 only these steps will guarantee our security and the integrity of our borders
7250869 our countries are linked by years of spiritual cultural and historical ties i believe the main task now is not to allow this precious asset which we inherited from past generations to be wasted

7250910 the whole idea for the game was for the casual market but as we went on we realized that there werent any first person shooters on the market with good graphics on the wii i think a lot of developers that make fpss on the wii say lets do this so the player can use the wii shooter and it doesnt work you lose half your control so when we did it we said lets use the controls for what they were intended for the nunchuck has the throw grenade command on it for a while it was crazy the sensitivity on the wii is almost a nightmare at first if you scratched your nose or turned around if someone came in the room you would throw grenades we got the sensitivity on that so its brilliant its almost second nature now you dont throw the grenade unless you want to we use the wii motion to some degree a lot of games use it and its kind of annoying what we tried to do is really incorporate the easy motions we dont have any of the pull back or push forward ones but we did a little bit of the twist but its subtle a lot of our weapons have a horizontal path if you move the wiimote to the left and right you are actually changing your reticule and the way the bullets travel you can slice through the air and different directions little stuff like that really takes first person shooters to the next level on the wii

7250967 i felt like it was a failure all year i have been jumping around 17 50m and taking off around 20cm behind the board so all i needed to do was what i have been doing all year bang on the board and i would have had 20cm on the guys
7250968 even if i had taken off 20cm behind the board i should have been jumping as far as the winner

7250973 she paid a high price for not having her life as she said herself in an organised fashion

7250975 they found no evidence at all that any cheating was involved she simply now understands how seriously we take the rule regarding whereabouts in our sport
7250976 i was delighted chris won she converted a world championship into an olympic championship i cant tell you how proud and privileged i was to give her the medal
7250977 christine has been embraced in the team here as has every other member she is popular and what happened is behind her
7250978 the anti doping rules are there to catch people cheating they are not there to catch people who make administrative errors
7250979 lets not forget christine was one of the first people to go through this system and i do not think at that stage there was a full understanding of the seriousness of being involved regarding whereabouts
7250980 i do not think anyone goes back thinking there is not a lot of work to be done
7250981 track and field at international level is a tough sport to win a medal you look up at the roof of the birds nest and there are 215 flags
7250982 so it is a universal sport and a tough one but there are some areas clearly middle distance it grieves me to say the standard is not good enough
7250983 essentially a lot these cars just sit guys dont take them out
7250984 this is an event where they can bring them blow the cobwebs off and start enjoying them again

7251081 what is evil but good tortured by its own hunger and thirst verily when good is hungry it seeks food even in dark caves and when it thirsts it drinks even of dead waters you are good when you are one with yourself yet when you are not one with yourself you are not evil for a divided house is not a den of thieves it is only a divided house and a ship without rudder may wander aimlessly among perilous isles yet sink not to the bottom you are good when you strive to give of yourself yet you are not evil when you seek gain for yourself for when you strive for gain you are but a root that clings to the earth and sucks at her breast surely the fruit cannot say to the root be like me ripe and full and ever giving of your abundance for to the fruit giving is a need as receiving is a need to the root in your longing for your giant self lies your goodness and that longing is in all of you

7251136 the numeral system while basically decimal 1 kaike nheva 10 naboto contains only one clear reflex of the poc numerals most strikingly the higher numerals from 20 to 60 have been constructed on the basis of alternating decimal and vigesimal principles the former occurring with odd multiples of ten and the latter with even multiples though this has been obscured by historical change a morpheme that does not occur earlier in the numeral system but with the implied value 20 tutu the numerals 70 90 are decimal based multiples of salai a morpheme with the implied value 10 that does not occur earlier this must surely rank as one of the most bizarre numeral systems attested for an oceanic language and naturally raises questions about possible past contact influences

7251195 engine to sway the public sentiment the public morals and the public religion more powerful than any other in the possession of government
7251196 the purpose in the formation of this party was to get control of the political power of the state so as to be able to use it for establishing our system of schools we hoped by expressing a great love for the people whom we represented as defrauded and oppressed by his employer by denouncing all proprietors as aristocrats and by keeping the more unpopular features of our plan as far in the background as possible we could use it to secure the adoption of our educational system
7251197 form public opinion in favor of education by the state at the public expense and to get such men elected to the legislatures as would be likely to favor our purposes how far the secret organization estended i do not know but i do know that a considerable portion of the state of new york was organized for i was myself one of the agents organizing it

7251202 regionalism has considerable appeal as a world order half way house it seems more feasible in the near term as a step beyond state sovereignty than can be used to dilute nationalist sentiments during a period when glogal loyalties need to grow stronger
7251203 we deplore the division of humankind on nationalistic grounds the best option is to transcend the limits of national sovereignty and to move towards the building of a world community we look toward the development of a system of world law world order based upon transnational government the age of nations must end the governments of the nations have decided to order their separate sovereignties into one government to which they surrender their arms
7251204 we have reached a turning point in human history where the best option is to transcent the limits of national sovereignty and to move towards the building of a world community
7251205 all us us must be subjected to a large degree of social control an equitable distribution of income will be sought the major function of the school is the social orientation of the individual it must seek to give him understanding of the transition to a new social order
7251206 the age of individualism and laissez faire in economy and government is closing a new age of collectivism is emerging it may inviolve the limiting or supplanting of private property by public property almost certainly it will involve a larger measure of compulsory as well as voluntary cooperation of citizens a corresponding enlargement of the functins of government and an increasing state intervention in fundamental branches of economy previously left to individual discretion and initiative
7251207 in the struggle to establish an adequate world government the teacher can do much to prepare the hearts and minds of children at the very top of all the agencies which will assure the coming of world government must stand the school the teacher and the organized profession
7251208 we have swallowed all manner of poisonous certainties fed us by our parents the re interpretation and eventually eradication of the concept of right and wrong which has been the basis of child training these are the belated objectives of practically all effective psychotherapy psychology and sociology the sciences of living should be taught to all children in primary and secondary schools only so can we help our children carry their responsibilities as world citizens we must be prepared to sacrifice much whatever the cost we must learn to live in friendliness and peace putting aside the mistaken old ways of our elders if that is possible if it cannot be done gently it may have to be done roughly or even violently
7251209 the idea has become established that the preservation of international peace and order may require that force be used to compel a nation to conduct its affairs within the framework of an established world system the most modern expression of this doctrine of collective security is in the united nations charter many persons believe that enduring peace cannot be achieved so long as the nation state system continues as a present constituted it is a system of international anarchy
7251210 control real control over the nations children is being shifted rapidly to the nea that organization has about completed the job of cartelizing public school education it is extending that control over colleges and universities in the nea scheme of things it will be a simple matter to extend control over whatever washington agency handles the funds
7251211 the old order is passing social controls cannot be left to blind chance here education must play a stellar role
7251212 many daily decisions and value judgments now made by the individual will soon be made for him how to plan for ones childrens education will be partially taken out of his hands

7251217 authority to negotiate with the soviet academy of sciences which functioned among other things as an intelligence gathering arm of the kgb about curriculum development and the restructuring of american education
7251218 a dozen years ago teaching and learning in global perspective was still exotic doctrine threatening the orthodoxies of those who still thought of american citizenship as an amalgam of american hiustory american geography american lifestyles and american ideas it now seems almost conventional to speak of american citizenship in the same breath with international interdependence
7251219 whats happening in america today is a total transformation of our society we have moved into a new era what the revolution has been in curriculum is that we are no longer teaching facts to children
7251220 ideally the same textbooks should be used all over the world in both the hard sciences and the soft curricula an initiative in this direction has been under way for some years now undertaken by informatick a moscow based educational organization and the carnegie endowment fund
7251221 good will no longer be burdened with a moral coloring good will simply be synonymous with global else whats an education for the emphasis is on homogeneity of minds on the creation and nourishing of a truly global mentality we must all become little transnationalists
7251222 its education council works with educators to integrate world order perspectives into the american curriculum and teacher education
7251223 the practices beliefs and attitudes that are taught in many homes
7251224 the soil has been tilled and the seeds have been planted we now await the blossoming of what john dewey and his followers have worked for since the early 1900s universal socialist internationalist education for world governments planned economy

7251249 we welcome a broader debate about the economy and the opportunity to pit our coherent and consistent long term plans against the liberals short term politics
7251250 after nine months the contrast between our responsible approach and their irresponsible politicking is becoming starker by the day
7251251 our budget settings have been vindicated by current global conditions and our long term policy agenda is substantial
7251252 sometimes i wonder if there is an eagle eye or whether in fact we just have a swan that flaps its wings and squawks very loudly
7251253 the liberals have been in opposition for nine months and still not a peep of a costed economic policy alternative from mr turnbull so far all they have in mind is to irresponsibly punch a hole in the surplus deny medicare tax relief and make rtds ready to drink alcohol mixes cheaper for teenagers
7251254 he couldnt decide whether we cut too hard or not hard enough so he said wed done both
7251255 a combination of costellos 12 rate rises and turnbulls nine months of self promotion has severely damaged any economic credibility the liberals may have once had
7251256 tu non fare il lamento non piangere non versare una lacrima sospira in silenzio e non fare il lutto dei morti avvolgiti il capo con il turbante mettiti i sandali ai piedi non ti velare fino alla bocca non mangiare il pane del lutto

7251259 a lot of women get hit from their husband but i dont know why im really happy he went to jail for a long time he kept me away from all my family my family is happy hes gone away
7251260 it will take me a while to get better i want to move on and find another life i dont want to have another husband i just want to be myself
7251261 it is clear that you are a violent bully with no respect for women and no respect also i might add for orders of the courts
7251262 leaves too much scope for uncertainty for business to continue to invest in existing and new facilities
7251263 the rise of china and india is bringing the centre of gravity of world markets closer to our shores and with it a myriad of opportunities this means that three of the four biggest economies in the world now sit within our region
7251264 australia is finding itself closer to the centre of the world economy than either europe or north america will be at last our geographic position is an advantage not an obstacle
7251265 non fate che trasformare il passato in una storia che vi dia ragione
7251266 la gente si innamora del proprio dolore al punto che non riesce pi ad abbandonarlo siamo noi stessi a tenerci in trappola

7251268 quanto ci piace avere i nostri nemici malvagi noi amiamo i nostri dolori inostri danni ma non lo ammetteremo mai mai
7251269 le parti peggiori della tua vita momenti di cui non puoi parlare ti fanno marcire dallinterno ma le storie che riesci a digerire che puoi raccontare quei momenti del passato li puoi controllare foggiare lavorare dominare e usarli per il tuo stesso bene
7251270 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned
7251271 its a racist law that calls for discrimination and it discriminates between the coptic christians and the muslim donors and made it less likely for sick patients to get their organ transplants
7251272 if some copts are angered by the law then why is it that muslims arent
7251273 for starters it is degrading for both religions if lets say a poor christian has to sell his kidney to a rich muslim or a poor muslim has to sell his kidney to a rich christian it is not right for either religions and that is why we made this law so we can stop organ trafficking

7251305 we have plenty of time to sort through it but they need some time off
7251306 i think theres only one dream team in my opinion
7251307 theres teams that could be close to it but not like that one that team changed a lot of things in basketball and made a lot of young players want to play basketball and want to dedicate themselves to the sport
7251308 i think this team is really very good and played at a very very high level all tournament and theyre close to that team but now i think theres nothing like that

7251318 she said her mother didnt even know what stuyvesant was but she knew from the other moms in the garment factory i need to get my kid into this school
7251319 every time there is a student who maxes out on the sat their picture is prominently placed on the front page in the chinese newspapers
7251320 they give you a pretty good idea of what to expect so even for people whose parents dont speak english they are able to navigate the system
7251321 during the orientation week my sister took me to stuyvesant to ease my mothers fears
7251322 look she knows how to take the subway she knows how to do it on her own she has to go to that school there is no other way
7251323 i will be moving back home because i can save money on the rent and pay for my loans
7251324 there is this ideal in the chinese community when everyone lives together im living at home now
7251325 black americans white americans and puerto ricans seem to share the idea that you must leave home in your teens or early 20s and that there is something wrong with you if you are still living with your parents in your mid 20s

7251330 prescription sleeping pills can be important in certain situations but they can cause a lot of adverse effects and are not a long term solution for older people sleep medication can increase the risk of falling as well as interfering with other medicines
7251331 sleeping pills are not the best way to solve underlying problems like depression or painful conditions that are interfering with a good nights sleep
7251332 most people know that coffee cola or black tea can interfere with their sleep
7251333 but many do not realise that alcohol is one of the major causes of a bad nights sleep

7251363 bis der vor mir pl tzlich langsam wurde da musste ich dann irgendwie ausweichen und zwar ber den randstein und voll in den dreck es war halt einfach auch eine sehr ungl ckliche stelle wo das passiert ist
7251364 und man wird das wohl auch nicht mehr feststellen k nnen weil der reifen beim einschlag ziemlich zerst rt wurde aber tatsache ist dass ich in einer der n chsten kurvem beim einlenken berhaupt keinen grip mehr hatte das auto einfach weggegangen ist und das passiert normal nicht ohne grund ich habe ja nichts anders gemacht als sonst im gegenteil in den runden zuvor habe ich dort zum teil sp ter gebremst mehr riskiert um dichter an soucek ranzukommen ich will einen fehler nicht hundertprozentig ausschlie en aber ich wei es wirklich nicht ich habe keine idee was passiert ist

7251367 over the course of the next few minutes the vehicle is seen a number of times in the neighbourhood by a number of police members and there are some attempts made to stop the vehicle
7251368 all this is subject to investigation but we know that our police member discharged a firearm at the driver of the vehicle the vehicle carried on for a short distance about a block and a 34 year old male was taken into custody and then immediately taken to hospital by ems for treatment of serious injuries
7251369 and then again the same suspect vehicle took a run at this police officer who then discharged his firearm in defence of his life
7251370 its an injury sustained in this incident but not firearm involved he wasnt shot
7251371 they may not have a complete picture of what occurred but they may be able to add a very pertinent piece of information
7251372 we need to do an investigation that looks into use of force by a police officer using a firearm that causes injury
7251373 it puts the emphasis on the amount of time employees put in versus the results
7251374 we need to throw out old programs like the four day work week and institute a results only environment
7251375 some people might benefit from having a daycare situation four days instead of five days
7251376 some might prefer that the day start later than earlier that s why were going to talk it out with the union
7251377 if you do something smartly it might take an hour instead of 100 hours if its done poorly
7251378 the way they compete is to work harder and longer rather than smarter hong kong is relatively competitive but at a high price for workers theyre tired theyre not able to tap their potential hong kong takes twice as long to do what singapore does in less time
7251379 all these athletes have to do is taper off for a short period of time before they set foot into the olympic village and they will test negative and they know that
7251380 i still believe that the use of performance enhancing drugs at the elite level of sport professional as well as olympic is rampant
7251381 the spate of doping cases and investigations in the lead up to the games and the commitment of the ioc to protect the integrity of its event are just some indications that the worldwide fight against doping in sport has made a significant leap forward
7251382 its not an accident that these athletes are coming from countries that do not have an independent anti doping federation in place
7251383 maybe they are very rarely tested during the off season october to december but its surely not adequate
7251384 i would say that those athletes are tested comparatively to countries in any country with a national anti doping organization nado or often more
7251385 this is because of the emphasis the iaaf places in testing in non nado countries
7251386 well be doing in competition testing out of competition testing and target testing
7251387 i cant exactly say how often i cant put a number on it
7251388 subjected to adequate off season testing it would make the results more believable
7251389 perhaps theyre making gains because at last the playing field is level
7251390 theres no systematic doping program like there was in the east germany era there are no cheats from the united states such as marion jones
7251391 perhaps that means that the smaller countries that would otherwise be overwhelmed in terms of finance are able to perform

7251434 jangan begitu saja menerima tawaran parpol partai politik red karena menjadi politisi adalah suatu keahlian dan bakat sehingga tidak otomatis orang yang terkenal atau menjadi public figur termasuk artis menjadi jaminan mampu mengemban tugas sebagai wakil rakyat di lembaga legislatif
7251435 artis harus bisa mengukur kemampuannya bukan menerima tawaran begitu saja
7251436 seperti nurul arifin dan rieke diah pitaloka keduanya memiliki pengalaman dan kemampuan yang sudah teruji di partai politik sehingga layak jika menjadi anggota legislatif

7251444 walau perusahaan perkebunan membayar biaya sebesar 350 ringgit itu lebih dahulu tapi nantinya gaji tki juga yang dipotong
7251445 kalo tki dikenakan 50 ringgit saya masih terima karena mereka masih perlu buat foto 10 ringgit dan transportasi dari perkebunan ke kota tawau tapi jika saya tahu mereka pasang harga 350 pasti saya tolak
7251446 yang penting adalah kontrol terhadap mereka jangan sampai tki diperas bisa saja mereka kerjasama dengan manajemen perusahaan untuk peras tki

7251527 from her recordings it is apparent that jenkins had little sense of pitch and rhythm and was barely capable of sustaining a note her accompanist can be heard making adjustments to compensate for her tempo variations and rhythmic mistakes her dubious diction especially in foreign language songs is also noteworthy nonetheless she became tremendously popular in her unconventional way her audiences apparently loved her for the amusement she provided rather than her musical ability critics often described her work in a backhanded way that may have served to pique public curiosity

7251532 un dif cil reto para londres y las siguientes ciudades organizadoras
7251533 hasta el momento s lo se han detectado seis positivos pero los controles llegan hasta la competici n del mi rcoles y puede haber m s casos
7251534 si aqu ha habido menos casos es porque el efecto disuasorio ha funcionado con m s controles preventivos y tambi n durante los juegos se ha pasado de 3 500 en atenas a 4 500 ahora creo firmemente que la mayor a de los atletas est n limpios y son s lo una minor a los que hacen trampas pero desgraciadamente empa an la imagen del deporte
7251535 china ha puesto el list n muy alto y va a ser un reto muy dif cil de superar para londres y las siguientes ciudades organizadoras mi esperanza es que londres tiene capacidad para superarlo y entonces habremos logrado nuestro objetivo de que el olimpismo evolucione
7251536 atenas fue una vuelta a las ra ces en el pa s donde nacieron los juegos aqu estamos en el pa s m s poblado de la tierra y londres ser la ciudad del pa s que ha hecho las reglas del deporte moderno londres tambi n es una ciudad cosmopolita multi tnica multicultural y multireligiosa eso es un gran activo
7251537 siempre hemos urgido a china para que diera el m s amplio acceso posible cuando descubrimos que algunos portales estaban cerrados inmediatamente intervenimos como ustedes saben con la bbc wikipedia y otros sabemos que la situaci n no ha sido perfecta pero al tiempo es verdad que ha mejorado mucho si lo comparamos con como estaba antes de los juegos
7251538 no olvidemos una cosa el coi no tiene competencia sobre internet la tiene el gobierno chino
7251539 lo hemos discutido con el bocog y nos han dicho que se ha aplicado la ley china algo que tenemos que respetar
7251540 el gobierno chino nunca prometi que habr a zonas para manifestaciones sino que fue el coi el que le pidi que lo hiciera aunque no est en el contrato de obligaciones que se firma con la ciudad organizadora sabemos que accedieron a establecer esas zonas de protesta y que se solicitaron 77 actos pero nunca hemos tenido conocimiento de que se llevaran a cabo
7251541 ha avanzado mucho en materia de medio ambiente y no s lo en las dos semanas de los juegos con reforestaciones prohibici n de veh culos con alta contaminaci n entre otras medidas este es otro de los legados de los juegos
7251542 i would never put myself in the same category as phelps or usain bolt theyre multiple gold medallists but i think just because it was chinas national sport and they were so sure to win it was one of their definite events
7251543 i dont think it will sink in for a while
7251544 i know i have a medal because i can feel it i can touch it and i can see it but it doesnt feel like gold
7251545 winning an olympic gold medal and being the very best in the world is something i cant comprehend yet
7251546 i left the sport without any intention of returning i had fallen out of love with diving
7251547 i wouldnt be here if i hadnt taken the time off i know it for sure because i came back with such a drive and such fierce competitive spirit
7251548 chava called me up one day and said no pressure but if ever you want to start diving again im very happy to coach you
7251549 then march 2007 was the melbourne world championships and i was getting all these messages from my diving friends who are all from overseas saying you should be here
7251550 i really wanted to go but couldnt afford the flight down to melbourne so i started training not long after that because i didnt want to miss something like that again
7251551 its a little bit emotional because i know everything i did all the sacrifices i made and how hard i had to work and its all paid off

7251572 i would have thought that he has a chance of playing for the first team soon he is back here and hes up for selection
7251573 but he is a little bit behind the others because he has missed all of pre season
7251574 that is what we are trying to catch up on but it wont make any difference if we are home or away when i play him
7251575 if liverpool keeps on playing like they did against sunderland and boro
7251576 if liverpool keeps on playing like they did against sunderland and boro
7251577 we came in at halftime and talked about this being a grimy game we knew it was going to be a grimy game it was a hard fought battle a defensive battle if you will the difference in the first half was they scored a touchdown after they got a turnover and we kicked a field goal i liked the mettle of the guys i liked the way they fought
7251578 i think it was a terrible performance on my part
7251579 we didnt come out and game plan too much we have some things we need to correct on offense i am disappointed with my play i think we had some good opportunities missed on my part and we have to make sure it doesnt happen again
7251580 it was priceless the situations we were able to get byron leftwich in and he delivered for us
7251581 playing from behind some hurry up ball all and all it was a good night it was part of his growth and development of being a steeler he took advantage of it i thought he had poise i thought he delivered the ball to some guys in some critical situations nothing we havent seen him do before but we have never seen him do it in a steelers uniform

7251604 il discorso cambia radicalmente con il secondo gruppo gli antikhytera mechanism dietro a questo nome quasi impronunciabile si nasconde una sorpresa estremamente positiva ovvero un quartetto dal look decisamente sobrio ma dalla musica eccezionale un genere complesso che potrebbe essere definito come un incrocio tra le sonorit dei tool e quelle dei fates warning con lunghi brani che solitamente iniziano in sordina magari addirittura in acustico e poi si evolvono gradualmente acquistando una sempre maggiore complessit uno di quei gruppi insomma in cui la tecnica diventa la cosa principale da seguire con attenzione in ciascuna delle loro evoluzioni altrimenti c il rischio di perdersi una delle esibizioni migliori della serata per un gruppo da seguire se possibile considerando tra laltro la giovane et dei suoi componenti
7251605 hai detto che sono intelligente sensibile simpatica ma non hai detto bella
7251606 vuol dire che bella non il primo aggettivo che ti viene in mente pensando a me
7251607 intendi dire che stai con me solo perch sono bella
7251608 prima dimentichi di dire che sono bella poi dici che sono
7251609 niente che devo avere ti ho solo fatto una domanda
7251610 oh certo ora io aggredisco piuttosto tu perch ti sei messo sulla difensiva
7251611 come mai io ti faccio delle semplici domande e tu mi dici che ti aggredisco
7251612 insomma a me non sembrava una domanda cos difficile io saprei cosa rispondere se tu mi chiedessi perch ti amo
7251613 certo perch a te non te ne frega niente di quello che provo io
7251614 se te ne fregasse qualcosa mi chiederesti perch ti amo
7251615 a parte il fatto che non sai perch mi ami che non mi trovi bella e che non te ne frega niente di quello che provo a parte questo niente va tutto benissimo

7251756 hai idea di quanto importante tu sia per me riesci a renderti conto di quanto ti amo
7251757 di tre cose ero del tutto certa primo edward era un vampiro secondo una parte di lui chiss quale e quanto importante aveva sete del mio sangue terzo ero totalmente incondizionatamente innamorata di lui
7251758 quando la carta mi tagli il dito lo alzai per esaminare il danno dalla ferita invisibile colava una minuscola goccia di sangue poi accadde tutto molto velocemente edward si lanci verso di me scagliandomi dallaltra parte del tavolo ero caduta vicino al pianoforte gettando le braccia in avanti per proteggermi in mezzo alle schegge di vetro affilate dal polso al gomito ormai il dolore minvadeva acuto e bruciante confusa e disorientata cercai di non badare al rosso vivo del sangue che mi colava dal braccio e incrociai gli sguardi eccitati di sei vampiri improvvisamente famelici
7251759 nel silenzio assoluto unintuizione improvvisa rimise ogni dettaglio al suo posto cera qualcosa di cui edward non aveva voluto parlarmi qualcosa che jacob non mi avrebbe tenuta nascosta qualcosa che aveva attirato i cullen e i lupi nella foresta e li aveva fatti avvicinare pericolosamente tuttavia stavo aspettando proprio quel momento lo temevo ed ero pronta ad affrontarlo malgrado desiderassi con tutta me stessa che non arrivasse mai ma i miei guai non potevano aver fine vero

7251788 accordingly if a business located outside new york state solicits sales of taxable tangible personal property or services through employees salespersons independent contractors agents or other representatives located in new york state the business must register as a vendor and obtain a certificate of authority for new york state sales tax purposes
7251789 all of its sales to new yorkers or face hefty civil and criminal penalties
7251790 the seller enters into an agreement or agreements with a new york state resident or residents under which for a commission or other consideration the resident representative directly or indirectly refers potential customers to the seller whether by link on an internet web site or otherwise a resident representative would be indirectly referring potential customers to the seller where for example the resident representative refers potential customers to its own web site or to another partys web site which then directs the potential customer to the sellers web site

7251801 is that i wish a woman would have been on the ticket but alas america is not ready to embrace and support having a woman on the ticket top or otherwise
7251802 this is a guy who can out straight talk the straight talk express
7251803 you might not always like what joe says but hes going to give it to you straight
7251804 but in terms of their approach to things they are very similar i was a big supporter of chet in regard to that process we all knew it was a long shot
7251805 i still believe that hillary clinton would have been a better choice for obama
7251806 selecting senator clinton would have unified my party in ways that no other pick could reigniting the enthusiasm of 18 million hillary supporters
7251807 id be happy but the convention hasnt started yet so we need to follow procedure
7251808 i dont think barack would do it or hillary would accept
7251809 it would have been smart of him to name her as his sidekick because she got half the vote
7251810 there are going to be a significant number of people who are going to hold a grudge
7251811 im disappointed as it apparently seems that in the race for the white house its a mans world after all
7251812 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
7251813 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
7251814 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
7251815 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
7251816 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7251817 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
7251818 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
7251819 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
7251820 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
7251821 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
7251822 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
7251823 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
7251824 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
7251825 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
7251826 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
7251827 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
7251828 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
7251829 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
7251830 this is for my 78 year old lifelong democrat father who has already booked his ticket to fly out here in hopes of getting in
7251831 she wanted it for her mother who campaigned for kennedy and was browse a gallery of images from the dnc prepped pepsi center browse a gallery of images preparations parties and protests in advance of the convention view street closures alternative route info view street closures and protest parade route for aug 25 27 view protest parade route for thursday aug 28 wondering if id had any luck
7251832 i called all the people i knew in middle tennessee politics
7251833 no one had tickets they were sort of left out
7251834 i have worked for him so i put a little pressure there
7251835 i kept calling and they said no were blocked off for dnc week
7251836 i talked to a friend of mine who was a really good buddy of al gores and he said he was going to try to get me some way to get in the convention during the week
7251837 whether someone helps win you an election i think is kind of a side benefit you certainly want to pick someone who doesnt hurt you
7251838 except in three cases that of their wives their daughters and their girlfriends
7251839 im a hillary delegate even so im a democrat first
7251840 i will do exactly what my candidate tells me to do
7251841 her election was really important to me i could feel it from my toes to my head but now i am supporting obama and im going to whatever i can do
7251842 there is no way the democrats are not going to come home
7251843 if we lose this election we ought to quit just quit
7251844 im going to vote and work for him but im not drinking the kool aid
7251845 my concern is that he has a compelling message of hope and change but that hasnt converted to numbers and votes
7251846 he is struggling in national polls i dont think im the only democrat who feels this way
7251847 he is a good person a good democrat i know he has the reputation for sticking his foot in his mouth but i like the fact that he is kind of a straight shooter
7251848 they have to get out of themselves and understand that the presidential election is about the course of history
7251849 i respect hillary clintons candidacy enormously i believe strongly in her
7251850 we the people are responsible and accountable for what does or does not happen in washington and the fact is is too many american families are following the bad example of the federal government theyre spending more money than they make theyre charging their credit cards taking out home equity loans mortgaging their future

7251868 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7251869 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7251870 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7251871 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7251872 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7251873 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7251874 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7251875 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7251876 i think bidens gaffes tend to be pretty superficial they dont reflect a fundamental lack of knowledge or empathy far from it so much as a certain ham fistedness in putting words together this is almost entirely forgivable and unlikely to create long term problems
7251877 i voted for the bill before i voted against it
7251878 i think people in the united states can get a little irritated by my work
7251879 frustrated even they think im a clever clever boy but ive found its okay to be in a state of conflict and opposition you dont want to be too embraced
7251880 at least as long as i can get up and down the stairs
7251881 the three set in europe were told to me by other writers and my publisher while the newark story happened to my stepfather he was actually there when the mayor broke down and cried in the middle of the riot
7251882 a coup by legal and political means the reality is that al gore was elected which means were living in an alternate universe an alternate reality like owen brick in the real world there would be no war in iraq no torture at abu ghraib and possibly just possibly no 9 11
7251883 the idea that this great man should have to suffer the loss of such a fine son is appalling
7251884 i wrote man in the dark during a very short period of time
7251885 just four months it kept writing itself it was the most intense experience ive ever had as a writer
7251886 i write everything by hand paragraph by paragraph and then at the end of the day i type up what ive written usually 1 000 words on a typewriter when the book is done ill do handwritten corrections then retype it all on the typewriter i wrote a screenplay on a computer once and hated it so much that i vowed i would never do it again i got carpal tunnel and wound up having to wear a brace
7251887 most of whats on it is false ill give readings where the person introducing me will provide information that is simply wrong ill ask them where they got it and invariably theyll say the internet
7251888 novels are about inner life about the experience of being in the world from inside
7251889 films are about life from the outside rarely do they touch the depths of novels
7251890 once we were done we had a screening for the distributor after saying how much he liked it he added almost as an afterthought that it had no commercial potential at all thats just how it is these days especially in america theres no life left for marginal films
7251891 i dont know why im gravitating toward stories about death
7251892 its probably nothing more than a function of getting older
7251893 its good to inhabit a young person again especially in that era
7251894 his mailbox read the bill smith not bill smith but the bill smith
7251895 if not reversed these developments together with a pace of growth that is likely to fall short of potential for a time should lead inflation to moderate later this year and next
7251896 at times of extraordinary volatility and dramatic risk re pricing maintaining price stability could be the best contribution that monetary policy could give to the return to financial stability
7251897 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7251898 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7251899 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7251900 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7251901 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7251902 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7251903 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7251904 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7251905 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7251906 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7251907 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7251908 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7251909 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7251910 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7251911 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7251912 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7251913 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7251914 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7251915 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7251916 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7251917 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7251918 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7251919 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7251920 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7251921 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7251922 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7251923 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7251924 republican always always campaign by protraying the democratic candidate as an out of touch elitist
7251925 democrats in general and obama in particular have trouble connecting with working class voters
7251926 mccain s a graduate of annapolis i know a lot of the annapolis breed remember i m west point where i was born my father went there
7251927 so the obama campaign is going all out on the issue of mccain s multiple houses isn t that kind of stupid
7251928 because of possible first amendment violations requests for reporters phone records are supposed to receive an even higher level scrutiny before they can be approved usually requiring the approval of the attorney general or other high ranking justice department officials
7251929 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
7251930 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
7251931 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
7251932 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
7251933 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
7251934 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
7251935 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
7251936 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
7251937 est que apr s tre mari on saimera comme on saime mnt
7251938 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7251939 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7251940 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7251941 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7251942 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7251943 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7251944 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7251945 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it

7251950 an established writer on a soap opera like coronation street who also has income from previous programmes residuals might easily earn in excess of 150 000 a year if you are a poet however and one of your published poems is read on television you will be paid around 30 per half minute and might well starve to death
7251951 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
7251952 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
7251953 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
7251954 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
7251955 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7251956 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7251957 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list

7251960 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7251961 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection

7251963 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7251964 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7251965 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7251966 the web has a particular architecture and it makes sense that if you are deploying a service or api on the web then it should take advantage of this architecture instead of fighting against it there are millions of deployed clients servers and intermediaries that support rest and it makes sense to be compatible with their expectations
7251967 apple would gain nothing from telegraphing its intentions and capabilities by releasing public conceptual products the company is being more than prudent by not displaying their unconstrained fantasies to competitors media investors or customers
7251968 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7251969 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7251970 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes

7251974 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7251975 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7251976 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7251977 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7251978 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7251979 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
7251980 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7251981 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7251982 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7251983 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7251984 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7251985 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7251986 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7251987 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7251988 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
7251989 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
7251990 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7251991 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7251992 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7251993 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7251994 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7251995 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7251996 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
7251997 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
7251998 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
7251999 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
7252000 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
7252001 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7252002 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7252003 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7252004 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7252005 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7252006 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything

7252023 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
7252024 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
7252025 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
7252026 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
7252027 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
7252028 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
7252029 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
7252030 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7252031 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
7252032 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
7252033 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
7252034 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
7252035 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
7252036 oh weve got more important things we have to do
7252037 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7252038 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7252039 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7252040 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7252041 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7252042 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7252043 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7252044 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7252045 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7252046 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7252047 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7252048 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7252049 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7252050 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7252051 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7252052 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7252053 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done

7252073 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7252074 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7252075 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7252076 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
7252077 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
7252078 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
7252079 he couldnt face it and change he couldnt handle it thats the difference between you and him

7252121 there were no changes in the position of russian peacekeepers overnight but we are expecting that they will withdraw from poti today
7252122 every job is a self portrait of the person who did it autograph your work with excellence
7252123 if we do not change course in iraq soon youre going to see two years from now helicopters hovering over our embassy in the green zone in baghdad with people hanging
7252124 my sense is that we have achieved tactical momentum and wrested the initiative from our enemies in a number areas of iraq we are in short a long way from the goal line but we do have the ball and we are driving down the field
7252125 general petraeus or general betray us cooking the books for the white house
7252126 we can call it quits and withdraw from iraq i think that would be a gigantic mistake or we can set a deadline for pulling out which i fear will only encourage our enemies to wait us out equally a mistake
7252127 i can tell you that joe biden gets it hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7252128 thats because he is still that scrappy kid from scranton who beat the odds the dedicated family man and committed catholic who knows every conductor on that thats the kind of fighter who i want by my side in the months and years to come
7252129 you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7252130 wir m ssen dies auch mit dem bundestag und der bundesregierung bereden die bisherigen mittel reichen nicht wir wollen auch in vier jahren f nfter werden die arbeit f r london 2012 beginnt am montag
7252131 bis 2008 hatten wir pro jahr 70 millionen euro f r die fachverb nde und die olympiast tzpunkte bis 2012 werden es jedes jahr 12 millionen mehr sein also jeweils 82 doch wir ben tigen die doppelte zuwachsrate

7252135 moramo se zavzemati da ne bo vse skoncentrirano v ljubljani

7252138 verjamem da bo stranka dosegla e bolj i rezultat kot na zadnjih volitvah ljudje so v teh tirih letih spoznali da delamo dobro in da smo na pravi poti
7252139 i felt mcmanus handled it and okay everyone makes mistakes but you feel disappointed about it
7252140 im not going to say to much about thesecond goal but from where im sitting that one was offside
7252141 i wonder if its maybe pre meditated or maybe its just me wee gus and craig levein
7252142 we certainly deserved a point i thought we were unlucky to go behind
7252143 theyre a big strong team and they were causing us problems i think we rectified that in the second half
7252144 van de zestigduizend bezoekers van het dancefestival werden er 33 door de politie in de kraag gevat
7252145 when you get to the end of your rope tie a knot and hang on
7252146 i reassured him that everyone at the club was excited about him being back
7252147 so i couldnt imagine the supporters wouldnt be the same
7252148 we maybe didnt play as well as we should have in the first half hour but once we introduced shaun that helped as well
7252149 evening im at the birds nest with the pms of latvia and nepal and the spanish infanta always wanted to meet her
7252150 sorry loose cannon see below its not a minority view i dont care if we win 20 or no medals i would like a scottish team im embarrassed how anyone could stand and sing god save the queen be they english or scottish
7252151 what stewart maxwell seems to have ignored with his petty comments is that chris hoys success is built on the funding that only a british team can muster concentrated on the cycling centre in manchester
7252152 re scottish sports minister i cringe when these narrow minded views of the minority in scotland make their way into the media i apologise on behalf of all proud british scots well done team gb
7252153 i have been totally transfixed by the olympics for the last two weeks i have held my breath then cheered screamed and cried tears of joy for winners and tears of heartbreak for those who just missed out i am proud to be british well done team gb
7252154 closing ceremony should be interesting jimmy page leona lewis david beckham and boris johnson lets hope that he doesnt trip over the olympic flag and or cause an international incident
7252155 if you look at jamaica a small island nation they won gold silver and bronze in the womens sprint
7252156 theyve got world records theyve won the mens the womens 100 and 200 metres and the relay a scottish team at the olympics is the future
7252157 apparently im gonna be on a london bus going into the stadium the top of the bus opens and obviously jimmy and leona are performing and then i receive a football and kick it into the athletes
7252158 when i was a teenager i was a hurdler i was pretty quick but it got in the way of my guitar playing
7252159 just watched the irish lad box it seemed every time he hit the chinese boxer they gave the point to the wrong boxer the irish should protest
7252160 having just watched the gold medal clash for the 81kg weight category im left wondering if the judges were watching something else egan was clearly the winner there has to be an investigation into the boxing scoring
7252161 i decided to check out some photos of the beijing national stadium and the proposed london 2012 one if the beijing national stadium is nicknamed the birds nest what can we expect for the london 2012 stadium the cupcake
7252162 just been watching the boxing and it occured to me that cuba have won no golds in their traditionally strong sport they must be sick as parrots
7252163 seb coe says he has creative teams working on the 2012 olympics i hope theyre not the same creative people who designed that dreadful logo
7252164 david beckham is bigger than jesus in china so he gets the handover vote
7252165 as a proud scot i have really enjoyed these games team gb have been great i think the idea of a separate scottish team is stupid we compete separately at the commonwealth games and i cant wait till london or 2014
7252166 by my calculation scotland would be 25th on the medal table not as good as fourth ill grant you but better than the 36th that team gb achieved in 1996
7252167 great olympics for gb and an excellent platform for 2012 can gb replicate becky adlington and the cycling heroes in athletics for london
7252168 keep the olympics going its nice to wake up with hazel irvine in the morning
7252169 if taekwondo is removed from the olympics then that would be a kick in the teeth
7252170 i always thought that if baseball can get into the olympics then cricket should be allowed in too especially twenty20 but that would ignite the whole gb england argument again
7252171 there is a feeling that we wont survive the next vote
7252172 concerning rhythmic gymnastics my daughter won regional championships in canada and the us and had a chance to train with an elite team in china my daughter trained 24 hours a week and attended school for about 34 hours a week the chinese girls aged 10 and up trained 46 hours a week and attended school for 10 hours a week no contest
7252173 im looking forward to going back to school i cant believe i just said that but im looking forward to seeing my friends and just being a normal kid
7252174 you are right about the rhythmic gymnastics its five in the morning and i cant stop watching it
7252175 chris hoy but hes from the newly independent olympic state of scotland
7252176 it is a huge honour to be carrying the flag at the closing ceremony when you consider the standard of the team it is a very special honour for me
7252177 like many scots i would feel greater pride watching the flag of scotland rise up the olympic pole than the uk flag that the world calls england
7252178 they went off so quickly in the first kilometre i deliberately backed off the pace but i always thought more athletes would start coming back and they did im a little disappointed not to make the top 20 but you can only do what you can
7252179 our middle and long distance effort really has collapsed hasnt it i remember as a kid in the 1980s that it seemed to be a main focus for our sporting excellence its a shame thats been lost

7252181 speaking as a scot im embarrassed yet again by the scottish government this is britain scotland will still be part of britain in 2012 and so should be part of the british team
7252182 is this going to be a scottish team backed by the same level of british money thrown at the gb team for this olympics come on lets get real
7252183 im a scot and i hate the idea of having split national teams ive really enjoyed the uk coming together and enjoying each others successes collectively as team gb
7252184 scotland can compete on the world stage we proved that in the olympics and a scottish team at the olympics is the future
7252185 why is it reckless to go fast whilst its cooler then slow down how could the chase pack catch up in the heat in the last half
7252186 check how greece have done four years on from hosting the olympics no golds two silver two bronze wonder where gb will be in 2016
7252187 all ive heard over the last couple of days is how 2012 is going to be poor in comparison to beijing i know us brits are a pessimistic bunch but honestly not since the reintroduction of the wispa bar has anything this exciting happened to this country i for one will enjoy it whatever
7252188 re chris in edinburgh see 0058 if everyone had such a negative attitude then wed get nowhere i for one cant wait for 2012 we should be proud we have the olympics
7252189 im an east end boy and im proud that its happening in london i was very proud to be involved in the first place bringing it back to england and to london its going to generate so much interest in sport and kids are already getting excited about it we have seen what the chinese have done here and im sure we will better that without a doubt
7252190 evening keeping an eye on the updates on my phone whilst spinning tunes in a nightclub shuts at 2 so should catch the end on tv cmon dan

7252194 dna chips have revolutionised biological and medical science for many years scientists have tried to develop similar protein chips but technical difficulties associated with attaching large numbers of proteins to surfaces have prevented their widespread application
7252195 the method we have developed could have profound applications in the diagnosis of disease screening of new drugs and in the detection of bacteria pollutants toxins and other molecules
7252196 our study shows that if you have a dense rigid matrix the cells will be more aggressive and invasive its a direct effect
7252197 if you have enough invadopodia over time theyll make large holes that cells can move through to invade and metastasize
7252198 we thought that more stuff for the cells to get through was going to make it harder so we expected to see less matrix degradation but instead we found this interesting effect where cells actually sense the rigidity and degrade more
7252199 the idea that tissue rigidity leads to a more aggressive phenotype had been out there for a while
7252200 but it hadnt actually been tied to matrix degradation which is thought to be important for metastasis and spread of cells through the body

7252204 escrts are like the recycling units of the cell they oversee the constant intake break down and replenishing of junctions on the cell surface
7252205 in a cancer cell where escrts are damaged the junctions may not be restored properly this can cause cells to separate and migrate to form secondary tumours in other parts of the body
7252206 previous studies have shown a link between escrts and the loss of junctions in cells of fruit flies so we want to see whether this is also true in humans
7252207 this work should tell us more about the role of escrts in cancer and provide possible new targets for therapy in the future

7252209 a species of red algae for instance produces under increased ultraviolet radiation less red light harvesting proteins thus decreasing the absorption of radiation the typical red colour of the alga fades and the plant gets white tips
7252210 the algae additionally produce substances which react similar to melanin in human skins mycosporin amino acids maa
7252211 we examine the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation on algae and their protective mechanisms
7252212 our investigations show that the distribution of certain species of brown algae is inhibited by the climate of ultraviolet radiation the algae are displaced into deeper water layers if ultraviolet radiation increases

7252415 we do believe in de villiers plan and we worked hard at what we wanted to do this week
7252416 we created opportunities but just made too many mistakes and for international players that is unacceptable
7252417 if we replace them now with one game left you would have to start from scratch
7252418 we have only pride left to play for the players must do justice to themselves and to their country

7252423 war made easy how presidents and pundits keep spinning us to death
7252424 the argument billionaires bloggers and the battle to remake democratic politics
7252425 a man who lives in a box for five years can do whatever he wants
7252426 it branded obama as the sole contender with the un beltway biography credibility and political talent to link the promise of change to the nations onrushing generational turnover in all its cultural and yes racial manifestations mccain should be a far easier mark than clinton if obama retools his act
7252427 mccains attacks on obama have worked in last weeks los angeles times bloomberg poll obamas favorable rating declined from 59 to 48 percent and his negative rating rose from 27 to 35
7252428 the argument against obamas going negative is that it undermines his message of transcendent politics and will make him look like an angry black man but pacifistic politics is an oxymoron and obama is constitutionally incapable of coming off angrier than mccain a few more fisticuffs from the former law professor and many more from his running mate and other surrogates can only help make him look less skinny metaphorically if not literally obama should go after mccains supposedly biggest asset experience much as mccain went after obamas crowd drawing celebrity
7252429 its just tragic and yet we believe we offer up a place of hope
7252430 obamas decision to choose him is an exceptionally good choice that shows that obama is trying to unite all democrats behind him
7252431 he would never make the same categorizations as former us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld who spoke of an old and new europe
7252432 bidens nomination is obamas attempt to balance his small foreign policy experience when compared to republican presidential candidate john mccain
7252433 this can lead to tension within obamas campaign which has been promoting a change away from the establishment
7252434 should obama win the election there will be a different foreign policy thanks to biden than the one under a republican mccain
7252435 obama and biden on the other hand will pursue a dialog the same is true when talking about iran by the way
7252436 they say that our aggression our toughness came out of our slave situation
7252437 considering that jamaica had more slavery rebellion than any country in the world
7252438 its not a question of genetic pool but we have that
7252439 its a cultural thing too that we want to achieve
7252440 i think that he knows full well that his athletes have been using drugs
7252441 he set out to set up a lab to cheat they caught him he went to prison and now hes casting aspersions on other people who have stayed in this sport the last 40 years and have been clean
7252442 from 1948 until now we have been coming to the olympics in sprints ok and we have done well this is just a culmination of what has gone on for more than 40 years
7252443 which is difficult to translate exactly but could be said to mean though we may be small we are powerful beyond expectations
7252444 at the end of the day though there is a culture of track that the jamaicans have now mastered at a very high level
7252445 if usain bolt were born in north america or europe he would be now earning far more money as a professional basketball player with the odds of a much longer and more lucrative career
7252446 once upon a time they were saying we have it because we have fast fibers
7252447 so i said to them how many countries have fast fibers only a few areas in the world ah these are theories that dont hold strong when you have a complex situation
7252448 we passed exams at universities abroad because of the strength where other blacks failed
7252449 we feel because other people are now caught the playing field is now more level for us
7252450 all of them trained in the states and we caught them down in kingston
7252451 you remember that guy who believed in god so strongly
7252452 our athletes are strong believers in the almighty they believe that without the almighty they can do nothing and with the almighty they actually can do everything
7252453 we know that our athletes have trained hard that the country would not tolerate any kind of cheating because we are a moral christian country
7252454 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who
7252455 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7252456 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7252457 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7252458 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit p off even william hartnell the first doctor had trouble back then he was often ill and forgot his lines
7252459 hay la misma impotencia que en el 11 m pero menos rabia contenida
7252460 a long process but it always pointed in bidens direction
7252461 many others were discussed but my impression was that those three a few weeks ago were really the centerpiece kaine bayh and biden
7252462 we made the final three in a competition where they dont give out silver and bronze medals
7252463 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7252464 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7252465 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7252466 you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of privatizing social security
7252467 you cant change america and end this war in iraq when you declare and again these are johns words no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have end of quote ladies and gentlemen you cant change america you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7252468 in the aftermath i had to remake my health my reputation and my career in the senate
7252469 theres no political point worth anybodys life out there none
7252470 he has this air of perfection and joe biden is more down to earth
7252471 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7252472 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7252473 most people feel that if she wanted to press to be vice president she would have made a bigger push for it
7252474 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
7252475 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
7252476 democratic leaders know that these counterproductive proposals will not become law
7252477 they need to stop standing in the way of expanding domestic production and take meaningful steps now to address the pain caused by high energy prices
7252478 when congress returns they should remove this restriction so we can get these vast oil resources from the ocean floor to your gas tank
7252479 his economic plan is four more years of george bushs economic plan
7252480 four more years of record spending record deficits record giveaways to the special interests and a reckless disregard for the middle class
7252481 will lay out a new direction for jump starting our economy and rebuilding a strong middle class
7252482 everything from gas to groceries health care to college tuition has gone up
7252483 his humble pennsylvania roots give him a deep understanding of the challenges facing ohio families
7252484 as ohioans we will look at the top of the ticket and ultimately compare john mccain to barack obama
7252485 a compelling fighter for the middle class with a profound understanding of the dangerous world we live in and a track record of bringing people together to take on tough issues
7252486 biden can probably take apart anybody that mccain chooses and do it with a stiletto and a smile
7252487 we have not seen this type of combination in a presidential ticket for decades
7252488 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7252489 we have gathered today to get back our land money cannot compensate our loss
7252490 never go in against a sicilian when death is on the line
7252491 never let your name be found in a dead mans trousers
7252492 other towers other turrets protruded from the medieval ch teau they called the temple deceptively religious name but this tower was different larger easily 60 feet in height and black like the inside of a chimney and lord of all its secrets whatever was in there stayed there
7252493 legend has it that if you give vidocq two or three of the details surrounding a given crime he will give you back the man who did it before youve had time to blink
7252494 more than that hell describe the man for you give you his most recent address name all his known conspirators tell you his favorite cheese
7252495 al grito de olavaria cuidado que la cuerda se puede romper
7252496 do the rights of religious freedom and free speech as guaranteed in both the federal and the california constitutions exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination based on a persons sexual orientation our answer is no
7252497 all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal and no matter what their sex race color religion ancestry national origin disability or medical condition are entitled to the full and equal accommodations advantages facilities privileges or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever
7252498 it really is as if california has banned its citizens from having moral consciences
7252499 you must merely obey what the state says you have no right to follow your own moral guide
7252500 these were doctors who did not feel right morally about performing the procedure they actually treated the lady in many aspects but at a certain point said no we cant participate in this for moral reasons because the person is not married and referred her to another doctor who would have provided the treatment but just couldnt do it immediately
7252501 imagine somebody who runs a store for maternity clothing who refuses to serve single women or gay women because the owner believes that it is immoral for such a woman to have had sex let alone to have a child
7252502 up until the 1960s the courts general view was that the free exercise of religion clause in the u s constitution does not give anybody the right to exemption
7252503 discrimination against healthcare professionals on the basis of their sincerely held ethical standards
7252504 s tu mismo la soluci n y el mundo que t quieres para los dem s
7252505 in a place like this that seems so empty you have two people who came out to find their dream if thats not an example of californias gold i dont know what is
7252506 in kosovo there was a un presence there was also the issue of ethnic cleansing there was a standstill in negotiations no chance for a negotiated settlement all these different things came into play
7252507 without the issue of kosovos independence i dont think that we would have seen this georgia story unfurl as quickly as it has
7252508 those opposed to recognizing kosovos independence feared above all that it would unleash a series of declarations of independence but that provoked the intervention of one state georgia which wanted to keep control of all its territory
7252509 the backdrop behind russias moves was the wests behavior in kosovo with the launching in 1999 of a military operation without a united nations mandate and then recognizing its independence despite moscows opposition
7252510 more interested in maintaining an unclear situation in the two rebel georgian regions which would allow them to intervene when they wish
7252511 russia cant expect a lot of countries to follow suit if it recognizes the independence of the two regions
7252512 for their part western nations havent got the means to put effective pressure on russia the most likely scenario is that the conflict will become frozen again and in the long term there will have to be a wider agreement between the permanent members of the un security council
7252513 not at all i was a good friend of davids even before he got the role of the doctor and hes the most delightful chap
7252514 plus theres the fact that we come from the same area of scotland
7252515 id love it if the next doctor who was also scottish
7252516 hed crack up the daleks with a few well timed gags then afterwards they wouldnt be so morose
7252517 they might even come to the conclusion that you dont have to rule the universe to have some fun
7252518 after it was cancelled i fought for years to make executives change their minds so its good to know that i was right all along
7252519 luckily ive had my own wee bit of fan fervour last year i was also in stratford acting opposite ian mckellen in king lear
7252520 loads of doctor who fans came along to watch and get autographs afterwards
7252521 i didnt mind that they still thought of me as a time lord
7252522 it just meant that the doctor was steering people towards shakespeare which is no bad thing
7252523 people who listen to the music might think its sweet but in reality its about people being threatened with torture and execution
7252524 although its set in japan gilbert and sullivan were actually writing about the britain of the victorian era
7252525 we were doing a lot of nasty stuff back then with our empire
7252526 these days you could look at the mikado as a piece about american or russian imperialism
7252527 i decided to do it for a bet me and my school friend danny sweeney bet each other that wed go down and tell the local priest that we wanted to train for the priesthood
7252528 my pal chickened out but out of bravado i went through with it then stayed on for four years
7252529 eventually i decided that i preferred chasing skirt to wearing one
7252530 but it made great training for acting since both involve wearing a great costume and performing in front of a captive audience
7252531 i suppose you could also say doctor who is a religious show
7252532 hes a being from outside our world who is willing to risk his own life to save us all
7252533 i was an actor working at the roundhouse in london at the time
7252534 the rolling stones were playing there so i was asked to work the stage as a bouncer
7252535 this was in the innocent days before violence was invented
7252536 so i just danced about the stage next to the band then went for drinks with them afterwards
7252537 so no one better dive onto the stage during the mikado
7252538 or i really will be using my bouncer training to make sure that a few heads really do roll

7252544 the whole games have been great and a silver is still brilliant

7252552 either we can hand this country over to the taliban or we can fight i am going to fight

7252565 its a huge honour and a fantastic opportunity for us to shine under the international spotlight
7252566 i am sorely disappointed by the decision it was very weak of the bfc
7252567 i think the lda should pull its funding for london fashion week it is totally wrong that public money is funding something that is clearly unhealthy and i have written to the lda to tell them this
7252568 introducing those health checks would have helped in tackling the size zero issue i find it embarrassing that we are not even giving it a go unless the recommendations are actually enforced they are just gimmicky sound bites

7252577 it takes human error and human judgment out of it as far as officials running the clock they say when the nfl did it they actually gained four to five plays per game
7252578 the committee is struggling with trying to maintain a reasonable length of the game
7252579 the changes put in a couple of years ago there was such a negative reaction to them we reverted to original rules but the committee felt like there was room to improve length of the game
7252580 the national commissioners for college officials they say with the old 25 second clock they gave their guys 13 14 seconds to start the clock
7252581 the reality is the 40 second clock should not change the tempo of the game unless you choose to change it

7252583 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7252584 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7252585 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7252586 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7252587 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7252588 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7252589 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7252590 gracias al bar a estuve all porque si ellos hubiesen querido el club contaba con una resoluci n favorable del tas tendr a que haber vuelto para ac despu s de todo lo que pas poder volver con la medalla es m s lindo todav a

7252593 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7252594 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7252595 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7252596 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7252597 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7252598 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7252599 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7252600 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7252601 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7252602 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7252603 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7252604 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7252605 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7252606 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7252607 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7252608 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7252609 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7252610 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7252611 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7252612 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7252613 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7252614 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7252615 ese que usted siempre quiso ser pero la realidad no se lo permit a
7252616 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7252617 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7252618 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7252619 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7252620 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7252621 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7252622 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7252623 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7252624 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7252625 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7252626 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7252627 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7252628 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7252629 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7252630 who are open to doing something on the production side
7252631 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7252632 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7252633 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7252634 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7252635 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7252636 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7252637 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7252638 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7252639 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7252640 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7252641 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7252642 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7252643 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7252644 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7252645 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7252646 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7252647 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7252648 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7252649 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7252650 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7252651 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7252652 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7252653 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7252654 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7252655 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7252656 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7252657 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7252658 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7252659 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7252660 santacroce merita la nazionale napoli sorpresa del campionato esordio a roma sar partita tirata
7252661 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7252662 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7252663 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7252664 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7252665 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

7252685 serious fire was going on for more than 6 days we hardly left our basements i saw tanks in the city and jets dropping bombs from above it was horrible shooting innocent civilians in the 21st century we had 273 wounded in our hospital forty five people died among them were two journalists who arrived with the georgians we placed their bodies in the emergency room because we couldnt go to the morgue with all the shooting
7252686 one woman told german journalists yesterday how the georgians had stopped their car and ordered a mother and her children and everyone else out onto the road they poured gas over the woman and burned her alive right in front of her kids another mother escaped with her child but they were run over by tanks

7252795 i believe that when the called ministers of christ deal with us by his divine command in particular when they exclude openly unrepentant sinners from the christian congregation and absolve those who repent of their sins and want to do better this is just as valid and certain even in heaven as if christ our dear lord dealt with us himself
7252796 no one can say jesus is lord except in the holy spirit

7252810 now that weve learned from the la times that john mccain ditched reporters and dragged a 9 car motorcade to starbucks to snag a large cappuccino on friday i think its time for joe to let it go hell mccain was probably wearing his 500 italian loafers at the time i bet he has more than one pair and probably had a hard time deciding which home to return to
7252811 another way to put this is that if you print too much currency it devalues it the mccain campaign is cranking out all these bills with a little mccain as p o w logo on it and is trying to use them to buy their way out of every controversy that comes along pretty soon the mccain teams money wont be good anywhere

7252870 johhny johhny johhny you lost the dating argument fair and square on the science alone
7252871 we as a whole cannot date anything accurately you know it i know it other scientist know it they refuse to admit it because lord forbid if any of them are ever wrong
7252872 you lost you cant even date an eruption that we can prove in history happened
7252873 dude that whole argument smells fishy or at least squiddy they would have found them earlier if the would have gotten over their over blown egos see example above the reason no real effort to find one was scientists evos probably a few emoss as well said they couldnt possibly exist oh the high and mighty have spoken wow on there first real expedition having finally securing funds lo and behold what do they find a real live monster giant squid johnny come down off your highchair your flinging food all over and well since you think your part monkey your bound to start flinging something else whoops to late japanese fishing boats keep hauling up dinosaur carcasses
7252874 ill let mary schweitzer speak for herself and allow the people to decide flesh and blood from a 65 million year old dinosaur dragon thats still funny but you have to ask yourself why this isnt paraded around like their mighty date testing crap could be the people would see the man behind the curtain

7252877 they recently dated the new dome on top the volcano want to know how old the tests say 340 000 to 2 8 million years not only is that wrong but look at that margin not only is the error off by a multiple of 100 000 28 years 2 800 000 years but the gap between the readings is nearly 2 5 million years but that is a small camel to swallow for the camel swallowing long earth agers it has been demonstrated in the laboratory that the radiometric indicators used by evolutionists to get their great ages of the earth can be off by as much as a factor of 1 billion due to a billion fold acceleration of beta decay add to that the known errors in radiocarbon dating and you have an earth age that is dead center on the 6000 year age indicated by the genealogies in genesis and subsequent recorded histories in the tanakh so a 100 000 fold error is a small pill to swallow for these religious evolutionist nuts who have already swallowed a camel they have always gone on blind faith without any genuine bona fide evidence to support it
7252878 johnny has been as lost as a frog in a hailstorm from the very beginning of this discussion

7252888 lord i am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof but only say the word and my soul shall be healed
7252889 and the scribes and pharisees began to think saying who is this who speaketh blasphemies who can forgive sins but god alone
7252890 i saw in the night visions and behold one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven and came to the ancient of days and they brought him near before him and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all people nations and languages should serve him his dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed
7252891 and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
7252892 the lords words to the apostle peter in matthew 16 19 as to binding and to all the disciples in 18 18 signify in the former case that the apostle by his ministry of the word of life would keep unbelievers outside the kingdom of god and admit those who believed
7252893 and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved
7252894 then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about 3 000 souls
7252895 to him christ give all the prophets witness that through his christs name whosoever believeth in him christ shall receive remission of sins
7252896 for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus
7252897 depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels
7252898 god forbid yea let god be true but every man a liar
7252899 come now and let us reason together and has said in so many words herself that her eyes and ears are closed she is not ready and so we can only pray for her at this point and i have done so
7252900 there has been a historical process of expropriation of the means of production on the part of the clergy to the detriment of the christian people
7252901 the sacred power must be put back in the hands of the people
7252902 on may 13 1981 within three weeks of that private papal conference to fire arrupe john paul ii was struck by two bullets from the browning semiautomatic pistol of paid hitman mehmet ali agca by mistake as it was later explained the pontiff was rushed to the roman hospital of gemelli rather than to the special hospital unit organized solely for papal use he was given blood from the public blood bank the private supply kept in readiness was never used in rapid succession pope john paul underwent two major operations and suffered the consequences of the transfusion of impure blood he contracted a severe case of hepatitis at the height of the pontiffs crisis on may 28 cardinal wyszynski of warsaw died wyszynski was john pauls closest friend and had made his career
7252903 in some respects the meeting that convened in the middle of spring 1981 bore the marks of thousands of board meetings going on at the same moment in every daylight country of the world beyond glass paneled double doors a conference between seven men was in progress a folder bulging with reports lay in front of each man at each mans elbow a full carafe of water topped with a glass was perched anyone happening to glance in might have said that the men gathered there were absorbed in the sort of hushed but free wheeling discussion typical of board meetings everywhere but this was not the sort of meeting most people have ever witnessed or even glimpsed through shut glass paneled doors this conference room was on the third floor of the palace of the popes on vatican hill the report folders were red damask and emblazoned in gold with the tiara and keys outside the door a secretary and two swiss guards in traditional uniform were on duty to block all intruders seated at the conference table were the pontiff of the holy roman catholic church and six of his most powerful cardinals the movers and shakers of the vatican a cameo of its most formidable strength and the subject of discussion between them was the life or death of the society of jesus whether in other words the order headed by father general pedro arrupe should be allowed to go on as it was or be reorganized and reset according to the often repeated wishes of three popes or be officially done to death by the power and under the authority of pope john paul ii
7252904 a summary of this material was made generally available through the associated press which published the following short note on march 31
7252905 soon after the conclave the new pope had a talk with the 20 cardinals from latin america and was deeply impressed by the fact that most of them supported liberation theology
7252906 on the basis of paul vis critical dossier and with the help of a very experienced old jesuit father paolo dezza who had been confessor to pope paul vi and now was john paul is confessor the pope composed a hard hitting speech of warning
7252907 let it not happen that the teachings and publications of jesuits contain anything to cause confusion among the faithful
7252908 paul meanwhile was in desperate need of help of all sorts his health had been deteriorating in an operation that took place on the fourth floor of the apostolic palace in november of 1967 the pontiffs prostate gland was removed contrary to rumors there had been no metastasis more miseries of the mortal kind came from the extremely arthritic condition of pauls legs and from his cervical arthritis that last condition forced him to wear a stiff collar beneath his robes in order to lessen the pain a circumstance that saved his life during his visit to manila the kris wielded by the bolivian painter and would be papal assassin benjamin amor y mendoza was sharp enough to have severed pauls jugular veins as mendoza slashed twice once to the right and once to the left side of pauls neck had it not been for that stiff collar and the speed of pauls private secretary monsignore macchi who caught mendozas arm and slowed its force paul would have been killed as it was he was wounded slightly on both sides of the neck
7252909 again in 1590 the same pope sixtus v decided to change the name
7252910 you have to doff your hat or bow your head
7252911 if god causes you to suffer much it is a sign that he has great designs for you and that he certainly intends to make you a saint and if you wish to become a great saint entreat him yourself to give you much opportunity for suffering for there is no wood better to kindle the fire of holy love than the wood of the cross which christ used for his own great sacrifice of boundless charity
7252912 few souls understand what god would accomplish in them if they were to abandon themselves unreservedly to him and if they were to allow his grace to mold them accordingly
7252913 you think that everybody is edified with those copies of yours i dont show many of them nor do i read many of them i havent the time two letters could be made out of the 3 superfluous matter in your principal letter
7252914 look for god in all men and serve them as images of him
7252915 without the shedding of blood no man can be saved
7252916 showing absolutely no indication theyre going to stop enriching uranium
7252917 it is clear that iran doesnt pay attention to talks iran is a threat not only to israel but this is a global threat
7252918 any kind of hesitation is being perceived by the iranians as weakness
7252919 you dont even give them 15 months necessarily you think its a more urgent matter
7252920 t he world cannot afford a nuclear iran and weapons of mass destruction everywhere in this region in the hands not only of states but also of terrorist organizations
7252921 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
7252922 responsible financial institutions and businesses worldwide are taking steps to avoid doing business with iranian nuclear and missile entities as well as with the front companies and cut outs the iranian regime uses to disguise its activities
7252923 these five nuclear and missile entities have been used by iran to hide its illicit conduct and further its dangerous nuclear ambitions
7252924 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
7252925 the people who cast the votes decide nothing the people who count the votes decide everything
7252926 they are likely to use any bomb they build both because of ideology and because of fear of israeli nuclear pre emption thus an israeli nuclear strike to prevent the iranians from taking the final steps toward getting the bomb is probable the alternative is letting tehran have its bomb in either case a middle eastern nuclear holocaust would be in the cards
7252927 the issue with iran is not about uranium enrichment it wants to control the region
7252928 the reason for this is that they do not want people to panic
7252929 if there is a nuclear leak from one of irans nuclear reactors we need to have stockpiled iodine
7252930 kuwait must have emergency medical teams ready to deal with such situations who are equipped with supplies ready in all areas of kuwait who are ready to deal with every contingency
7252931 stockpile food and have alternative routes to import food into kuwait
7252932 kuwait would need to procure more trucks for this purpose
7252933 this would require oil tankers equipped to travel in shallow water during the tanker war this was done and proved to be very expensive
7252934 it was successful to maintain the flow of kuwaiti oil but expensive
7252935 powerful forces have historically attempted to control trade via this point
7252936 so they could control traffic through the gulf iran has had this intention since 1971
7252937 the maneuvers that have been carried out recently are held one after another to keep our armed forces prepared and strong fortunately these exercises have shown our great defensive capabilities to the world
7252938 security is a national issue the people expect our courageous armed forces to take even the slightest threats seriously
7252939 what we are talking about here are threats from outside the region
7252940 to all my arab brothers and sisters in neighboring countries i must say that our security is your security and your security is ours
7252941 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
7252942 reserves the right to take whatever action it deems necessary
7252943 would give iran international legitimacy for its programme which it currently lacks
7252944 the americans are not ready to allow us to attack iran
7252945 our position is that no option is to be taken off the table but in the meantime we have to make diplomatic progress
7252946 it would not be right to talk about these things
7252947 threat to the whole world order and there are many actions to be made in the realm of intelligence and preventive measures
7252948 does not see an action against iran as the right thing to do at the moment
7252949 israel supports international efforts to place pressure on the regime in tehran to cease nuclear enrichment its time for the international community to send a clear message to the iranian leadership only if diplomacy is exercised seriously will diplomacy succeed
7252950 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
7252951 the people who cast the votes decide nothing the people who count the votes decide everything
7252952 during the recent operations in basra sadr city and maysan iraqi troops uncovered convincing evidence that iranian lethal aid has continued to flow into iraq
7252953 whereas iran has proved time and again its good intention to help iraqs stabilization development and prosperity through close cooperation with the iraqi government in different fields as well as to help iraqi people overcome their immense difficulties the u s government unwarrantedly insists on its unacceptable behavior in scapegoating others including iran for its own wrong policies in iraq
7252954 the continuation of the presence of foreign forces in the country and certain wring policies and practices on the part of foreign forces there
7252955 there is a mechanism which is agreed between iraq and these countries on what these countries can do through the meeting of interior ministers of these countries through the expanded neighboring countries conferences which took place in kuwait and anther one that is going to take place in jordan in fall
7252956 we are going to continue these negotiations through diplomatic channels
7252957 we hope that any improvement in the relationship between iran and the u s will help the situation in iraq
7252958 it is noteworthy that despite these groundless allegations to date no single credible evidence has ever been presented to substantiate them
7252959 to the contrary several high ranking iraqi officials are on record stressing irans constructive role in the country and rejecting the solid allegation
7252960 the united states accuses iran because the two countries have as yet not resolved their outstanding disputes
7252961 the accusation is designed to stem irans rising regional influence which the u s itself helped to enhance by overthrowing two of the islamic republics most implacable enemies the taliban and saddam hussein regimes
7252962 in addition during these operations numerous jish al mahdi militia fighters and leaders of jish al mahdi associated highly trained special groups fled to iran where they received sanctuary
7252963 as far as the u s is concerned the accusation has the advantage of undermining irans image in the eyes of iraqi shiites by blaming iran for the nefarious activities of the discredited elements in the mahdi army
7252964 the allegations are also designed to provide credence for americas narrative that depicts iran as a deceitful untrustworthy and hypocritical power which while professing to support the central government in baghdad trains funds and arms iraqi prime minister nouri enemies
7252965 irans role in iraq is a byproduct of u s iran relations
7252966 when u s iran relations have stalled irans role in iraq would likely be unconstructive and when u s iran relations are cooperative then irans role in iraq might be cooperative it doesnt necessarily mean that the u s has to pull out from iraq
7252967 the security situation has improved not simply because of the surge but because of a host of other factors including the successful completion of ethnic cleansing in key areas and americas success in buying off former sunni insurgents
7252968 economic conditions the improving performance of the iraqi military the decision on the part of iran to lend greater support to the iraqi central government instead of shiite militias as well as blunders on the part of al qaeda and setbacks suffered by moqtada al sadr
7252969 theres ongoing cooperation between us on missile defense but theres nothing new on that
7252970 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
7252971 we will protect our land and territorial waters with all our might
7252972 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one

7252986 irans role in iraq is a by product of u s iran relations
7252987 when u s iran relations have stalled irans role in iraq would likely be unconstructive and when u s iran relations are cooperative then irans role in iraq might be cooperative it doesnt necessarily mean that the u s has to pull out from iraq

7252990 justifications and pretexts for those us and israel who want to drag the region down a dangerous slope
7252991 who didnt adequately refute claims over iraqs supposed weapons of mass destruction
7252992 israel must on no account attack iran speak of attacking iran or even think about it
7252993 belligerent measures taken by a nation to prevent passage of vessels or aircraft to and from another country customary international law recognizes blockades as an act of war because of the belligerent use of force even against third party nations in enforcing the blockade blockades as acts of war have been recognized as such in the declaration of paris of 1856 and the declaration of london of 1909 that delineate the international rules of warfare
7252994 as part of general international law and customary international law
7252995 the seizure of a french vessel is an act of hostility or reprisal requiring congressional approval the court held that congress pursuant to constitutional war powers had authorized hostilities on the high seas under certain circumstances
7252996 even an order from the president could not justify or excuse an act that violated the laws and customs of warfare chief justice john marshall wrote that a captain of a united states warship could be held personally liable in trespass for wrongfully seizing a neutral danish ship even though
7252997 the courts position seems consistent with a typical trespass case where defendants are liable even when they have a reasonable good faith but mistaken belief in authority to enter on the plaintiffs land
7252998 a blockade of coastal states that had joined the confederacy at the outset of the civil war the court explicitly ruled that a blockade is an act of war and is legal only if properly authorized under the constitution
7252999 the power of declaring war is the highest sovereign power and is limited to the representative of the full sovereignty of the nation it is limited in the united states to its congress exclusively and the authority of the president to be the commander in chief to take that the law be faithfully executed is to be taken in connection with the exclusive power given to congress to declare war and does not enable the president to do it or to introduce without act of congress war or any of its legal disabilities or liabilities on any citizen of the united states

7253007 we will be forced to react not with diplomatic but with military technical methods
7253008 we have reached a stage at which we have surrounded ourselves with more things but have less joy
7253009 we are currently working on a series of satellites that will be put into orbit within the next two years
7253010 the liberal soul shall be made fat and he that watereth shall be watered also himself

7253019 whatever happened between ash and me is over im really fond of the bachchans abhishek is a buddy and i really like him i wont have anyone speak badly about his wife
7253020 earlier ever since his breakup with aishwarya salman had been obsessing about her before all their mutual friends salman would deliberately seek out people who were close to aishwarya and endlessly ask questions about her and narrate his woeful tales about how badly she treated him there came a time when friends who knew them both started avoiding him
7253021 salman has gotten over aishwarya and is quite protective towards her he doesnt allow anyone to talk against her
7253022 he proudly tells people how jayaji used to say aishwarya looks the best on screen with salman though salman is extremely fond of the bachchans and now considers ash an integral part of that family he wont ever be paired with her professionally

7253060 when they were leaving the scene it was under the understanding that perhaps he hadnt shown the best judgment there were a number of people that took offense to the child being naked in the group and subjected to peoples scrutiny

7253071 it is the first time in europe since the cold war that a foreign army has entered the territory of a sovereign state without any internationally accepted legal basis
7253072 if we were to be ambivalent about this it would give tacit approval to put our country and our citizens under threat
7253073 it is the only way for our country to protect our national security and sovereignty when the borders of nato expand so too does the region of peace and stability
7253074 people automatically assume that if it weakens the hazards go down with it but in the case of rainfall its not a function of wind speed

7253094 i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 per cent cast iron damage proof
7253095 its not always easy to make lunchtime conversation with a mother who for decades has had international leaders and statesmen to engage with in potentially world changing discussions
7253096 but she soon became confused and a few sentences later discussion of bosnia had moved to the falklands as she muddled the falklands conflict with the yugoslav wars watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it
7253097 im in favor of another agreement whatever it takes to stop the conflict but you know it just cannot have as a tradeoff the criminals going scott free
7253098 at the half marathon i was 1 06 20 right where i wanted to be but i hit the wall at 35k i just fell apart at the end i was running about 3 45 per k where i wanted to be around 3 10 the only thing that kept me going was that this was the olympics you dont drop out in the olympics i ran with defending olympic champ stefano baldini and a russian in the middle of the race and we were picking off a lot of people but then they dropped me i started going backwards
7253099 the timing of course is simply the timing of when the agreement was completed
7253100 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
7253101 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
7253102 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats
7253103 wir konnten daher alle ausschlie en die sich nicht auf der favoritenstra e befinden und die nicht um mitternacht schlie en
7253104 die waffe hielt er dann einer kellnerin entgegen die brigens eine kollegin von uns war schrie geld und gab ihr ein plastiksackerl

7253107 fighting is still going on we hit and destroyed over 40 militants bunkers and a training camp
7253108 we have confirmed reports that 50 militants were killed while 10 of our soldiers were martyred
7253109 killed more than 130 apostates wounded more than 100 and destroyed three barracks and several vehicles
7253110 we have also called in the army to assist the police in enforcing law and order
7253111 if at all we have threats from any quarter its from indian forces
7253112 the government is unnerved by the nonviolent mass uprising and is now trying to use its old tactic to try to break the will of people
7253113 it is a particularly nasty weapon that can literally take someones head off we are very glad it is off the streets and we want more weapons handed in

7253139 there was thunderings and lightnings and a thick cloud on the mountain so moses drew near the thick darkness where god was
7253140 with moisture he saturates the thick clouds and they swirl about being turned by his guidance that they may do whatever he commands them on the face of the whole earth including new orleans he causes it to come whether for correction or for his land or for mercy
7253141 the lord has his way in the whirlwind and in the storm and the clouds are the dust of his feet
7253142 the natural man does not receive the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness to them nor can he know them because they are spiritually discerned

7253144 we are getting information that they are still in captivity but their whereabouts are unknown
7253145 we dont have any concrete informations on the kidnappers or where they have been taken but we are trying to find out how they are
7253146 some of the information we are getting so far indicates that the journalists were kidnapped by freelance militias who want a ransom
7253147 i cant say at all that we have confidence in israel
7253148 defensive weapons which are not breaking the regional balance of power
7253149 playing nicely into the hands of syria which is using it to strengthen its ties with an old and resurrected friend send messages to a traditional foe israel and pressure the united states into changing course over damascus
7253150 syrias bad negotiating position is leading it to look for more weapons and to try to grow more teeth before returning to the table with israel
7253151 both assad and hezbollah are hoping to get new weapons systems from russia and greater diplomatic backing

7253186 pictures in advertising are very expensive not in the cost of good art work alone but in the cost of space
7253187 use them pictures only when they form a better selling argument than the same amount of space set in type
7253188 picturing beautiful women admired and attractive is a supreme inducement but there is a great advantage in including a fascinated man women desire beauty largely because of men then show them using their beauty as women do use it to gain maximum effect
7253189 do nothing to merely interest amuse or attract do only that which wins the people you are after in the cheapest possible way

7253215 he was intensely focused upon accomplishing his duty but had a calm demeanor about him that put all at ease
7253216 courageous innovative full of energy and was one of the best squad leaders in the task force
7253217 william was a remarkable son and a dedicated soldier and paratrooper he had very strong convictions toward his career as a soldier they said
7253218 believed he and his unit would make a difference in fact they noted sigua had already begun making a difference in the los altos community through his written correspondence with the fifth grade class at santa rita elementary school
7253219 he and the children exchanged mail and he enjoyed helping them understand more about what we are doing to preserve freedom the children were excited by their contact with him thats the kind of effect he had on everyone siguas family said
7253220 he had an impact on everyone he met and had many friends who looked up to him and will remember him as a hero they added
7253221 come in this moment its freezing out here put down your pack brush the snow from your sleeve you should be at home on a cold christmas eve
7253222 its my duty to stand at the front of the line that separates you from the darkest of times no one had to ask or beg or implore me im proud to stand here like my fathers before me my gramps died at pearl on a day in december
7253223 i can live through the cold and the being alone away from my family my house and my home i can stand at my post through the rain and the sleet i can sleep in a foxhole with little to eat i can carry the weight of killing another or lay down my life with my sister and brother who stand at the front against any and all to ensure for all time that this flag will not fall
7253224 harbor no fright your family is waiting and ill be all right
7253225 but isnt there something i can do at the least
7253226 or prepare you a feast it seems all too little for all that youve done for being away from your wife and your son
7253227 just tell us you love us and never forget to fight for our rights back at home while were gone to stand your own watch no matter how long for when we come home either standing or dead to know you remember we fought and we bled
7253228 jennifer if i never have anything but the clothes on my back the truck i drive and a roof over my head i will be happy and grateful for those things because we are living the american dream those people over there do not value life they just dont care

7253230 wir m chten es auf einem sonntag machen und daf r gab es kaum termine im november

7253232 sia noi che i calabresi amiamo giocare rapidi e muovendo palla a terra ma abbiamo dovuto studiare e sopportare anche un terreno di gioco in cattive condizioni che ha penalizzato entrambe le squadre poi dopo la prima marcatura abbiamo sfruttato il calo motivazionale del crotone ed abbiamo meritato il passaggio del turno
7253233 ce labbiamo messa davvero tutta ma le qualit in mezzo al campo poi hanno fatto la differenza
7253234 questo ci metter alla prova per sondare le nostre capacit di reazione
7253235 la verit credo stia nel mezzo gi la partita di domenica prossima dovr essere condotta con ben altro piglio perch in ballo ci sono i tre punti e lavversario che ci troveremo davanti non dovr combattere per andare in serie a anche se il pescara comunque fortissimo io sono soddisfatto dei miei ragazzi come gi detto ma spero che in settimana arrivino altri giocatori a darci una mano con la societ si sta cercando di piazzare quattro colpi vedremo il da farsi
7253236 noi cercheremo di fare il massimo possiamo assicurarvelo ma difficile parlare di posizione di classifica perch quello che verr sar un campionato durissimo rispetto allanno scorso ci sono pi compagini attrezzate e quindi sar battaglia ogni domenica
7253237 i dont know whats worse too much rain or not enough
7253238 youre looking at two years after a drought before you would really expect to see a lot of rebuilding of the cow herd
7253239 probably only gained 10 percent to 15 percent of those back
7253240 a drought it takes at least a year to get back to normal they just grazed it down to the dirt and we didnt get our fall regrowth like we traditionally get
7253241 instead of planting a couple thousand trees i planted over 3 000 trees
7253242 that ought to catch me back up to what i lost last year
7253243 youve just got to learn to roll with what she throws at you
7253244 we store them very very carefully in the hopes that someone someday may decide that we can use them again
7253245 youd have to talk to every one of the 10 072 election jurisdictions across the country
7253246 after 2000 everyone thought you could throw a bunch of money at the problem and make it go away right away elections aint that kind of thing
7253247 there has been no evidence of any tampering on these machines

7253264 the practice of children assuming the fathers surname is traceable to the english medieval property system in which the husband controlled all marital property that preference continued in america reflecting not only the long standing english tradition but also the societal distinctions in the status of men and women until the latter part of this century the assumption that children would bear their fathers surnames was a matter of common understanding and the preference for paternal surnames was rarely challenged but the historical justifications that once supported a tradition in the law for children to bear paternal surnames have been overtaken by societys recognition of full legal equality for women an equality that is incompatible with continued recognition of a presumption that children must bear their fathers surname that presumption shall no longer apply in this state

7253313 these rat model tumors were developed from human glioblastoma tumor cells and closely mimic human tumors in growth patterns and response to therapy
7253314 the concept of targeting blood vessels that feed tumors as an approach to limit tumor growth is not a novel idea

7253346 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president

7253372 im not going to say to much about thesecond goal but from where im sitting that one was offside
7253373 i wonder if its maybe pre meditated or maybe its just me wee gus and craig levein
7253374 its an incredible decision for a linesman who is in line with the play to actually give an offside on that one
7253375 since the season started weve been hearing that the old firm get all the decisions
7253376 i can sometimes handle my managerial colleagues frustration at that aspect of it
7253377 it doesnt happen all the time and its clear it doesnt happen all the time
7253378 we got a bad one at tannadice earlier this season which has been forgotten about maybe because we dont make that much of a fuss about it same situation here
7253379 i thought we were excellent in the first half i thought we played really well with good possession of the ball
7253380 i dont think there was a great deal between the teams in the second half of the game
7253381 we certainly deserved a point i thought we were unlucky to go behind
7253382 theyre a big strong team and they were causing us problems i think we rectified that in the second half
7253383 every element of the game pushes the host hardware to its limits with mercury steam producing a game that has breath taking visuals incredible cinematic qualities and varied and engrossing gameplay it is truly an epic game but telling a human and emotive story this is a title we hope will set a new standard for action adventure titles

7253393 the president is not the action officer you bring the action to the national security adviser and people who set the table for the president to decide on policies theyre going to implement
7253394 whoa thats a startling admission im pretty certain that president bush or any president for that matter would consider himself or herself the action officer when it comes to protecting the country from terrorism
7253395 he tenet doesnt know when bush decided to go to war but he writes that in september 2002 there was no decision to go to war yet and that by december 2002 the war decision had already been made he provides no evidence or statements to support these claims and i think he is wrong about the latter date from my reporting and interviews with bush and other key players i believe bush finally decided to go to war in early january 2003
7253396 full disclosure in discussions with tenet as a reporter for this paper i many times urged him to write his memoir and after he resigned from the cia i even spent a day with him and his co writer bill harlow in late 2005 to suggest questions he should try to address foremost i hoped that he would provide intimate portraits of the two presidents he had served as cia director george w bush and bill clinton instead he has adhered to the rule of cia directors protect the president at all costs

7253427 yo fui funcionario en la administraci n anterior y precisamente pudimos aprender de las insuficiencias de los aciertos y podemos hacer las cosas de mejor modo
7253428 no son intenciones no son buenos prop sitos y discursos que de alguna manera puedan servir para orientar el quehacer sin un aterrizaje de tareas de metas espec ficas de responsables y tiempos
7253429 son cuestiones que son medibles que tienen referentes claros para saber si se han cumplido o no tienen indicadores y tienen responsables
7253430 esto parte de una visi n integral una visi n estrat gica que impulsa el se or presidente de la rep blica y que ciertamente comparten todos los actores pol ticos que tiene objetivos claros estrategias puntuales acciones espec ficas tiempos y responsables
7253431 me parece que la autoridad necesita requiere demanda de un acompa amiento ciudadano nosotros necesitamos la cr tica ciudadana y tambi n que los ciudadanos puedan verificar lo que hacemos cotidianamente tambi n para que valoren el esfuerzo que se hace nos indiquen nuestras insuficiencias y errores nos ayuden a corregirlos y tambi n nos destaquen los aciertos y esto sin duda reproduce de una manera virtuosa la capacidad de construir mejores instituciones

7253464 the determining factor was that jt had the better command of the three
7253465 this is not a case of shaun or alex not playing well
7253466 i had to ask myself would he do that to me and he has before thats the way it goes you keep talking about rivalries we might have one now

7253470 i just got blocked in behind a few cars and some cars in front of me started wrecking
7253471 i got hit from behind so we just tore the car up pretty good
7253472 i was just kind of hanging around playing solid golf and all of a sudden i saw the leaders at 12 under then back to 10 under and all of a sudden to fall back to seven under i knew they must have had a little hiccup there
7253473 i was fortunate its still early though theres plenty of golf left

7253475 to be here and be in contention in a major tournament like this its pretty cool
7253476 through 10 holes i was one under and doing okay then made two stupid plays in a row at 11 and 12
7253477 really the one at 12 was one of the dumbest plays ive ever made trying to do what i did out of the rough and i paid for it and from that point on it was a struggle to get it in
7253478 it was a little bit of a mixed bag today
7253479 obviously a couple of tee shots here and there that i would like to have hit a little better overall youve got to realize the course was playing tough and the wind was coming up and down so it was tough to pull some of the clubs

7253583 that rule is the way it is because it serves the interest of the capitalist class
7253584 the rule is that way because that is the efficient rule and common law adjudication selects for efficient rules
7253585 because such and such a rule functions in thus and so way
7253586 the law is such and such because that rule serves the interest of the capitalist class
7253587 feudal law governing rights in land gave way to modern property law with free alienability because that change was required by the transition from the feudal mode of production to the capitalist mode of production

7253595 but right now i dont feel happy with the result
7253596 ok i have a medal around my neck but when you go out losing after this run we made its really disappointing
7253597 and they made us look bad on defense and our defense all tournament long has been great thats just a compliment to how good that team is theyve got a lot of great shooters theyre well coached theyve got the athletes and they beat us good today
7253598 merrill got us to this game and he played great in the tournament but we gave up six goals in the first quarter and 10 goals by the time we were able to get merrill out
7253599 we prepared for it but some days it isnt your day
7253600 im happy the coaches got brandon in there to see if they could make a difference thats the whole thing this is a team they just kept coming at us but im proud of how we played
7253601 you never want to get in a scoring battle with the hungarians because theyre such great shooters
7253602 we wanted to make it a defensive game and we just didnt get it done
7253603 they were hitting shots they were making tough shots and it starts kind of steamrolling on you
7253604 the united states of america is not going to win a shootout with the best shooters in the world
7253605 we really stepped up together no one quit finally terry arrived and our only goal was to be on the podium my proudest moment was every single one of us dying for each other

7253651 shaping the future of occupational medicine finding opportunities for collaboration
7253652 in this paper we use the word disability the same way that employers use it in their benefits programs and employment policies and the same way that insurance laws regulations and policies do we use disabled to mean someone who is absent from work or not working at full productive capacity for reasons related to a medical condition please note that confusion is common regarding the word disability since it is sometimes used to describe physical or functional impairments for example a person who has an impairment that affects one or more life functions is considered to have a disability under the americans with disabilities act ada however people with ada qualifying impairments who are working at full productive capacity would not be considered disabled according to our definition because they are at work
7253653 the focus of this paper is on the surprisingly large number of people who end up with prolonged or permanent withdrawal from work due to medical conditions that normally would cause only a few days of work absence
7253654 on the other hand many of the people who receive disability benefits have severe illnesses like a major cancer or schizophrenia or have suffered catastrophic injuries such as amputations blinding major burns or spinal cord injuries or have had major surgery
7253655 we contend that a considerable amount of the work disability due to common everyday conditions and an unknown fraction of the disability that follows more serious conditions is avoidable as are its social and economic consequences we believe that a lot of work disability can be prevented or reduced by finding new ways of handling important non medical factors that are fueling its growth
7253656 gee thats so cool i wish i could do that

7254290 he was always threatening to kill me with a pump action shotgun

7254292 i had stopped smoking cigarettes drinking booze and taking drugs but i stopped them cold never went to a 12 step program or anything like that to deal with it instead i replaced those addictions with a stealing addiction
7254293 the judge had ordered me to pay a 60 000 fine and be on probation for two years
7254294 but i said if i lose the store i wont be able to pay you anything

7254299 they have a lot of gold with gold spokes and spinners in the middle

7254301 i am always waiting for that hand to go up in the audience saying could you tell us about that time you were arrested for a felony for you know hot hubcaps i always do
7254302 i told my customers a week or two ago they were all so depressed
7254303 ive always had the most fascinating customers theyll tell you anything because the relationship is brief and anonymous
7254304 if you go back 20 or more years hubcaps were made of high quality materials stamped metal not plastic they had intricate carvings emblems wreaths crests coats of arms brilliant colors colors you cant have with plastic
7254305 its sad to say goodbye to all this ive cried a lot but ive also had a lot of fun with this thing i dont wear a suit to the office and ive gotten to act out and look weird hubcaps have made me a star
7254306 ive never experienced myself or other people from such a feeling of peace ease and subdued reactivity

7254319 i thought i had nothing to lose so with my last ounce of strength i stretched out my neck and bit those babies just as hard as i could

7254330 its accuracy in distinguishing actual or potential security violators from innocent test takers is insufficient to justify reliance on its use in employee security screening in federal agencies
7254331 polygraph testing as currently used has extremely serious limitations in such screening applications if the intent is both to identify security risks and protect valued employees
7254332 right now the polygraph is the best tool they have at their hands but its not a tool thats without problems

7254374 when we talk about the homeless we are for the most part talking about addicts people who have turned to some drug to sedate the pain of life many of them have just lost their way
7254375 these folks are addicts and if they are high there is nothing they wont do
7254376 there are no throwaway people and addiction cannot be solved by passing out welfare checks or by entitlement programs
7254377 initially malware was created to wreak havoc and cause disruption for purposes of notoriety but over time it has evolved into a stealthy malicious threat leveraged by criminals for financial gain
7254378 as a result of this paradigm shift there are currently tens of thousands of live web sites that misuse brands and trademarks for purposes of malware distribution cyveillance stays ahead of the curve by taking an intelligence led approach to security proactively monitoring and identifying specific instances of online brand abuse

7254394 we know from the old days 50 to 100 years ago that people who were less well off actually did better
7254395 they were working as laborers they ate rice and beans and they couldnt afford cigarettes
7254396 short term changes in pollution have been tied to heart attacks
7254397 the first thing is awareness that not everything good times and good health goes in the same direction
7254398 its an individual thing you can control some of it
7254399 risky activities such as driving increase in good economic times
7254400 when there are stressful times some people will respond by drinking more as a way of coping
7254401 if we actually played our cards right put bike racks all over the city helped people be more physically active we could mobilize this economic downturn for the country and make it good for the heart
7254402 one of the things theyll tell you is to eat well and exercise and if you feel better physically youll feel better mentally
7254403 one of the possible things going on is that when times are bad people are actively doing those things to protect their health
7254404 i think the evidence is that the net effect of a bad economy is that health gets worse
7254405 they come to work every day they drink less because they dont want to be absent
7254406 often i ask people what kind of help do you need they answer everything
7254407 those numbers are unheard of there are people living in campgrounds theyre doubled up or theyre living in the woods its scary
7254408 do you see this this is what men do to you
7254409 it was 4 a m she kicked me and said your mothers dead she made me go to school the next day

7254430 i was faster in the exchanges but i could have won more convincingly
7254431 jag t nker g ra ditt liv till ett helvete
7254432 its one of the very few newsletters i actually read every time
7254433 with your wisdom and your understanding you have gained riches for yourself and gathered gold and silver into your treasuries by your great wisdom in trade you have increased your riches and your heart is lifted up because of your riches
7254434 he who trusts in his own heart is a fool but whoever walks wisely will be delivered
7254435 and what does the lord require of you to act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your god
7254436 in the single conversation christ had with zacchaeus brennan reminded us
7254437 manning went on to speak of the great danger of a harsh word the power of unlove to deteriorate a persons heart and spirit and how as representatives of the grace and love of god our communication should be seasoned with love and compassion
7254438 let the word of christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to the lord
7254439 keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life put away from thee a froward mouth and perverse lips put far from thee
7254440 for we know him who said vengeance is mine i will repay says the lord and again the lord will judge his people
7254441 to me belongeth vengeance and recompence their foot shall slide in due time for the day of their calamity is at hand and the things that shall come upon them make haste for the lord shall judge his people and repent himself for his servants when he seeth that their power is gone and there is none shut up or left
7254442 for i know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves and turn aside from the way which i have commanded you and evil will befall you in the latter days because ye will do evil in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands
7254443 trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths
7254444 thou hast a mighty arm strong is thy hand and high is thy right hand
7254445 though these three men noah daniel and job were in it they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness saith the lord god
7254446 though these three men were in it as i live saith the lord god they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters they only shall be delivered but the land shall be desolate
7254447 though these three men were in it as i live saith the lord god they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters but they only shall be delivered themselves
7254448 though noah daniel and job were in it as i live saith the lord god they shall deliver neither son nor daughter they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness
7254449 and it was so when the days of their feasting were gone about that job sent and sanctified them and rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all for job said it may be that my sons have sinned and cursed god in their hearts thus did job continually
7254450 i make a decree that in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the god of daniel for he is the living god and stedfast for ever and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed and his dominion shall be even unto the end
7254451 and he said oh let not the lord be angry and i will speak yet but this once peradventure ten shall be found there and he said i will not destroy it for tens sake
7254452 and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise god having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect
7254453 have mercy on us o lord have mercy on us for we are exceedingly filled with contempt our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorn of those who are at ease with the contempt of the proud
7254454 nous devons acc l rer notre travail pour obtenir ladh sion au syst me g n ral europ en de s curit et renforcer le potentiel de d fense de notre pays
7254455 tous ceux qui se soucient de lukraine doivent le dire ouvertement lentr e dans le syst me de s curit euro atlantique est le seul moyen de prot ger la vie et le bien tre de nos familles de nos enfants et petits enfants
7254456 lukraine fera tout pour ne permettre aucune escalade de la force dans notre r gion

7254458 le premier ministre pense que la parade militaire est inappropri e alors que lukraine doit faire face aux s v res inondations et parce que montrer ses muscles est une provocation
7254459 therefore leaving the discussion of the elementary principles of christ let us go on to perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward god of the doctrine of baptisms of laying on of hands of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgement and this we will do if god permits
7254460 therefore if food makes my brother stumble i will never again eat meat lest i make my brother stumble
7254461 you have ministered to the saints and do minister and we desire that each one of you show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unitl the end that you do not become sluggish but imitate those who through faith and patience inherit the promises
7254462 as i live says the lord god neither your sister sodom nor her daughters have done as you and your daughters have done look this was the iniquity of your sister sodom
7254463 and he said to me have you seen this o son of man turn again you will see greater abominations that they are doing so he brought me to the door of the north gate of the lords house and to my dismay women were sitting there weeping for tammuz
7254464 for i determined not to know any thing among you save jesus christ and him crucified
7254465 and this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent
7254466 casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the
7254467 that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him
7254468 till we all come in the unity of the faith and of
7254469 wherefore take unto you the whole armour of god that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand
7254470 when outsiders who have never heard of gods law follow it more or less by instinct they confirm its truth by their obedience they show that gods law is not something alien imposed on us from without but woven into the very fabric of our creation there is something deep within them that echoes gods yes and no right and wrong
7254471 for harvard neuroscientist marc hauser the moral dilemma experiment is evidence the brain may be hard wired for morality most moral intuitions he said are unconscious involuntary and universal to test the idea he gathered data from thousands of people in hundreds of countries all of whom display a remarkable unanimity in their basic moral choices a shared innate capacity for morality may be responsible he concluded

7254478 we must speed up our work to achieve membership of the european system of security and raise the defence capabilities of the country
7254479 only these steps will guarantee our security and the integrity of our borders
7254480 ukraine condemns any attempts to undermine the current world order and its democratic values we condemn acts of forceful intervention and aggression
7254481 we are well aware of the threats that are emerging more and more acutely in our region
7254482 our countries are linked by years of spiritual cultural and historical ties i believe the main task now is not to allow this precious asset which we inherited from past generations to be wasted

7254487 there is bound to be a lot of horse trading between mutambaras guys and zanu pf more than with tsvangirais guys
7254488 alliance or coalition in return for some deal or agreement
7254489 cannot solve the crisis of legitimacy in the country and without that its just some kind of some shadow boxing
7254490 since none of the three parties has control of the house parliament it is important that we work together to come up with one candidate
7254491 will be pushing for own candidate unless there is a compromise from the other two parties
7254492 it was however one of the tasks of the inter party dialogue to settle for a single candidate in view of the fact that no single party can achieve that without the support of the other party

7254509 you may think that gods are the ones who give you benefits and demons cause damage but it may be the other way round those who cause pain teach you to be patient and those who give you presents may keep you from practicing the dharma so it depends on their effect on you if they are gods or demons

7254511 veel kinderen komen op een verkeerde school terecht omdat iq testen het schooltype bepalen zei de maker van zon test een week geleden onder psychologen en scholen bestaat irritatie over de schijnzekerheid van het iq het ministerie van onderwijs schrijft voor dat het iq van een kind bepaalt of het straks na de basisschool extra zorg nodig heeft dat betekent wie een iq heeft van 55 tot en met 80 punten moet naar het praktijkonderwijs dat zijn aparte scholen waar leerlingen alleen praktische vaardigheden leren zoals koken omgaan met mensen of formulieren invullen bij een score tussen de 75 en 90 punten moet de leerling naar het leerwegondersteunend onderwijs in het voorbereidend middelbaar beroepsonderwijs vmbo scholieren volgen het gewone lesprogramma maar krijgen van de school extra begeleiding om het te kunnen bijbenen een week geleden sloeg dr peter tellegen psycholoog en maker van twee van de vijf toegestane intelligentietesten in het nrc alarm het circus rondom het testen van leerlingen zei hij is volledig doorgeslagen de testen die hij maakt worden volgens hem ten onrechte als waterscheiding tussen onderwijsvormen daardoor komen nu kinderen in het praktijkonderwijs die daar helemaal niet thuishoren aldus tellegen als een kind daar terechtkomt is het over het algemeen heel moeilijk daar weer uit te komen sinds de invoering van het vmbo in 1999 speelt het iq een cruciale rol bij het bepalen van het schooltype voor moeilijk lerende kinderen staatssecretaris netelenbos pvda onderwijs wilde het aantal kinderen in het speciaal onderwijs terugdringen die konden beter integreren in het regulier onderwijs voor leerlingen die echt niet het niveau van het vmbo aankunnen is het praktijkonderwijs bedacht een iq score zou objectief meten welke leerling waar thuishoort het ministerie van onderwijs wil niet reageren op de kritiek op het gebruik van iq testen toch is het ministerie van onderwijs bekend met de onnauwkeurigheid van deze testen al in 2002 zei toenmalig staatssecretaris adelmund pvda onderwijs in de tweede kamer dat ze eens wilde doorpraten over dit gevoelige onderwerp degenen die sociale studies hebben gevolgd weten hoe een iq test werkt de ene dag is er een andere uitslag dan twee weken later als je op tijd naar bed bent geweest en een boekje hebt doorgeploegd het onderwerp is nooit meer ter sprake gekomen in het parlement

7254515 politics seems to make strange bedfellows from time to time and biden has certainly been one of the strongest critics against obama during the primary season

7254529 those who dont know history are condemned to repeat it in writing
7254530 i dont think we should refuse to read old classic works but we must recognise that theyre historical documents and add that caveat to any such recommendations or commentary further modern sf readers shouldnt need to be aware of everything which has gone before but modern sf writers certainly ought to
7254531 heres this really old out of date badly written idea based historical document billy not only must you read it but you must hate it later well have milk and cookies while i read you a modern sf tale with wonderfully written sentences in it
7254532 veel muzikanten en labels tasten vaak nog in het duister als het gaat om auteursrecht en dat terwijl het zon belangrijk aspect is binnen de muziekindustrie
7254533 zeker nu er amerikaanse toestanden ontstaan waarbij mensen worden aangeklaagd voor illegaal downloaden is het belangrijk om stil te staan bij de impact van dit soort acties
7254534 als muzikant kan het toch niet zo zijn dat je ermee instemt dat je fans aanklaagt worden we willen graag muzikanten bewust maken van alternatieven voor het auteursrechtelijk beschermen van hun muziek centraal daarbij staat de balans tussen muzikant en muziekliefhebber
7254535 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del
7254536 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
7254537 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7254538 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7254539 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7254540 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre

7254545 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7254546 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7254547 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7254548 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos

7254556 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7254557 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas

7254563 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7254564 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7254565 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7254566 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7254567 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7254568 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7254569 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7254570 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano

7254595 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7254596 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto

7254604 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
7254605 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7254606 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
7254607 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7254608 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7254609 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7254610 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7254611 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7254612 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7254613 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7254614 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii

7254617 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
7254618 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
7254619 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
7254620 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente

7254624 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7254625 we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7254626 we are feeling the impacts of global economic factors beyond the control of any one individual or government
7254627 while over the course of the year we are projecting positive economic growth the outlook for real gdp growth in canada based on private sector forecasts has been revised down to 1 1 per cent in 2008 from 1 7 per cent in the budget projection
7254628 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7254629 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7254630 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7254631 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7254632 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7254633 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7254634 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7254635 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7254636 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7254637 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7254638 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7254639 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7254640 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7254641 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7254642 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7254643 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7254644 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure
7254645 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7254646 we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7254647 general opinion in the party is in favor of parting ways
7254648 i am also willing to contest the presidential election but i am bound to obey what the party decides
7254649 it might work to my advantage that so many players are out of the team
7254650 we have a lot of players out just now and when we are short of numbers you need to take your opportunities
7254651 there is so much quality in the squad we all know if you do not perform the manager will have you straight out of the team
7254652 but as we have seen plenty of times before the manager will stick by you if you do the job he needs
7254653 i have got into a lot more goalscoring opportunities during pre season but didnt manage to score
7254654 but the mere fact i was getting into the right positions was a good sign
7254655 you are at this club to play in big matches
7254656 that is what you fight every day in training for you want to try and improve and you achieve that by pitting yourself against the best
7254657 because of the draw against newcastle we need to get a win as soon as possible
7254658 but it is not going to be easy you dont get many harder games than a trip to fratton park we have had some poor results down there over the past few years
7254659 it is something we are looking to rectify because we have a run of three away games around the super cup and internationals
7254660 will man wissen was die vp f r sterreich nach der wahl wirklich vor hat gilt es aufmerksam zuzuh ren was im weltanschauungs forum alpbach verlautbart wird genau dort hat wilhelm molterer k rzlich verk ndet der staat solle sich in den bereichen gesundheit bildung und pflege auf seine grundaufgaben zur ckziehen die sterreicherinnen und sterreicher wissen seit den tagen von wolfgang sch ssel und karl heinz grasser nur allzu gut was das bedeutet einerseits die aufk ndigung der solidarischen finanzierung des gesundheitssystems und dessen privatisierung und andererseits die weitere elitisierung und abschottung des bildungsbereichs der neoliberale ungeist der die weltwirtschaft in die krise gest rzt hat steht nach wie ganz oben auf der agenda der vp
7254661 zu welchen ausw chsen ein privatisiertes gesundheitssystem f hrt l sst sich anhand der usa nachvollziehen w nscht sich molterer etwa amerikanische zust nde bei uns auf jeden fall richtet sich eine solche politik direkt gegen die interessen der menschen diese w nschen die sicherung und weiteren ausbau unseres gesundheitssystems nicht leistungsverschlechterungen und finanziellen mehraufwand dass die vp in fahrl ssiger weise die gesundheitsreform platzen lie ist nur ein weiterer beleg f r die absichten der volkspartei
7254662 und wenn molterer eine st rkere verschr nkung von universit ren und privaten initiativen im bildungsbereich fordert und man sich gleichzeitig den letzten universit tsgesetzentwurf von minister hahn vergegenw rtigt dann besteht auch hier kein zweifel dass die vp den neoliberalen umbau des bildungssystems vorantreiben will
7254663 tarnen und t uschen hat keinen zweck die sterreicherinnen und sterreicher wollen ein solidarisches gesundheitssystem und bildung f r alle statt privilegien f r einige wenige die sich alles leisten k nnen
7254664 i had to ground my pristine teenage daughter for sneaking out to the drive through with some guy named biff
7254665 stuff like this has always been a problem in the midwest and palmdale but never here
7254666 the whole of the worlds eyes will be on london in four years time so we want to kick off our olympic adventure in style in cumbria
7254667 the olympics bring people together and more than anything promote progress in countries
7254668 find me anything else that does it more tell me anything
7254669 we are going to remember these games because china is opening up it began slowly and is now opening up fast because of the olympic games and will continue fast in a way more towards solving the issues of this region of the world
7254670 you dont go and talk about how you dont like the furniture or food the politicians can make statements one way or the other
7254671 i think those outsiders who dont know much about china have to go there for themselves
7254672 you have to go see it you have to breathe it
7254673 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

7254675 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7254676 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7254677 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7254678 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7254679 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7254680 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7254681 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7254682 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7254683 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7254684 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7254685 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7254686 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7254687 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7254688 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7254689 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7254690 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7254691 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7254692 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7254693 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

7254702 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7254703 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7254704 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7254705 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7254706 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7254707 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7254708 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7254709 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7254710 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7254711 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7254712 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7254713 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7254714 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7254715 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7254716 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7254717 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7254718 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7254719 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7254720 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7254721 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7254722 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7254723 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7254724 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7254725 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7254726 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7254727 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7254728 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7254729 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7254730 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7254731 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7254732 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7254733 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7254734 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7254735 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7254736 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7254737 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7254738 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7254739 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7254740 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7254741 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7254742 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7254743 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7254744 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7254745 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7254746 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7254747 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7254748 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7254749 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7254750 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7254751 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7254752 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

7254756 i need to buy top players to challenge the top teams and that costs big money
7254757 im going to try to do something but i cant say for sure it is going to happen this is the first summer where i feel i have not made any progression
7254758 i dont need to buy mid premier league players i need top players
7254759 weve got these injuries and i want to sign six or seven players before next week
7254760 it was an excellent performance by them after a difficult time last week
7254761 west brom were much better than us in the first half and it was maybe a little unfortunate they didnt get a goal
7254762 i thought it was a cracking game a smashing game we are a little disappointed with some of the goals we have conceded but it was a fantastic result for us
7254763 villa are a top six or seven side they have got some excellent players and they cause you some problems
7254764 carew is a fantastic target man but then they have good pace and good ability around him so they have all the armour to be a decent side and they are so it was a great result for us
7254765 i think one or two things have happened that happened last week and we have to make sure mentally more than anything else that we are switched on

7254813 spot us would give a new sense of editorial power to the public
7254814 im not bill and melinda gates but i can give 10 this is the obama model this is the howard dean model
7254815 journalism that shines a light on exploitation of the weak by the strong and on the failures of those with power to vindicate the trust placed in them
7254816 were at a point now where nobody actually knows where the money is going to come from for editorial goods in the future my own feeling is that we need to try lots of things most of them wont work youll have a lot of failure but we need to launch a lot of boats

7254821 papa zu verlieren war schrecklich f r mama nicht zuletzt weil sie wegen ihrer demenz immer wieder verga dass er tot war
7254822 jedes mal wenn sie schlie lich begriff dass sie ihren ehemann verloren hatte schaute sie mich traurig an und sagte oh w hrend ich versuchte die fassung zu wahren

7254837 there are a couple of residences we spend any significant amount of time in but we own several investment properties as well and im not sure of the current number right now
7254838 the law in its majestic equality forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges to beg in the streets and to steal bread
7254839 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7254840 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7254841 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7254842 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7254843 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7254844 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7254845 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7254846 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7254847 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7254848 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7254849 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7254850 but i think we should clarify something before we proceed i assume you know that im gay and generally specialize in gay clients
7254851 i mention this only because it is an issue for some people and i dont want there to be any misunderstandings or awkwardness between my clients and me
7254852 my business here has nothing whatever directly to do with anyones sexual orientation i was simply told you were very good at getting information
7254853 i was wondering if youd like to join me for dinner
7254854 and please dont not trying to come on to you its just that we have a mutual friend whom im meeting for dinner this evening and i thought you might like to join us i know hes looking forward to seeing you
7254855 seven thirty then at napoleon you know it dont you
7254856 actually i made the reservations for eight oclock to give us a few minutes to get to know one another
7254857 but i so seldom have the chance to just relax its nice to be among kindred spirits when i can
7254858 fifteen years three kids a different world and a totally separate world
7254859 when im in the straight world im straight when im in the gay world im not straight obviously most of my life is strictly heterosexual but ive always enjoyed the things gay men can do that women cant
7254860 i get to travel quite a bit and when i do i like to indulge myself a little
7254861 i think i was five before i was absolutely sure
7254862 i think i can brush the stains from the inside of my coat but the shirt is ruined
7254863 my best shirt only fit for handkerchiefs god damn him
7254864 by god sir you might be his latest victim but you are not his seen how he treats the men
7254865 they run about furiously to look active but achieve nothing i believe hes afraid of them but the more he tries to grind them down the more just cause he has to be afraid
7254866 it looks painful for all love sir lie down ill swab the floor
7254867 you seem seaman like and efficient to me bright enough able to charm or daunt the men at will and well able to command what keeps you from passing for lieutenant you cannot want to be a midshipman all your life
7254868 on this ship you if anyone should know what its like by now i only wish id never been made acting lieutenant at all it was that that made him notice me and god knows how itll end
7254869 im not totally without ambition were i out of his reach id qualify tomorrow but that isnt going to happen now is it so i wish i had damn well kept my head down and stayed unobserved and unimportant til i died
7254870 it is a far worse pain than the stripes to me
7254871 to see so many excellent things go to waste this is a beautiful ship yet he makes her feel like a prison transport in the right hands this crew could be the equal of any in the fleet and he treats them like dumb brutes officers and men alike and you there are times i see a fine spirit in you a fighting spirit then of a sudden it fails has he broken you too is there nothing left that can be salvaged
7254872 i have been hoping to uphold the present regime at least long enough for us to reach our destination but now i wonder could i call him out
7254873 summersgill practically suggested it hed back me if i chose to i think
7254874 challenge captain walker to a duel on his own quarterdeck
7254875 on land it would wear well enough the world understands that a gentleman cannot be expected to bear such an insult
7254876 some other reason would have to be concocted and then i should need to be convinced that every man on board would be prepared to swear to the lie
7254877 you would not be so quick to trust me if you knew what i was
7254878 if i place my life in your hands will it be safe there
7254879 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7254880 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7254881 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7254882 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7254883 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7254884 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7254885 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7254886 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7254887 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7254888 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7254889 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7254890 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7254891 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7254892 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7254893 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7254894 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7254895 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7254896 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7254897 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7254898 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7254899 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7254900 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7254901 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7254902 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7254903 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7254904 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7254905 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7254906 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7254907 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7254908 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7254909 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7254910 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7254911 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7254912 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7254913 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7254914 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7254915 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7254916 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7254917 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7254918 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7254919 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7254920 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7254921 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7254922 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7254923 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7254924 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7254925 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7254926 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7254927 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7254928 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7254929 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7254930 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7254931 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7254932 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7254933 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7254934 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7254935 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7254936 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7254937 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7254938 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7254939 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7254940 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7254941 this is a planning took where all things are going
7254942 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7254943 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7254944 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7254945 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7254946 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7254947 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7254948 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7254949 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7254950 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7254951 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7254952 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7254953 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7254954 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7254955 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7254956 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7254957 peccato per leliminazione i ragazzi hanno giocato molto bene nonostante ci trovassimo di fronte ad una squadra di categoria superiore non abbiamo mai corso seri pericoli e sono convinto che se avessimo raggiunto il pareggio non avremmo rubato nulla ma questo
7254958 if rock n roll is illegal throw me in jail
7254959 yep darling just plant weed haul wood chips manure leaves and compost all your life and youll have food to eat
7254960 are you kidding me i have two sacks of dog food in the back of my truck thatd get stolen in this scarey trailer park if i went inside
7254961 men maleness and fatherhood have been under siege in american culture for decades
7254962 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7254963 if a new president and congress consider changes to the drug benefit it will be important to keep in mind that the coverage gap has consequences for some patients with serious health conditions
7254964 the experience was truly a wake up call to us
7254965 we learned that we cant be content to sit back and be happy with ourselves we are seeing a tremendous genuineness and a willingness to get involved at a level ive never seen before
7254966 if we could get to 250 by the end of the year i would be phenomenally happy
7254967 people are volunteering theres a new spirit but where was that spirit when sharon austin was here
7254968 i guess we will never know whether race was a factor but it would provide a sense of closure if we could have a conversation about it
7254969 everyone is more open they really want to grow the church you can feel god moving again
7254970 the hospital was not equipped for cell phone use so you felt like you were completely out of touch
7254971 council member chuck dicomo started to talk about a resource center and as soon as he mentioned it i said that is exactly what this hospital needs
7254972 we decided the first thing we have to do is figure out where we are going to have this place so we went searching through the hospital through all the nooks and crannies
7254973 this is a very special place for patients and families
7254974 medicine is not just about science healing is about making sure that we provide not only great clinical care but also provide an environment that allows patients and families to be able to work together to create the energy that helps people heal
7254975 its going to allow people to come here and connect with their family outside this building
7254976 if people just want to get away and they want to have a quiet place away from the patients floor away from the hustle and bustle of the nursing unit they can come here and get a little bit of respite
7254977 if a new president and congress consider changes to the drug benefit it will be important to keep in mind that the coverage gap has consequences for some patients with serious health conditions
7254978 its great to be here on the steps of the old state house in the land of lincoln
7254979 folks barack and i come from very different places but we share a common story americas story
7254980 i was different i was an irish catholic kid from scranton with a father who like many of you in tough economic times fell on hard times
7254981 my mom and dad raised me to believe its a saying barack youve heard me say it before and that my father repeated and repeated the test is not about how many times you get knocked down its how quickly you get up its how quickly you get up
7254982 ladies and gentlemen thats your story thats americas story its about if you get up to make it thats the america barack obama and i believe in thats the american dream
7254983 ladies and gentlemen these are no ordinary times and this is no ordinary election
7254984 you know ladies and gentlemen it is not a mere political saying i say with every fiber of my being i believe we cannot as a nation stand four more years of this
7254985 we cannot afford to keep giving tax cuts after tax cuts to big corporations and the wealthiest americans while middle class america middle class families are falling behind and their wages are actually shrinking
7254986 we cant afford four more years of a government that does nothing while they watch the housing market collapse
7254987 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen is like mine you sit there at night before you put the kids after you put the kids to bed and you talk about what you need you talk about how much youre worried about being able to pay the bills
7254988 well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7254989 folks again its not political sloganry when i say we literally cant afford four more years of this non energy policy written by and for the oil companies making us more and more dependent on hostile nations for our ability to run this country
7254990 ladies and gentlemen thats the bad news but there is good news for america we dont have to have four more years of george w bush and john mccain
7254991 the next president of the united states is going to be delivered to the most significant moment in american history since franklin roosevelt was elected president he will have such an incredible opportunity not only to change the direction of america but to change the direction of the world
7254992 barack obama and i believe with every fiber of our beings in our families and in our communities that as americans there is not a single solitary challenge we cannot face if we level with the american people
7254993 and i dont say that to say it history history has shown when have americans ever ever ever ever ever let their country down when theyve had a leader to lead them
7254994 ladies and gentlemen we believe that our tomorrows will bring better than our yesterdays and we believe well pass on to our children an even better life than the one we live
7254995 in all my time in the united states senate i want you to know there are only four senators senior than me barack but 44 are older i want you to know that
7254996 with all kidding aside in all my years in the senate i have never in my life seen washington so broken
7254997 the reality is we must answer the call or we will risk the harshest version and verdict of history these times call for a total change in washington these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
7254998 ill say straight up that john mccain is genuinely a friend of mine
7254999 you cant change america when you supported george bushs policy 95 percent of the time
7255000 you cant change america and give our workers a fighting chance when after losing 3 million manufacturing jobs you continue to support tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas
7255001 you cant change america and end the war in iraq and say these are his words no one has supported president bush more than i have
7255002 you cant change america you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of bushs presidency
7255003 you learn a lot about a man when you campaign with him when you debate him 12 or 10 times when you hear him speak when you watch how he reacts under pressure you learn about his strength of mind and i think more importantly the quality of his heart
7255004 ladies and gentleman no one knows better than i do when presidential campaigns are crucibles in which youre tested and challenged every single day and over the past 18 months ive watched barack meet those challenges with judgments intelligence and steel in his spine
7255005 ive watched as hes inspired millions of americans to this new cause
7255006 and during those 18 months i must tell you my friends ive been disappointed my friend john mccain gave into the right wing of his party and yielded to the swift boat politics that he himself once so deplored
7255007 campaigns for president are a test of character and leadership and in this campaign one candidate one candidate has passed that test
7255008 barack has the vision and you cant forget that vision he also has the courage to make this a better place and let me tell you something else this man is a clear eyed pragmatist who will get the job done
7255009 i watched in amazement when he came to the senate i watched in amazement
7255010 i was proudest i was proudest when i watched him spontaneously focus the attention of the nation on the shameful neglect of wounded solders at walter reed army hospital
7255011 ladies and gentleman i know im told i talk too colloquially but there is something about this guy there is something about barack obama that allows him to bring people together like no one ive worked with or seen
7255012 its been amazing to watch him but then again thats been the story of his whole life
7255013 i emphasize again this is a man raised by his single mother who sometimes was on food stamps as she worked to put herself through school
7255014 ladies and gentlemen these remarkable people gave barack obama the determination and drive and yes the boundaries to turn down that big job on wall street to come to chicagos southside where he helped workers help themselves after the steel mills had been shut down and the jobs disappeared
7255015 ladies and gentleman my wife jill who youll meet soon is drop dead gorgeous she also has a doctors degree which is a problem but all kidding aside my jill my jill my wife and i are thrilled to join barack and michelle on this journey the second leg of this journey
7255016 ladies and gentleman im here for their future im here for the future of your kids im here for everyone i grew up with in scranton pa
7255017 folks these are no ordinary times and this is no ordinary election this may be the last chance we have to reclaim the america we love to restore americas soul
7255018 ladies and gentleman america gave jill and me our chance gave barack and michelle their chance to stand on this stage today its literally incredible
7255019 he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7255020 the american dream under eight years of bush and mccain that american dream is slipping away
7255021 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver
7255022 no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have
7255023 support tax breaks for companies who ship our jobs overseas
7255024 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7255025 ive been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swift boat politics that he once so deplored
7255026 folks campaigns for presidents are a test of character and leadership
7255027 thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7255028 of course senator biden is comfortable on the attack he spent the entire primary highlighting barack obamas inexperience and failed judgment on national security
7255029 if a new president and congress consider changes to the drug benefit it will be important to keep in mind that the coverage gap has consequences for some patients with serious health conditions

7255055 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7255056 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7255057 most people feel that if she wanted to press to be vice president she would have made a bigger push for it
7255058 its going to be very different from the opening ceremony which was burdened with heavy responsibility to show chinese culture to the world

7255313 maybe more like series 5 or 6 thats the best part about the series i never really know when something is going to pop in and want to show its face
7255314 its going to directly deal with something that came up in the first series almost immediately without a break its going to deal with something that has to be dealt with right now youre going to learn some truth about some things that were said in series 1 and youre going to see the actual story of what happened
7255315 gabriel ba has done a teaser image its a really powerful image im very excited for people to see it that will really fill in readers on what the series is going to be about
7255316 change we need after eight years of failed policies that favored special interests at the expense of our families under george bush and john mccain
7255317 joe biden is the genuine article who has brought change to washington without being changed by washington
7255318 theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun and a verb and 9 11 i mean theres nothing else
7255319 get your man in line in the house if this comes out of the senate
7255320 he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at

7255326 ive been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swift boat politics that he once so deplored
7255327 folks campaigns for presidents are a test of character and leadership
7255328 thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7255329 of course senator biden is comfortable on the attack he spent the entire primary highlighting barack obamas inexperience and failed judgment on national security
7255330 this convention is probably more important than any recent convention in terms of introducing the nominee to the american people
7255331 in the past the nominees have been fairly well known or of the type thats not so rare as barack obama
7255332 get people to visualize barack obama as president its something that particularly older americans are having a real problem grappling with
7255333 by giving the clintons speaking roles obama is trying to bring in whatever constituency they have

7255357 she was sat in row 6 right at the point where the plane broke in two and thats what saved her life
7255358 she was thrown out of the gap where the plane ripped apart and landed in a stream because she landed in water she has none of the terrible burns most of the other survivors had
7255359 we cannot believe how lucky she is to be alive amazingly she looks like she could have just survived a really bad bicycle crash
7255360 she was in a great deal of pain so they have sedated her with drugs but to come away from that crash with the injuries she has is just amazing
7255361 at first she had a lot of trouble breathing because of her lung injuries but shes getting better all the time
7255362 the first i heard about the crash was when kims boyfriend phoned me on wednesday and said theres been a plane accident and kim was on board
7255363 my heart stopped and i felt sick then we had the terrible wait for news its impossible to describe how difficult that was
7255364 because of her damaged lung she couldnt tell anyone who she was

7255389 but quickly god began to show steven that if he ever believed the songs he was writing singing and recording before may 21st and marias loss that they must still be true now its the familys hope that these appearances will serve as a chance to proclaim to a watching world what they know and are deeply convinced of even in these difficult days the gospel is true and faith in christ is our hope

7255391 there are two directions you can go with this research
7255392 some might say this suggests that parents should have their kids attend places of worship or if we use it to help explain why religious participation has a positive effect on academics parents who arent interested in attending church can consider how to structure their kids time to allow access to the same beneficial social networks and opportunities religious institutions provide

7255397 these simulations show that young stars can form in the neighbourhood of supermassive black holes as long as there is a reasonable supply of massive clouds of gas from further out in the galaxy
7255398 that the stars currently present around the galaxys supermassive black hole have relatively short lifetimes of about 10 million years which suggests that this process is likely to be repetitive
7255399 such a steady supply of stars into the vicinity of the black hole and a diet of gas directly accreted by the black hole may help us understand the origin of supermassive black holes in our and other galaxies in the universe

7255421 the public doesnt know who on earth john mccain is
7255422 simply doesnt understand the challenges americas working families are facing because he isnt remotely affected by them
7255423 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7255424 we have seen some text campaigns in the many hundreds of thousands of opt in mobile users over the past couple years all in the consumer products services realm
7255425 this is the first massive effort in the political world
7255426 its a pretty big challenge because were under a strict time constraint to get all those messages out
7255427 never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world
7255428 i am not going to tell you my iq because i dont want to make you jealous but my brother is a genius and i am up there with him and by the way i cant have children because i have cysts on my ovaries
7255429 about half of our transports will continue by ground but a helicopter can cut our time getting to some outlying communities by 65 to 75 percent for example a round trip two hour ground transport to and from youngstown would take about 30 minutes by helicopter
7255430 we anticipate we may be able to transport about 600 patients a year by helicopter and that our overall number of transports will increase because our transport team will be freed up to accept more
7255431 most of our ground transports currently take on average about one hour we can now use the helicopter for those transports and wont have to wait for it to arrive from another hospital before picking up our team and then heading out to meet the patient
7255432 ha sido una decisi n de manuel y hay que respetarla tiene s lo 25 a os le considero como un hijo pero lo cierto es que l ya no soportaba m s los problemas que le atenazaban desde hace demasiado tiempo

7255434 i wasnt even sure of my medal chances at all
7255435 thats it its a silver medal i am so happy with this and then i won i cant believe it im so happy
7255436 i had some very wise words and some very good advice before coming into the 10m competition to just enjoy it have fun and thats what i thought right from the very first dive in the prelims to the very last dive in the final
7255437 i was definitely stressing it to myself just enjoy the moment there is nothing you can do to change whats about to happen so just enjoy it and it worked
7255438 its a real question whether the state should be on the hook for that large an expenditure for someone who is going to be in office for such a short period of time
7255439 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
7255440 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
7255441 democratic leaders know that these counterproductive proposals will not become law
7255442 they need to stop standing in the way of expanding domestic production and take meaningful steps now to address the pain caused by high energy prices
7255443 when congress returns they should remove this restriction so we can get these vast oil resources from the ocean floor to your gas tank
7255444 thats how i figure out some of my new maneuvers for my act
7255445 ill lay awake at night wondering what would happen if i did this the next day ill go out and try it
7255446 the people in coshocton really make me feel at home
7255447 the community is very much like where i grew up the people the work ethic its a neat town
7255448 there are so many aspects of aviation that are so rewarding
7255449 if i can share with the crowd and have their day become a pleasurable day watching an air show that makes me feel really good
7255450 im tired not just me but other people in massillon of getting treated like crap by the court
7255451 i thought it would be nice to do something for the community and we knew they needed help
7255452 it the poker run has gone really well considering we are a new business we are still new and a lot of people dont know about us yet
7255453 i worked for an animal shelter and i have always been into animal rights we couldnt take a dog home with us so we wanted to do what we could
7255454 it reminds me of home we have festivals like this there
7255455 the prime minister will be to blame if this happens just like zhan videnov bulgarias socialist pm in 1995 6 was to blame for the previous collapse and neither the rockers nor the underwater fishing will save him during the summer stanishev is looking for stuff to do on the sea coast and during the winter in the resort of bansko but this wont work out
7255456 they came for the steel companies and nobody said anything they came for the auto companies and nobody said anything they came for the office companies people who did white collar service jobs and no one said anything and they came for the professional jobs that could be outsourced and nobody said anything
7255457 i sure miss him a lot i bought sundown mark vs king from him he didnt want to sell him
7255458 he helped a lot of people the kind who would have never asked for it
7255459 we never realized how many people dad had helped through the years
7255460 but it made it easy when we started this hunt to get help from the community
7255461 we have had amazing support from the community and we sure thank them
7255462 it is about the friendships you make relaxing having fun and you meet a lot of different people

7255469 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well and so i think hes made a very wise selection
7255470 have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7255471 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7255472 obviously joe and i have been on different philosophical sides but i consider him a good friend and good man
7255473 it will be more difficult now senator mccain to criticize barack obamas foreign policy credentials when someone like joe biden is on the ticket a very experienced and respected voice on capitol hill in these matters
7255474 well ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different counties
7255475 i never agreed with that but i appreciate very much his dedication to trying to solve this genocide thats going in darfur and other things that joe biden has done but we really have different approaches to many national security issues i look forward to whoever my running mate will be having a respectful debate with him on that as well
7255476 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy

7255519 nothing is clear on the political side but unfortunately this also means the economy is condemned to suffer some more
7255520 i think in the coming days we are going to see a hardening of positions again as a matter of political pride but because both parties need some kind of settlement for their political future they will also resume the talks very soon
7255521 there is a lot of political and economic pressure on these guys but i think there is now more pressure on tsvangirai especially from sadc
7255522 its a very crucial week in many respects both men mugabe and tsvangirai will have to stand firm or concede some ground and it doesnt look like its going to be mugabe
7255523 i think yes they will talk but i dont see a quick or internationally acceptable agreement coming out soon
7255524 we need a strong government which will take bold decisions without flinching
7255525 its not very clear yet but we are hearing of tension of officials who think that morgan tsvangirai is wrong in not signing what is on the table
7255526 their mdc challenge will be to keep their ranks tight because the agreement on the table basically keeps mugabe and zanu pf firmly in power
7255527 the entire somali coastline is now under control of the islamists
7255528 according to our information the money they make from piracy and ransoms goes to support al shabaab activities onshore
7255529 its crazy we have never seen anything like it in our years of tracking them
7255530 theyve broken all records for piracy in this region and indeed the whole world
7255531 back in 2005 there were just five somali pirate gangs with fewer than 100 gunmen
7255532 now that youths who used to work as bodyguards for warlords or militia for the government see the rewards available at sea our estimate is that there are between 1 100 and 1 200 pirates

7255561 i was doubtful about my future but when speaking with guardiola he told me he believed in me and felt i could help the team a lot
7255562 i only wanted to stay if the manager believed in me and if i could bring something to the team
7255563 there are a lot of midfielders in the team but they all have different qualities guardiola has asked me to come from deep and score goals
7255564 i certainly havent heard anything from my ceo or chairman while ive been here
7255565 im just continuing to do the same job that ive been doing which is to try and take things forward to make sure we have all we need to make this a strong sport through 2012 and beyond
7255566 i would say its a pretty good bet id bet my job on it
7255567 i would question the way im working and what im achieving a good deal more than anyone else and thats essential
7255568 you have to look very carefully and consider if what youre doing is the right thing you take a lot of steps to make sure its the right thing you audit your decisions you make things a team decision
7255569 its of interest to me that four or five of the other governing bodies in europe want to come and have a look at what were doing because weve had a really good games
7255570 my perception would be that we havent done as well as we want to nor as well as we need to do we will go back and review the heck out of this and learn the steps we need to take forward
7255571 im very satisfied in the steps weve made if other people arent then thats their decision and i have to abide by it i have heard nothing so i will continue to carry on working
7255572 i think ive done the right things there are challenges its a necessity to have a coherent and consistent leadership so we are all working in the same direction
7255573 i dont think its unfair of me to sit here and say we were very very close that we might have had two or three more medals but that shouldnt change the fact that we are doing the right things in the right way
7255574 if the plan that ive got is going to be agreed by my management and theyre going to be supportive of it then were going to move forward if not i need to know and we can move in a different direction
7255575 i think i should be judged on more than the medal count you need to drill down and look at the performance further down the line
7255576 im disappointed with the performance but frankly our position in helsinki was not great paula radcliffe won the only gold of the world championships in 2005 on the final day our position now is much stronger
7255577 i dont think the expenditure is disproportionate i understand the americans have ploughed 800 000 into their short relays weve put 500 000 into ours
7255578 i think its the first dropped baton in michaels regime as coach its unfortunate the first mistake has been made in this arena
7255579 the level of professionalism of the athletes working with him is very very high and i know the guys are very keen to come back and continue the work and put matters right next year
7255580 hes got a lot of experience and all the argentinian guys are tough players
7255581 ive got to make sure im ready at the start of the match
7255582 i think against guys that prefer clay its important to attack
7255583 clay and grass and hard courts are so different clay court experts are used to playing a long way behind the baseline
7255584 on the hard court if you can get the ball quickly and rush them they dont like to as much you have to try to get some free points off the serve
7255585 i played him ferrer twice i lost to him on clay and beat him on hard courts a few years ago very comfortably
7255586 hes a tough player but its a long way from playing that match a lot of tennis to play before then

7255602 its a high pitched drone continuous between about six at night and five in the morning and dependent on what age you are determines what you interpret it as
7255603 with your concrete action you have greatly inspired the patriotic passion and hard working spirit of people of all ethnic groups in the country encouraged them to actively push forward reform and opening up and the socialist modernization drive and made an outstanding contribution to the international olympic movement
7255604 made significant contributions to the hosting of a high standard and unique olympic games in beijing
7255605 revealing to the world the chinese nations unyielding spirit solidarity and pursuit of peace and progress
7255606 we hope you will earnestly sum up your experience and refrain from complacency and make persistent efforts to win even greater honor for the motherland and people
7255607 i would like to request all of you to abstain from any violence this agitation is for the cause of common people
7255608 no industry can be founded on the dead bodies of the farmers

7255613 so youre probably talking about 20 per cent of the new project and relative to the rest of the roading network its sort of less than 2 or 3 per cent
7255614 we believe land should be owned by new zealand citizens and residents only and our laws should be changed to say that
7255615 why should we allow singaporean australian or american speculators to buy investment properties in our country shutting first time home buyers from the market
7255616 shes got the physique the music to us at 52 shes an inspiration to go on
7255617 i think shes really good and id like to be like her
7255618 it got a little bit too much it all started to sink in and i had to step out and collect my thoughts and my emotions it was a very meaningful moment
7255619 obviously this is the best of times and the worst of times
7255620 the only word right now is surreal but its all a bit fresh to really assign meaning to it ill have time to reflect down the road im just really proud of my team
7255621 it doesnt change anything we cant bring todd back and we cant vindicate what happened
7255622 but i can enjoy this and mourn todds death and try to deal with both those emotions
7255623 im happy for the support i got from so many people in new zealand i live in the us i have a new zealand passport and its a big part of who i am im proud to be a new zealander
7255624 im also very very invested in the us and what weve been doing i feel like a bit of a global citizen ive got a foot in both countries but i cant say enough about the support from everyone at this very trying time
7255625 i just said hi and told her we were gold medallists she watched it on tv she was extremely happy shes getting a lot of phone calls right now
7255626 she sent the team an email to wish them luck the incident involving todd influenced so many other people than just our immediate family
7255627 she just wanted the guys to know she was cheering for them and that her whole family was proud of what were achieving over here
7255628 next time i race im not just going to win im going to wipe the floor
7255629 i can take my leg off and im completely free in the water
7255630 when there is no enemy within the enemies outside cannot hurt you
7255631 an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
7255632 seemed like a fad for hippie types who drove volkswagen vans wore birkenstocks with socks and made their own yogurt now that my own children are launching into adulthood im finally catching on
7255633 interested in services to increase employee productivity minimize absences and enhance the health of their employees
7255634 estimates show that 18 to 20 million american adults age 19 to 64 are not working due to a disability or chronic disease or are not working because of health reasons
7255635 along these same lines nearly 40 percent of u s workers experience fatigue according to a study in the january journal of occupational and environmental medicine researchers noted that the effects of fatigue most related to a wide range of physical and mental health problems on health related lost productive time is not just absenteeism but also days the employee is at work and is performing at less than full capacity because of health reasons for u s employers fatigue carries overall estimated costs of more than 136 billion per year in health related lost productivity 101 billion more than for workers without fatigue eighty four percent of the costs were related to reduced performance while at work rather than absences

7255697 an agnostic buddhist looks to the dharma for metaphors of existential
7255698 enlightenment and eternal life are conceived as things that can be 10 instead of ideas that challenge us on the most fundamental levels
7255699 one consequence of this process of formalization and institutionalization is that the religion becomes reabsorbed into the dimension of having
7255700 what is the meaning and purpose of life in the light of inevitable death
7255701 fully realizing both authentic being for oneself and authentic being for others
7255702 the essence of buddhist faith resides in an ontological commitment that is prior to all articulate formulations
7255703 it means to keep alive the perplexity at the heart of our life to acknowledge that fundamentally we do not know what is going on to question whatever arises
7255704 to cling to the idea of rebirth can deaden the questioning of what it means to be human
7255705 tended to emphasize its psychological rather than its cosmological implications
7255706 i believe in change rather than tradition particularly when dealing with our fast paced american culture

7255739 ludc ovviamente libera di aderire o meno a questo progetto ma ritengo che proprio nel momento in cui si parla di statuto e di regole del pdl ci sia una grande occasione anche per i centristi di entrare a far parte in quello che diverrebbe il pi grande partito popolare nazionale in europa dunque una bella occasione le nostre porte restano aperte ma in ogni caso noi andiamo avanti con il nostro progetto

7255749 migration of oil from high oil content filling to the chocolate coating can result in undesirable quality changes in filled chocolate confectionery products
7255750 the objective of this study was to monitor and model peanut oil migration in a 2 layer chocolate peanut butter paste model confectionery
7255751 this study describes the dynamic nature of the interface between the chocolate and peanut butter paste layers quantifies the mass transfer from the peanut butter paste to the chocolate and reinforces the importance of temperature control
7255752 oil migration in chocolate peanut butter paste confectionery as a function of chocolate formulation
7255753 were interested in the natural organisation of food because this occurs at the nano level
7255754 with a fat soluble vitamin in the oil you can make a nano emulsion put them into a drink and they will be invisible
7255755 we do know that if we reduce the fat crystal size we can improve functionality and put less fat in the product

7255760 for a long time the board of directors has been aware that the two very different business models of ingredients and sugar respectively were not an optimal combination
7255761 with these words the board of directors asks the annual general meeting for a mandate to close the sale of danisco sugar to german based nordzucker
7255762 if the annual general meeting rejects the proposal the board of directors will consider it a mandate to work towards an independent stock exchange listing or other alternatives
7255763 we are working hard to become a market driven organisation through and through by for example optimising and motivating our sales force so that danisco is at the top of relevant customers minds we want to be the company with the strongest innovation team the innovative company which others want to cooperate with and finally we want to be leading in sustainable production and products
7255764 we already have products in all those areas today but we want to be among the three largest and best in the world this requires an effort and could also involve acquisitions we are determined to be in the top three because we know that it is a market with solid growth rates
7255765 dupont has the expertise we dont have and we have what dupont doesnt have together we form a partnership that will end up in a sustainable product based on residue from for instance agriculture or forestry
7255766 each party is initially investing up to dkk 350 million over the next three years that is a lot of money but just listen to this we foresee a market for second generation bioethanol of at least usd 75 billion in 2020 corresponding to around dkk 400 billion
7255767 everyone is talking about a replacement for chemical preservatives but first of all no one has even defined what is natural
7255768 and identify areas in which the industry is in need
7255769 the most intriguing finding was that subjects seemed to accept mushrooms as a palatable and suitable culinary substitute for meat
7255770 they didnt compensate for the lower calorie mushroom meal by eating more food later in the day
7255771 we found that overtly substituting ground white button mushrooms for lean ground beef in a single meal for four consecutive days significantly reduced daily energy and fat intake while maintaining ratings of palatability appetite satiation and satiety
7255772 the method of substituting one food for another within familiar recipes may be more appealing to many prospective dieters than making more dramatic or restrictive changes in dietary behaviour
7255773 essential for assessing potential utility of a food substitution since palatability is known to exert a strong influence on
7255774 in addition the fat content of a food tends to increase palatability for us populations which is one reason that overconsumption of high fat foods is thought to occur
7255775 this example of how energy and fat content in the diet may be decreased while maintaining palatability may be useful for the development of generalizable strategies for weight management
7255776 lack of energy compensation over 4 days when white button mushrooms are substituted for beef
7255777 this multiplicity of roles means water presents many challenges to bakers
7255778 salt is a powerful tool for food preservation as it locks up water making it unavailable for changes it is 11 times more powerful than sugar
7255779 this move towards so called healthier products means the whole way we balance formulations to control water activity has to change
7255780 to control future water activity you have to consider the start of the process
7255781 if you have done your job properly at the beginning then there is less of an issue as some of the water activity will be controlled
7255782 baking is one of those strange food preparations processes where first of all you have to add water and then remove it again
7255783 the idea is the same as mobility but the marketing is different
7255784 people dont buy boats as there is a lack of boat spaces on swiss lakes our aim is to ensure that the few existing spaces can be used by more sailors
7255785 people think about getting a sailing licence but then realise they cant afford a boat and if you want a boat space youre on a waiting list for between ten to 20 years so they wonder why bother getting a licence straight away
7255786 the downside is that you have to reserve in advance and then pay when you dont quite know what the weather conditions will be like on the day
7255787 but even if we had our own boat we would still stay with sailcom as they have lots of different boats all over switzerland
7255788 we are pushing for more members in french speaking regions but as in the italian speaking part we found that people prefer to own rather than share and its hard to convince them to join
7255789 its a hopeless situation and something weve been stuck with for years
7255790 in the olden days boats were small and long but now theyre long and wide so if a port gets renovated often there are fewer spaces
7255791 take into account wide disparities in dietary habits due to cultural differences in eating patters and the varying availability of food products across europe
7255792 the early involvement of stakeholders is recommended to promote the acceptance of messages
7255793 low fat foods are ok but they are not the same as full fat
7255794 fat does something in the mouth that we dont know about little is known about how food breaks down and where to locate ingredients
7255795 we want what fat is there to do the same as it does in a higher fat product
7255796 they will chew it spit it out and we will look at it
7255797 we will also look at similar off the shelf biscuits chews and softer foods like mayonnaise
7255798 you can see quite a big difference just on the first bite
7255799 we could carry it out for 50 000 or 60 000 or for 100 000
7255800 the world learned more about china and china learned more about the rest of the world
7255801 the ioc is not a sovereign organization and we have to respect chinese law
7255802 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7255803 may tend to shed light on the existence or non existence of a pattern or system of impropriety
7255804 its been three years and eight months they studied it and scheduled the signing and then they cancel everything what is that
7255805 we walked around it examined it and took pictures because there is no construction documentation we established the volume of work and concluded an agreement with a contractor
7255806 we saw that the hospital suffered several direct hits from artillery and tanks the georgian military knew that it was a hospital and that it was working and its not clear how such a thing could be possible in the 21st century
7255807 we have already got offers for the supplying of equipment to the hospital from foreign companies including siemens our long term partner the citys georgian and ossetian communities also offered their financial help for the hospital the city budget will also allocate money for these purposes
7255808 be a sinner and sin boldly but believe and rejoice in christ even more boldly pray boldly you too are a mighty sinner
7255809 get behind me satan you are a stumbling block to me you do not have in mind the things of god but the things of men
7255810 thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
7255811 gods will is done when he breaks and hinders every evil plan and purpose of the devil the world and our sinful nature which do not want us to hallow gods name or let his kingdom come and when he strengthens and keeps us firm in his word and faith until we die this is his good and gracious will
7255812 then jesus said to his disciples if anyone would come after me he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me
7255813 for whoever wants to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for me will find it
7255814 men do not differ much about what things they will call evils they differ enormously about what evils they will call excusable
7255815 the great majority of athletes had the opportunity to compete at their best and they did so
7255816 i have immense pride in the performances of these athletes an outstanding performance
7255817 the poise and the focus of matthew and what he achieved was simply outstanding
7255818 we dont have as great issues as we had here
7255819 we knew the heat and humidity and pollution and those things were going to be a big issue
7255820 we are used to competing in great britain all of our sports do it regularly
7255821 and the other great advantage that we have is that many of our sports have a base in europe from which they can move across to london close to the games
7255822 great britain isnt going to stay ahead of us if they beat us in the ashes you want to go back and get them dont you
7255823 well we shouldnt be scared of competition i think we should be very pleased to be engaging with china in sport
7255824 a legacy of these games is that australians must have a better understanding of china
7255825 there would have been a lot of perceptions that would have been blown away

7255847 its unlikely that we will see another olympics of this scope and stature again
7255848 the international olympic committee themselves recognise that this is the last edition of a games which is going to look and feel like this
7255849 the stadium will be a very different concept to beijing

7255982 as i live says the lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall give praise to god
7255983 the majority of the companies have been focusing on positive incentives but the employers that have been starting mandatory programs are clearly getting a lot of attention
7255984 youve got one third of your life spent in the workplace
7255985 its an incredible opportunity to take advantage of that time and look at the tie between wellness absenteeism and medical costs thats why the employer is so focused on this
7255986 theres almost no protection from intrusions of private corporations into your private life
7255987 the argument weve made in this case is that what companies do to smokers could be done to people who are overweight or have high cholesterol or ride motorcycles or sky dive
7255988 our intent was to have a culture of wellness for our associates but also to address the issue of rising medical costs
7255989 i would be the first to admit when scotts introduced this i thought are they being big brother poking their noses into something they shouldnt
7255990 said bonnie hohlbein vice president of finance global technology and operations for scotts but hohlbein submitted to the assessment and what she learned led her to make changes
7255991 it was sort of shocking to see youre not in the normal weight range
7255992 it depends on what motivates people but having the money penalty and the nice facility right there helped get me started
7255993 we attempt to position this as more of an incentive based program
7255994 but the people who elect not to participate in the wellness activities may have a different term to describe it
7255995 while it is questionable whether testing for nicotine a lawful substance will receive legal approval employer sponsored programs prohibiting smoking in the workplace and discouraging smoking in the workforce are already sanctioned
7255996 the money spent on those kinds of schemes would be far better spent on lobbying for universal health care or giving workers paid sick days 50 percent of employees in the private sector dont have any paid sick days
7255997 a lot of these approaches are making the assumption that all of these behaviors are completely in someones control
7255998 but it can be exceedingly difficult to change those behaviors a simple punishment isnt enough to make that kind of thing happen
7255999 this should be a wake up call to baby boomers
7256000 they arent factoring expenses for long term care into their retirement planning and are missing an opportunity to protect themselves
7256001 it was the companys decision i knew i had no more options and this will be good for me
7256002 employers are saying they can no longer afford to subsidize bad behavior
7256003 weve known for a long time that smoking is hazardous to health and people are still smoking education hasnt worked smoking cessation programs havent worked you have to make the individual pay for the bad habit
7256004 its not unfair to make you pay for the extra costs youve created
7256005 are you going to make fat people pay more or those of us who have dangerous hobbies like skiing or hang gliding it goes on and on pretty soon your employer knows everything about your private life in order to save on health care costs
7256006 when i found out it was legal to discriminate against smokers in 2002 those were my marching orders
7256007 it meant smokers would pay twice as much for their health insurance as non smokers immediately 40 people stopped smoking
7256008 people stop for monetary reasons why isnt health enough of a reason
7256009 probably 90 percent of companies dont know you can do this
7256010 employers realize its a morale problem for the 20 to 25 percent of people who smoke
7256011 once you get past all the positive ways to get them to stop employers look at smoking bans and say were not going there
7256012 the national average is 20 percent were about 7 percent high
7256013 it takes the average smoker six to nine attempts to stop we subsidize up to six quit attempts
7256014 but weve looked at one cost model and the potential saving for us is about 2 3 million a year
7256015 wont pay for classes they wont give employees time to go to classes they wont even pay for the nicotine patch they havent tried the voluntary approach
7256016 if you talk to people in the corporate health business theyll tell you its coming
7256017 fifty to 70 percent of health care costs are predicated on poor behavior
7256018 all employers are looking at what they can do to assist their employees in behavioral changes to bring down the cost of health care
7256019 this should be a wake up call to baby boomers they arent factoring expenses for long term care into their retirement planning and are missing an opportunity to protect themselves
7256020 baby boomers believe they have more coverage than they actually do giving them a false feeling of financial preparedness to handle long term care costs

7256034 villa are a top six or seven side they have got some excellent players and they cause you some problems
7256035 carew is a fantastic target man but then they have good pace and good ability around him so they have all the armour to be a decent side and they are so it was a great result for us
7256036 i think one or two things have happened that happened last week and we have to make sure mentally more than anything else that we are switched on
7256037 what is most positive is that we have a very united group we are good friends and on top of this we have enormous quality as footballers

7256041 caj yang dikenakan adalah untuk menanggung kos kain kapan membayar upah jurumandi kerja menggali kubur caj minyak kenderaan jenazah serta elaun pemandu kalau dicongak jumlahnya dalam lingkungan rm500 sahaja terutamanya untuk lokasi tempatan tetapi jika mayat perlu dihantar ke luar kawasan maka caj mengikut kilometer akan dikenakan
7256042 mereka dikenakan sehingga rm1 700 untuk keseluruhan proses pengkebumian jenazah dan tidak pernah timbul persoalan tentang kos apa pun perkara yang lebih penting untuk orang ramai fikirkan ialah kepakaran yang disediakan oleh setiap orang yang terlibat
7256043 mereka mempunyai kemahiran yang tidak banyak dikuasai contohnya memandikan dan mengkafankan mayat atau menggali kubur banyak perkara seperti tertib dan pengetahuan agama yang diperlukan untuk melakukannya kalau pihak keluarga boleh melakukannya sendiri mereka sudah boleh memotong kos di bahagian itu cuma mungkin kos yang perlu dibayar ialah untuk kain kafan dan majlis tahlil atau talkin
7256044 jenazah perlu disegerakan pengkebumiannya jadi kalau keluarga si mati tidak mampu atau tidak mempunyai waris yang dapat membantu pihak kami akan membantu menanggung kos itu dengan bantuan majlis agama kerajaan negeri di sesetengah tempat ada badan bukan kerajaan atau berasaskan keuntungan yang menghulurkan bantuan seperti pertubuhan kebajikan islam malaysia perkim dan sebagainya
7256045 mengikut amalan kadar perbelanjaan pengurusan jenazah diuruskan oleh badan badan khairiat seperti setiap kariah masjid atau surau di negeri masing masing badan badan ini menjalankan tugas lebih kepada amalan kebajikan dan tolong menolong kepada ahli kariah yang kematian ahli keluarga

7256061 probably 90 percent of companies dont know you can do this
7256062 employers realize its a morale problem for the 20 to 25 percent of people who smoke
7256063 once you get past all the positive ways to get them to stop employers look at smoking bans and say were not going there
7256064 the national average is 20 percent were about 7 percent high
7256065 it takes the average smoker six to nine attempts to stop we subsidize up to six quit attempts
7256066 but weve looked at one cost model and the potential saving for us is about 2 3 million a year
7256067 wont pay for classes they wont give employees time to go to classes they wont even pay for the nicotine patch they havent tried the voluntary approach
7256068 if you talk to people in the corporate health business theyll tell you its coming
7256069 fifty to 70 percent of health care costs are predicated on poor behavior
7256070 all employers are looking at what they can do to assist their employees in behavioral changes to bring down the cost of health care
7256071 diabetes is such a high impact disease affecting 10 of the population and costly as well
7256072 theres a lot of synergy to be gained by focusing on exercise and nutrition
7256073 it doesnt have to be an expensive drug it doesnt have to take an expensive program to reduce risk especially if you have a large population
7256074 if you get people to lose five or 10 pounds and keep it off that has pretty impressive effects on preventing diabetes every little bit helps
7256075 i see a lot of employers doing that better and better i see a lot of employers doing a know your numbers campaign and linking that to a health risk assessment
7256076 careful management of the disease is crucial to avoiding complications and onset of other health problems employers can encourage their health vendors to identify diabetes risks encourage individuals to be tested and to promote effective care management strategies this is a business imperative
7256077 employers increasingly recognize the impact of diabetes on the health and productivity of their workforce and there is growing evidence that effective management of diabetes reduces complications reduces health care costs and protects employee productivity
7256078 a number of employees got off their diabetes medications completely as a result of their lifestyle changes
7256079 if we can affect several lives then we feel like were making some progress
7256080 diabetes is one of the predominant risk factors in our population it was a high cost issue for us from a claims perspective and it seemed to be an area that you can get your arms around what youre trying to do is influence peoples lifestyles more than anything else
7256081 hospira chose to participate in the program to help reduce the costs and improve the health of our employees with diabetes
7256082 we believe we will have happier and healthier employees as well as lower long term medical and absenteeism costs for this group most importantly employee response has been overwhelmingly favorable with more than 130 individuals enrolled in the program to date
7256083 start to think about reaching the most people in some way
7256084 take a multimodal approach know that small sustained changes result in a big payoff
7256085 employees create a support network and its a very personal message coming from the employer that we care about your health
7256086 definitely helps people and gets the interest up the commitment to participate
7256087 it costs more to collect the data and crunch the metrics than it does to do the program
7256088 the study reveals that the use or absence of a few core best practices in employee health management could explain cost differences of up to 50 between two otherwise comparable employers
7256089 in essence every self insured employer is managing its own health plan the employers who succeed at managing health costs do a better job of managing employee health
7256090 its hard to implement health programs that change employee behavior on a foundation of sloppy administrative practices
7256091 we discovered a troubling pattern whereby employers use financial models and network procurement strategies to manage health costs instead of addressing the underlying clinical risks driving the demand for health care
7256092 the implications of these findings are significant it explains why so many employers churn between health plans and cut coverage but still cant get relief from long term health cost trends
7256093 employers must re evaluate their health and procurement strategies while the industry health and benefit vendors brokers and consultants should consider repositioning traditional health and benefit solutions to focus on employee health
7256094 the results of our study show that employers already navigating this path have reaped an enormous competitive advantage through improved health and productivity at lower cost
7256095 in companies where employee health is valued the employer and employee both benefit
7256096 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again

7256098 that we the undersigned members of the nonpartisan farmers league hereby respectfully petition and urge the officers of the league to make arrangements for the calling of a convention of duly elected delegates from each county to form a constitution and by laws to embrace therein the initiative referendum and the recall in order to insure that the wishes of the majority of the members shall at all times guide and determine the policies of the organization and also to provide therein for the placing of the organization on a firmer financial basis by the election of officers whose duties are definitely prescribed whose salaries are fixed and who will owe this organization a strict accountability for the disbursement of all moneys belonging therein
7256099 these imported scalists socialists could come and organize the farmers and i w w s to gather and organization that would destroy the farmers first and then all other taxpayers and to this day there is lots of farmers just as blind as ever
7256100 no formal claim of responsibility has been made and the motive for the kidnapping remains unknown as well there have been no demands

7256173 the top back office priority of private banks is to find a standardized solution for fund transaction processing this is an area that is currently considered as archaic manually intensive and lengthy
7256174 drivers for improvement in this area are that funds are a key part of clients investment portfolios along with the wider variety of transaction processes employed by fund providers research respondents claimed that while there are proficient providers in certain markets there is no industry wide solution
7256175 if all corporate action messaging from start to finish were accomplished via swift format the process would be far cleaner i do understand that corporate actions can be very complex so end to end automation via swift is no small challenge yet a solution is sorely needed and swift is well placed to help by being a leader we all know this it is intuitive so why hasnt it happened
7256176 so the question for swift is this how will you help us create the new applications and business solutions to run over this wonderful new network to leverage the awesome power and ingenuity of the incredible community that you represent how will you help us get rid of all these legacy infrastructures how can you help our slow moving industry move faster to take full advantage of all the new possibilities thats the challenge

7256211 i think that the region should take over county waterworks
7256212 theres a benefit to the city having a single water purveyor within the city limits
7256213 now the argument is should district 40 expand to cover the whole city or should the city take it over
7256214 theres no reason to believe that if we took over the water district that we wouldnt do an equal or better job for the same or less amount of money
7256215 i do think there will continue to be discussions because local control is always better in these kind of service providing situations

7256229 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7256230 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7256231 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7256232 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7256233 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7256234 you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of privatizing social security

7256238 its accuracy in distinguishing actual or potential security violators from innocent test takers is insufficient to justify reliance on its use in employee security screening in federal agencies
7256239 polygraph testing as currently used has extremely serious limitations in such screening applications if the intent is both to identify security risks and protect valued employees
7256240 right now the polygraph is the best tool they have at their hands but its not a tool thats without problems

7256250 all the doncaster branches of the legion are disgusted that there will not be a veterans day parade
7256251 the council do not seem to care about the achievements of servicemen and women
7256252 i am not homophobic but the council supported both doncaster pride and the mayors civic parade
7256253 one of our legion members spoke to an official at the civic offices who told him we couldnt have a parade this year because the council did not have the amenities
7256254 i rang the official and she effectively told me the police couldnt afford the staff to block off the roads
7256255 i wrote to say i was sorely disappointed that we were not being allowed to parade in our own town we just wanted to parade our standards and colours

7256278 nous avons besoin de r formes de structures nous navons pas besoin dun plan de relance qui serait un plan de relance artificiel
7256279 la responsabilit du gouvernement cest davoir grill de fa on inefficace ses cartouches avec le paquet fiscal et d tre priv aujourdhui de tout moyen de soutien l conomie
7256280 r formes de structure et relance sont compl mentaires et non pas antagonistes
7256281 une r forme de structure renforce le potentiel de croissance conomique long terme mais court terme elle fait des perdants
7256282 en p riode de forte croissance la prosp rit g n rale noie les co ts subis par les perdants les r formes sont plus faciles faire adopter en p riode de r cession comme cest aujourdhui le cas des blocages apparaissent
7256283 cest pour cela quune relance qui pourrait prendre la forme dune baisse de limp t sur le revenu et dune revalorisation des minima sociaux serait justifi e
7256284 en ne r agissant pas au ralentissement et en se tenant la m me strat gie de r formes structurelles la france ne prend pas la mesure de la situation
7256285 une r cession technique de l conomie fran aise soit deux trimestres cons cutifs de croissance n gatifs est possible
7256286 la france est elle au bord de la r cession
7256287 les deux moteurs de la croissance fran aise la consommation et linvestissement sont en panne du fait de la hausse de linflation et de l rosion de la croissance des revenus
7256288 il y a des raisons de penser que la fin 2008 sera meilleure
7256289 un l ger mieux est attendu partir de la mi 2009 la faveur de la dissipation de la plupart des facteurs n gatifs qui ont pes sur la croissance fran aise
7256290 un euro plus faible et une stabilisation des prix des mati res premi res ne seront sans doute pas suffisants pour compenser le recul attendu de la demande interne et nous pensons donc que la france est entr e dans une p riode de tr s faible croissance qui pourrait entra ner une remont e du ch mage
7256291 la plupart des facteurs qui avaient permis un redressement de lactivit partir de la fin 2005 apr s le ralentissement de 2001 2002 connaissent des volutions d favorables

7256299 in every encounter we either give life or we drain it there is no neutral exchange we enhance human dignity or we diminish it the success or failure of a given day is measured by the quality of our interest and compassion toward those around us
7256300 ok chris here you have a world class opportunity are you giving or draining life in your day to day interaction with the kingdom of god that surrounds you are your individual transactions with your fellow beings all created in gods image btw giving or taking energy at the end of the day if we toted up the thousand or so transactions that youve had with your wife children workmates neighbors and the broader mass of society that you swim in what would your life giving quotient be would it be positive neutral could it be negative

7256318 the problem of atm frauds is global in nature and its ramifications have been felt in india as well it is a big threat and it requires a coordinated and cooperative action on the part of all the stakeholders
7256319 direct access to the bank account through the atm card will not cause huge per client losses but collectively in the coming days it can be a huge figure
7256320 in a recent case investigated by my team in nagpur region atm cards belonging to new applicants were dispachted through official couriers at the residences of the victims after their applications were sanctioned by the bank authorities
7256321 interestingly the atm cards which belonged to applicants whose addresses were either not traced or were absent during delivery were received by the bank officials and after getting the possession of the same cards they started withdrawing the money from the accounts of the depositors of the bank
7256322 banks never ask for personal information of their patrons over the e mail through post or by sending executives customers should very carefully mention their user ids credit card numbers and passwords under their own watchful eyes
7256323 the it act 2000 does not contain any specific provisions regarding the same and the traditional law of ipc 1860 also cannot be relied solely and independently to tackle this problem

7256424 and then there is sen obamas newness to public life and the concerns some people have as to whether hes ready
7256425 my view is that obamas pick has become more important because of mccains attacks about whether hes ready to lead or not
7256426 with international problems swirling around even as iraq recedes hes got to get his bona fides on national security in order
7256427 sen biden doesnt believe that sen obama is ready to serve as president

7256475 this is a signal to the russians and the signal is we are not alone the world is with us
7256476 i dont think such a buildup will foster the stabilization of the atmosphere in the region
7256477 its highly important for us here to have representatives of the navy of our biggest friend the u s

7256484 weve had another 1 5mm of rain overnight and it just cant dry up if it keeps raining
7256485 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7256486 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond
7256487 we are continuing to raise our concerns at senior levels of the chinese government and to follow their cases closely
7256488 he does so for a simple reason the color of his skin
7256489 the real embarassent for democrats is that this will be 3 for 3 in losing to a mediocre republican
7256490 you cant you cant criticize the little black man child
7256491 at least try and pretend you are scrutinizing it is quite obvious that you arent right now
7256492 how many votes will obama get simply because hes black
7256493 our candidate sucks but not as bad as the 2000 republican candidate sucks
7256494 whose only claim was that he killed an unarmed vietnamese
7256495 i dont just sit in front of the computer at all hours of the day
7256496 but its dinner time in taiwan we have fresh tuna jasmine rice fresh pineapple guava snow peas watermelon and salad then family time
7256497 those who oppose him do so in part if not entirely on his race
7256498 these palestinian supporters who have endured hardship to deliver their message to the world and to express their objection to the harsh siege on gaza deserve every support and appreciation

7256502 do you really think nuns are all wizened funereal old ladies
7256503 today its not like that any more thanks to an injection of youth and vitality brought to our country by foreign girls
7256504 nuns are women above all else and beauty is a gift from god
7256505 but you need a bit of courage to do something like this nuns deserve much more attention they they get
7256506 there is also such a thing as a chaste ideal which comes from the heart and the soul and has a beneficial effect on those who come into contact with it after all did not the russian writer dostoyevsky say that beauty would save the world
7256507 i have had some e mails from christians who perhaps have not grasped the evangelising spirit of the initiative or the potential of the internet which is a marvellous tool for spreading the christian message unfortunately some people still have a closed mentality

7256511 but not like this i ran according to plan but it wasnt enough i didnt know what place i was in but i just kept focusing on catching people
7256512 the world learned more about china and china learned more about the rest of world
7256513 the ioc and the olympic games cannot force changes on sovereign nations or solve all the ills of the world but we can and we do contribute to positive change through sport
7256514 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7256515 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7256516 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7256517 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behaviour in any meaningful way

7256526 my parents worked very hard for what they had and are heart stricken by what has happened to them
7256527 cheryl contacted the landlord to put them on notice and begged them to help
7256528 so if theyre heartbroken about what happened to their lives they had an opportunity to be heartbroken about what was happening to cheryls
7256529 for the first time i can just relax and enjoy my house which was my whole purpose in moving here in the first place

7256531 the garment business is very quiet people are cutting overhead cutting expenses theyre sending fewer people to the show
7256532 they want to know what the trends are but theyre not placing it the order yet they want to feel it out and get a sense of it

7256542 the dark days will be worth all they cost if they teach us that political service is for the purpose of serving our fellow south africans
7256543 the unwritten economic and social compact that enjoys broad support across the political centre is coming under strain within the tripartite alliance
7256544 there are political illiterates among us who are trying to pretend the differences of policy and strategy between the anc and the ifp will be wiped out merely because the leader of the anc is a zulu
7256545 zuma has been a zulu all his life and he has always been a member of the anc he was an anc minister representing the interests of his party and this has nothing to do with being a zulu
7256546 co operation agreements with other parties should be made after the people have spoken at the ballot box and not before

7256550 i think in his heart of hearts he thought in the end he wouldnt get it
7256551 during the vetting process you mostly hear why you wouldnt be a good candidate
7256552 i get the sense that he was quite serious about thinking through about the nature of who his partner will be there and i think the role of the vice president as a future partner in government

7256573 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7256574 hes still able to turn his legs over fast enough with high power
7256575 he overcomes his average start and just doesnt slow down as others do in the last 30 to 40 meters hes able to relax and coordinate his longer legs
7256576 no one can really know exactly how fast a human may be able to run
7256577 we have no way of knowing if humans might not have been even faster centuries or millennia ago
7256578 senator obama sees community health centers as a vital part of efforts to invest in prevention and reduce costs
7256579 ive heard complaints from a handful of constituents but ive also had calls from people in the health care profession complaining
7256580 the medical professionals who have come to me are accusing the university of dumping patients on its neighboring institutions whether its being implemented in the way thats in the best interest of the patient i cant tell you
7256581 was running a campaign to cut coverage for the poor
7256582 in the past we opened our doors and saw whoever came
7256583 we would see a patient who had general pneumonia and if we needed to see a patient who needed a liver transplant that liver transplant patient couldnt get in the door
7256584 we were taking general patients away from mercy hospital michael reese and they were financially at risk
7256585 we harmed other hospitals without knowing we harmed other hospitals
7256586 the collapse of the health care system was driving more and more people to the emergency room
7256587 the trend line was and is a disastrous one from the standpoint of maintaining the hospital their goal was to find an answer

7256599 als brussel en walloni met elkaar verbonden zijn kunnen ze bij de ontbinding van belgi gemakkelijk n staat vormen
7256600 in vlaanderen zijn de politieke en administratieve structuren aanwezig voor een ordentelijke overgang van belgi naar vlaanderen op geen enkele wijze kunnen franstaligen in de rand rond brussel aanspraak maken op het statuut van nationale minderheid het onafhankelijk vlaanderen moet waar mogelijk met nederland de krachten bundelen om samen in europa en de wereld een rol van betekenis te spelen
7256601 vlaanderen mag zich onder geen enkel beding laten opsluiten in een deelstaat die niets anders is dan een soort onderstaat
7256602 volwaardig lid is van europa en niet verstikt wordt in het europese comit van de regios
7256603 zijn we ook bereid om zonder enige vorm van misplaatst paternalisme walloni nog een tijd lang in zijn economische heropstanding te blijven steunen

7256618 it was a very difficult match a very difficult environment our guys embraced it brazil seemed more comfortable in the first set but things changed in the second set and after that it was just two teams battling hard

7256620 its been a very emotionally demanding couple of weeks after we won i had to step outside and collect myself

7256627 maar aan die uitslag hecht ik weinig waarde wij misten toen onze doelvrouw en laatste vrouw twee belangrijke speelsters bij ons
7256628 zoetermeer kreeg veel kansen maar aukje van ooyen keepster red heeft vandaag echt punten voor ons gepakt zij heeft echt leeuwenwerk verricht
7256629 de laatste wedstrijden hopen we nog wat punten te sprokkelen
7256630 maar wat frustreert is dat je geen loon naar werken krijgt we hebben vandaag karakter getoond maar zijn afgestraft op kleine zaken zij benutten de fouten van ons en wij doen dat niet want we hebben absoluut kansen gekregen maar op zulke momenten moeten we het slimmer uitspelen dat frustreert
7256631 we hebben vandaag laten zien dat wij het verdienen om in de tweede klasse te blijven
7256632 volgende week krijgen we zoetermeer op bezoek in waalwijk dat zijn wedstrijden waarin de kansen voor ons liggen en als we die vier punten uiteindelijk halen dan hebben wij een goede competitie achter de rug
7256633 vandaag zetten de scheidsrechters een negatief stempel op de wedstrijd
7256634 die konden de afgelopen seizoenen zelfs geen eerste team op de been brengen
7256635 het heeft moeite gekost maar we hebben geen n kans weggegeven
7256636 maar we wisten ook dat er kansen zouden zijn het bleek dat we fysiek onze grenzen moesten opzoeken we probeerden ons eigen spelletje echter ook te spelen en dat ging super het werkte vandaag allemaal dat geeft vertrouwen
7256637 het heeft moeite gekost maar we hebben geen n kans weggegeven
7256638 ze lijkt wel een lantaarnpaal zo weinig als zij beweegt
7256639 ze weten niet goed wat ze tegen de nummer laatst moeten verwachten
7256640 en nu hadden we van tevoren gezegd we gaan voor de tien maar we moeten dan niet te hard gaan zoeken naar die tiende
7256641 eigenlijk mag het ook niet misgaan vandaag gelukkig dat we weer terug in de tweede klasse zijn daar leer je veel meer het spel is leuker het is sneller maar ook anders je moet veel meer zelf het spel maken zoals we dat vandaag ook deden
7256642 iedereen heeft gistermiddag veel speeltijd gekregen ook de jonge speelsters
7256643 maar we weten waar we in stappen die ervaring hebben we nog van het vorig seizoen
7256644 twee jaar geleden wilde ik eigenlijk al stoppen maar toen werden we kampioen vorig jaar wilde ik geen afscheid nemen met degradatie maar nu stop ik wel denk ik krijg ik toch eindelijk een afscheid ze vroegen wel al of ik door wil gaan maar bij mij weet je het nooit twee jaar geleden stond ik ook met tranen in mijn ogen en liet ik me overhalen het is mijn clubbie t zit in mijn hart

7256648 we were not sharp enough in the first half and our passing was certainly not as good as we expect it to be i dont know why
7256649 you have to give credit to fulham they played very well and they started sharper than us
7256650 of course it is a setback but the result is there and we have to make up for it by winning the next match we have a big game on wednesday in the champions league and need to improve

7256697 but right now i dont feel happy with the result
7256698 ok i have a medal around my neck but when you go out losing after this run we made its really disappointing
7256699 and they made us look bad on defense and our defense all tournament long has been great thats just a compliment to how good that team is theyve got a lot of great shooters theyre well coached theyve got the athletes and they beat us good today
7256700 merrill got us to this game and he played great in the tournament but we gave up six goals in the first quarter and 10 goals by the time we were able to get merrill out
7256701 we prepared for it but some days it isnt your day

7256704 we wanted to make it a defensive game and we just didnt get it done
7256705 they were hitting shots they were making tough shots and it starts kind of steamrolling on you
7256706 the united states of america is not going to win a shootout with the best shooters in the world
7256707 we really stepped up together no one quit finally terry arrived and our only goal was to be on the podium my proudest moment was every single one of us dying for each other

7256759 fighting intensified overnight with battles raging near the towns of datu saudi ampatuan and datu piang all in maguindanao province
7256760 we have done our best to embrace peace but the milf started the hostilities by pillaging villages and murdering innocent civilians in mindanao
7256761 now we are implementing the full force of the law and we will arrest those responsible for the traitorous attacks against civilians
7256762 this is a grim scenario and i dont even want to think about it but if the peace talks collapse then there will be war again in mindanao
7256763 the voice of reason is dwarfed by the voice of hatred and prejudice

7256772 you need microsofts crazy expensive exchange servers ive seen figures of 50 000 for a business with say 25 remote employees and thats without adding in all the attendant nickel and dime licenses and arcane yet costly issues that crop up with remote connectivity
7256773 small businesses that do lots of calculations should stay away excel on the mac is just awful visual basic script is amazingly not entirely supported nor are the powerful pivot tables found in excel running on a pc and considering how fabulous excel 2007 is i consider the 64 bit incarnation of that program the best thing to happen to spreadsheets since the spreadsheet there is no reason for quants to mess with macs
7256774 everybody keeps talking about the mac over a pc and all this other stuff but in hindsite where do you think mac got its ideas from it certainly wasnt a brainchild from its ceo

7256779 a permanent repeal would cost 522 billion in lost tax revenue over the next decade according to the treasury departments evaluation of president bushs 2009 budget proposals
7256780 i agree with obama and mccain that the estate tax should not be repealed i also accept obamas exemption of 3 5 million but a tax rate above that amount at 45 is too high i believe the tax rate on estates above the 3 5 million should be lower like at 25 i think that mccains exemption of 5 million is too high and his suggested tax rate of 15 is too low finally i hope estate tax law continues to establish a new basis market values of the assets for the inherited assets at the date of death
7256781 the estate tax is taxation on assets that have already been taxed under the income tax laws
7256782 i couldnt disagree more the estate tax is one of the oldest taxes put in place by the found fathers of our country it was designed to prevent people from passing on vast sums of wealth thus creating an american aristocracy
7256783 the only way to increase revenue to the government is to reduce taxation
7256784 we got to the point where we didnt know why we were doing it anymore

7256808 dit is wat je wilt h een lieve knuffel van een lieve jongen die nooit ophoud
7256809 zelfs al heb je verkering en heb je een relatie je moet elkaar altijd de ruimte geven om andere dingen te doen en een eigen leven te leiden het mag niet zo zijn dat de relatie verstikkend werkt voor jullie allebei dan mag hij nog zo lief en aardig en behulpzaam zijn hij mag je niet gaan opeisen jij hebt je vriendinnen je school en allerlei andere hobbies en het klinkt hard en gemeen maar die dingen zullen waarschijnlijk langer meegaan dan je eerste vriendje het is zonde om voor je eerste vriendje alles op te geven wat je verder nog hebt ik wil niet hard klinken maar je moet altijd en overal achter je leven blijven staan geen enkele jongen ter wereld is het waard dat je zomaar alles voor hem opgeeft geen enkele jongen ter wereld heeft het recht van alles van je te eisen en een jongen die denkt dat hij dat wel kan en mag doen is je niet waard pas als je iemand hebt gevonden die van je houdt om wie je bent wat je doet en wat je wil zijn kan een relatie echt werken pas als je iemand hebt gevonden die je leven met je wil delen maar niet je leven wil zijn dan pas is een jongen het waard om voor te gaan je past pas echt bij elkaar als je jullie leven wil vermengen ze moeten niet helemaal n worden ieder mens heeft nu eenmaal negatieve en positieve eigenschappen pas als je van elkaar alle eigenschappen kan accepteren is het verstandig met een relatie door te gaan op het moment dat je gaat twijfelen aan een relatie en je gaat ergeren aan allerlei dingen wordt het tijd er een punt achter te zetten je kan altijd kijken of er daarna dingen veranderen maar je moet nooit iets blijven volhouden puur en alleen om het vol te houden en ik weet honder procent zeker dat er ergens op deze wereld een jongen rondloopt die perfect bij je past een jongen die je en al zijn liefde geeft en de ruimte geeft om jezelf te blijven een jongen die je echt voor de volle honder procent verdient want ik geloof niets in deze wereld gebeurt zonder reden iets gebeurt omdat je er van moet leren van moet genieten en van moet blijven dromen samen met je vriendinnen de mensen die je echt kennen kun je zoeken naar dat leven wat jij wilt leiden een leven waar je je voor de volle honderd procent goed bij voelt en waar je gelukkig zult worden en ik weet zeker vroeg of laat vind je het ergens

7256815 the difference between successful people and failures is that successful people make a habit of doing the things that failures do not like to do
7256816 the law of cause and effect says that everything happens for a reason for every effect in your life there is a cause or series of specific measurable definable identifiable causes
7256817 the most wonderful part of this is that at any time you can start making different choices and different decisions taking different steps and you will inevitably arrive at a different place than where you are today
7256818 the greatest thinkers of all time going back to the earliest recorded writings of the earliest religions the earliest philosophers and metaphysical schools have all emphasized the power of the human mind to shape individual destinies
7256819 the key to your enjoying more of what people call luck is for you to engage in more of the actions that are more likely to bring about the consequences that you desire

7256837 ik persoonlijk benader het veelkleurige christelijke landschap dan ook positief zo veel mensen zo veel interpretaties en het een sluit het ander niet uit fantastisch dat we met 2 2 miljard christenen in de wereld uit zoveel verschillende kerken in die ene god geloven

7256844 nach unserer glaubens berzeugung ist vollst ndiges heil dort wo das apostelamt mit dem stammapostel in der heilsvermittelnden t tigkeit im auftrag und namen jesu t tig ist
7256845 um selig zu werden muss ich dann fr her oder sp ter neuapostolisch werden
7256846 wer in die volle gemeinschaft der kirche treten will muss in die gemeinschaft mit dem papst eintreten
7256847 ob uns das nun passt oder nicht sondern das m ssen wir zur kenntnis nehmen und m ssen es auch jeweils akzeptieren deshalb habe ich diese frage auch so gestellt
7256848 wenn ich als ziel die teilhabe an der wiederkunft jesu christi habe und glaube und bekenne dass daf r apostelwirksamkeit heilsvermittelnd ist dann muss ich ihre frage so beantworten wenn sie diese seligkeit meinen ja dann m ssen sie irgendwann neuapostolisch werden
7256849 wir wollen hier in der apostelnachfolge stehen weil es eben jesunachfolge ist

7256862 after examining the parallels between the theology of the trinity and the buddhist concept of interbeing the writer takes issue with the man regarded by millions as the foremost exponent of the christian tradition pope john paul ii
7256863 christ is absolutely original and absolutely unique if he were only a wise man like socrates if he were a prophet like mohammed if he were enlghtened like buddha without any doubt he would not be what he is he is the one mediator between god and humanity
7256864 this statement does not seen to reflect the deep mystery of the oneness of the trinity it also does not reflect the fact that christ is also the son of man all christians while praying to god address him as father of course christ is unique but who is not unique socrates mohammed the buddha you and i are all unique the idea behind the statement however is the notion that christianity provides the only way of salvation and all other religious traditions are of no use this attitude excludes dialogue and fosters religious intolerance and discrimination it does not help

7256878 dat het wel eens sneller kan gaan met de vrouw in het ambt in de nak dan wij denken
7256879 mijn mening is trouwens dat vrouwen gewoon een ambt moeten kunnen krijgen er is toch geen enkele reden meer te vinden waarom dat niet zou kunnen
7256880 omdat er bijna niemand s middags naar de kerk ging
7256881 concreet betekent dat dus voor een thema als vrouw in het ambt dat zoiets pas in de nak doorgevoerd wordt als dat ook acceptabel is voor de apostelen dienaren leden in het donkerste hoekje van donker afrika waar vrouwen alleen maar goed zijn om kinderen te krijgen te koken en voornamelijk hun waffel te houden
7256882 ik vind jouw uiting mbt donker afrika getuigen van een stuitende arrogantie en onwetendheid van een zich superieur wanende cultuur en ik vraag me af of je enig idee hebt van het respect dat vrouwen in veel natuurvolkeren bij hun mannen genieten en hoeveel wij ontnatuurde westerlingen van zulke volken kunnen leren

7256884 verder vind ik dat jij er in de discussie hier wat erg makkelijk overheen stapt dat er in het westen hoewel de positie van vrouwen in de westelijke wereld in het algemeen erg zelfstandig en gelijkwaardig aan de man is ook grote minderheden zijn waarbinnen dat niet geldt en dat m n in christelijke richtingen waaronder ook de nak waarin als het erop aan komt de conservatieven altijd nog de dienst uitmaken
7256885 je kunt daarom je aandacht wel richten op 8216 donker afrika 8217 maar geloof maar niet dat het westelijk deel van de nak zelf al klaar zou zijn voor vrouwen in het ambt
7256886 een goeie betaalde preek is beter dan een halve gratis preek
7256887 tevens blijkt dat er vrouwen zijn geweest met leidinggevende taken
7256888 indien het bestuur het advies had aangenomen van een wijze vrouw dan durf ik te stellen dat de situatie niet was ge scaleerd
7256889 ik zie dus geen enkel beletsel voor vrouwen in het priesterambt
7256890 dan durf ik te stellen dat de situatie niet was ge scaleerd
7256891 zij houdt dat het om zeer fundamentele redenen niet geoorloofd is vrouwen tot priester te wijden deze redenen omvatten het in de gewijde geschriften gegeven voorbeeld van christus die zijn apostelen alleen uit mannen koos de bestendige praktijk van de kerk welke in navolging van christus alleen mannen heeft gekozen en haar levende leergezag dat zichzelf gelijkblijvend heeft gehouden dat het uitsluiten van vrouwen van het priesterschap in overeenstemming is met het plan van god aangaande zijn kerk
7256892 zichzelf niet beschouwt als het gezag dat vrouwen toe kan laten tot de priesterwijding
7256893 is de ware reden dat christus het zo beschikt heeft toen hij de kerk haar fundamentele constitutie heeft gegeven en de theologische antropologie die daarna steeds door de traditie van deze zelfde kerk in acht genomen is
7256894 toen christus immers alleen mannen als zijn apostelen riep heeft hij op geheel vrije en soevereine wijze gehandeld hij heeft dat met dezelfde vrijheid gedaan waarmee hij in zijn gehele houding de waardigheid en de roeping van de vrouw heeft doen uitkomen zonder zich te conformeren aan de heersende gewoonte en aan de traditie die ook door de wetgeving van de tijd gesanctioneerd was
7256895 onze moeder de heilige kerk wenst vurig dat de christelijke vrouwen zich ten volle bewust worden hoe groot haar zending is haar taak is vandaag van het grootste belang opdat de samenleving tegelijk en vernieuwd en menselijker wordt en de gelovigen het ware beeld van de kerk ontdekken
7256896 de kerk heeft inderdaad de waardigheid en de roeping van de vrouw verdedigd en lof en dank uitgedrukt voor de vrouwen die trouw aan het evangelie in iedere tijd deelgenomen hebben aan de apostolische zending van heel het volk gods het gaat om heilige martelaressen maagden moeders van gezinnen die moedig getuigd hebben van hun geloof en door hun kinderen in de geest van het evangelie op te voeden het geloof en de traditie van de kerk hebben doorgegeven
7256897 het ene betere charisma waarnaar iemand kan en moet streven de liefde is vgl 1 kor 12 13 de grootsten in het rijk der hemelen zijn niet de ambtsdragers maar de heiligen
7256898 je zult niet in de dienst zijn bij zijn wederkomst
7256899 bij het leren luisteren wij alleen naar onze eigen gedachten daarom kunnen we geen nieuwe gedachten horen tenzij wij volgens nieuwe methoden leren luisteren en studeren
7256900 de mens is niets anders dan dat hij van zichzelf maakt de verantwoordelijkheid is niet alleen voor jezelf maar voor alle mensen onze verantwoordelijkheid omvat dus de hele wereld
7256901 sartre weigert dus te erkennen dat de mens een beetje vrij en tegelijkertijd een beetje slaaf kan zijn
7256902 veeleer lijkt elke gebeurtenis te zijn overgedtermineerd blijkt ze de resultante te zijn van verscheidene convergerende oorzaken
7256903 als ik weet dat ik morgen zal sterven plant ik vandaag nog een boom
7256904 vanuit internationale zijde heeft u wel een positieve reactie ontvangen namelijk een uitnodiging voor een dialoog
7256905 een uitzondering is niet altijd een bevestiging van de bestaande regel het kan ook de voorbode van een nieuwe regel zijn
7256906 godskinderen verlaten het huis des heren niet zo zeer uit ongeloof maar omdat zei zich geergerd hebben
7256907 de kerk is alleen een transformatorhuisje dat de krachtstroom van de man die daar in palestina in het zand schreef eerlijk verdeelt maar wat hebben ze ervan gemaakt
7256908 als jij nou d ap was hoe zou jij dan dit en dat regelen
7256909 wie dit ambt begeert weet niet wat het inhoudt of hij is ziek
7256910 dat het alleen rang was als er rang op stond
7256911 in de huidige tijd kunnen wij hier in west europa en vele andere gebieden op de wereld toch wel zeggen dat de vrouw minimaal gelijk is aan de man hoe kan ik het verkopen aan de buitenwereld dat er geen vrouwelijke ambten zijn in de nak hoe kan ik het mezelf verkopen
7256912 tjerk ik let wel op zoals je ziet heb je niets anders te doen dan complete bijbelhoofdstukken te knippen en te plakken denk je echt dat ik in mijn schaarse vrije tijd waarin ik dit forum o a probeer te volgen die ellenlange stukken ga lezen probeer eens een duidelijk punt te maken
7256913 kom eens met jouw opsomming van veranderingen die allemaal nodig zijn en als deze zouden worden doorgevoerd wat zou dat voor jou voor betekenis hebben
7256914 alle leden van de nieuw apostolische kerk hebben recht op persoonlijke zielzorg daartoe behoren persoonlijke gesprekken over geloofs en levensvragen evenals steun in bijzondere levensomstandigheden zieken en ouderen worden in zieken en verzorgingstehuizen regelmatig door hun zielverzorgers bezocht
7256915 ongetwijfeld dragen wij als beroepsgroep ook bij tot het agressieve gedrag van onze pati nten het is soms heel goed voorstelbaar dat ons soms hautain en niet altijd op de problemen van de pati nt gericht gedrag een onbeheerste primaire reactie oproept
7256916 de ongeschreven regel dat binnen de arts pati nt relatie gezonde kritiek en bij elke werksituatie behorende kwaadheid op elkaar niet is toegestaan
7256917 het positieve van een weblog als deze is dat er verschillende meningen kunnen worden ingebracht en dat ze in volgorde van binnenkomst blijven staan leesbaar voor een ieder die zich van de discussie achteraf een beeld wil vormen
7256918 dat het alleen rang was als er rang op stond
7256919 luister in ieder geval ook naar de andere partij voordat je oordeelt
7256920 dit is het laatste vers ezechi l 31 18 v g uit de log van ap sepers zie boven mischien moet je er over nadenken of dit niet over jou gaat heb ik voor mezelf ook over nagedacht
7256921 als iemand jou daarvan anoniem verdenkt kun je ervan uitgaan dat zeker 100 anderen het k vinden zou het je gewoon openlijk recht in je gezicht zijn aangezegd dan zou ik uitgaan van 50 anderen
7256922 als ik weet dat ik morgen zal sterven plant ik vandaag nog een boom
7256923 dienende broeders dienen dienstbaar te willen zijn aan de gemeente van christus
7256924 innerlijk moet jij een echte scheiding aangebracht hebben tussen persoonlijk geloof en de kerk
7256925 daarbij moet ik verklaren dat ik altijd veel troost heb kunnen putten uit literatuur en poezie zoals de bijbel
7256926 ik zal je even laten zien wat je moeder en ik vanochtend lazen in de bijbel
7256927 als je iets hoort dan wel leest geheel onverwachts dat je overtuiging hoop en verlangen in n klap voor langere tijd verzadigd wordt dat in een fractie van de tijd de eigen levensinhoud verlicht en van rijke zin voorzien wordt dan is er sprake van een ruggesteun die vele zorgen en tegenslagen teniet doet
7256928 hoe moet ik dit zien als een club schijnheiligen met een scheef hoofd en een bijbel onder de armen
7256929 maar zou het niet zo kunnen zijn dat je bepaalde kwesties begon te doorzien zodat het slechts schijn was dat de geborgenheid van vroeger re el was
7256930 vergelijk het met een trein op een station op een gegeven moment weet je niet of het jouw trein is die vooruit gaat of de andere trein die achteruit gaat
7256931 wat zijn authentieke mensen gaf jij jou stem aan onmondigen
7256932 welluidendheid literatuur die dat niet was voor mij las ik niet heelheid daar zoek ik nog steeds naar
7256933 dienende broeders veranderden in edelachtbaren hoogvliegers onder hen werden brokkenpiloten broers en zussen in de gemeente van christus toonden zich als gedienstigen van de gevestigde orde de zegen bleef uit evenals de zege
7256934 het zou een klein geloof zijn indien het in woorden kan worden gekleed
7256935 bij elke deur waar ik in mijn leven doorheen ga wil ik graag dat god mij kan voorgaan
7256936 het zwart witte komt allemaal door die stellingen door woorden die ons hypnotiseren
7256937 wat mij bijvoorbeeld verbaast is dat mensen aan het gedrag kunnen aflezen wat iemand wilt en wat iemand bezig houdt er zou wat dat betreft een leerstelling geformuleerd kunnen worden dat we niet zo lichtzinnig moeten oordelen en niet al te snel naar het handvat van een conclusie moeten grijpen
7256938 en nu denkt u zeker dat dit duidelijk handelt over de persoon naast u
7256939 jezus is er volgens mij nooit op uitgeweest om een stelsel met starre leerstellingen na te laten
7256940 en nu denkt u zeker dat dit duidelijk handelt over de persoon naast u
7256941 deze hoogleraar doelde waarschijnlijk op zichzelf wel er goed over kunnen praten maar niet
7256942 was ik maar niet van de kerkvorst dan zou ik niet zo vaak hoeven te reizen en lekker in de kast kunnen hangen
7256943 als jullie serieus zijn komt er een forum bij de nak site
7256944 want de heer is de geest en waar de geest des heren is daar is vrijheid
7256945 ik zal mijn wet in hun hart geven en in hun binnenste schrijven en zij zullen mijn volk zijn en ik zal hun god zijn
7256946 als de profetie ophoudt wordt het volk wild en woest welgelukzalig echter degene die de wet handhaaft
7256947 gij zult god uw heer liefhebben met u ganse hart en met uw ganse ziel en met geheel uw verstand
7256948 naarmate je gevoelens van verbondenheid groter worden met een kerk met een democratie dan ga je steeds meer de gedachten uitdragen die in overeenstemming zijn met het belang van het geheel
7256949 ik weet niet wat de trui gedacht heeft maar hij reed daar wel rond
7256950 logica brengt je van a naar b fantasie brengt je overal
7256951 ik verhaalde onlangs over de in tongen sprekende mensen van een ander geloof daar schrok ik van
7256952 maar ook in het dagelijkse leven hoe niets ontziend mensen zijn om een zaak te dienen
7256953 hoe het binnen een kerkelijke structuur zit ik weet het niet daar schijn jij een uitgesprokener mening over te hebben
7256954 in hoeverre is het in het werk des heren nodig dat sommigen zich geroepen voelen om
7256955 geroepen voelen om namens de kerk te spreken wat bedoel je
7256956 als je een ambt gekregen hebt dan heb je in feite de opdracht gekregen
7256957 we concentrate on reading in this class your child will not have a successful academic career if he or she cannot read well
7256958 the pain that her family and her friends are feeling right now is indescribable
7256959 she was always laughing smiling hugging everyone she was loved by the girls as well as the boys a super soccer player just beautiful
7256960 she took 24 triple c pills the new high for teenagers triple c is a slang term for plain old cough and cold medicine she was not angry unhappy or anything else she just wanted to get high and heard this was a fun and easy way to do it
7256961 when she began vomiting the next morning and couldnt stop her parents took her to the hospital
7256962 for four days test after test was done to figure out what was wrong still no one said anything then she slipped into a coma and was given last rites her liver had completely failed she was 16

7256976 in the name of the greenhouse effect some environmentalists are demanding a 30 percent rollback in c02 emissions by the year 2000
7256977 we dont know enough not to make a catastrophic mistake in dealing with the worlds climate
7256978 the state which separates its scholars from its warriors will have its thinking done by cowards and its fighting done by fools
7256979 i hope you know youre a very cool girl whether youre in the cool group or the popular group or the whatever group
7256980 well to get into the cool group you have to you know be cool and you have to dress cool you have to own 10 roxy things and 10 limited too things
7256981 emma her other best friend and i are thinking about starting our own group
7256982 ik geloof dat de heer jezus zijn kerk door levende apostelen regeert tot aan zijn wederkomst dat hij zijn apostelen gezonden heeft en nog zendt met de opdracht te onderwijzen in zijn naam zonden te vergeven en met water en de heilige geest te dopen
7256983 ik geloof dat de met water gedoopte zielen door een apostel de heilige geest moeten ontvangen ter verkrijging van het kindschap gods waardoor zij als leden aan het lichaam van christus worden opgenomen
7256984 we kennen als kerk een bepaalde exclusiviteit bijzonderheid welke moet leiden tot inclusiviteit
7256985 reeds afgelopen jaren is het mij meermalen opgevallen dat bijvoorbeeld veranderingen in de kerkleer weinig tot geen mensen bezighield te denken valt aan veranderingen in de sleutelmacht en de materie rondom het martelaarschap in relatie tot de eerste opstanding
7256986 waar maken jullie je toch druk om het belangrijkste woord wat jezus gaf was en is
7256987 pos heeft zich in de negentiger jaren eveneens bediend van mijn directe bloedverwanten teneinde mij in de houding te zetten
7256988 gegen die lehre ein betreiben solcher einrichtungen wird als pflege des leibes und deshalb als weltlich betrachtet
7256989 eine gro e zahl meiner rundschreiben an die leiter und diener der nak in deutschland lieferte den beweis da sie uneingeschr nkt und bedingungslos die nationalsozialistische bewegung nicht nur anerkannt sondern auch gef rdert hat
7256990 jeder diener und jedes mitglied der neuapostolischen gemeinde ist durch die planm ige beeinflussung seitens der hauptleitung in nationalsozialistischem sinn erzogen so da die meisten mitglieder der neuapostolischen gemeinde der nsdap angeh ren oder ihr nahestehen
7256991 massiven unterst tzung des regimes der ddr bis zum ende seines bestehens
7256992 die situation in unseren gemeinden ist stabil es kommen nicht nur alte sondern menschen in jedem alter neu zu uns aus der spiegel 30 10 95
7256993 helemaal niet als je breedsprakig met het woordenboek op de schoot de moraalridder gaat uithangen
7256994 dap pos heeft zich in de negentiger jaren eveneens bediend van mijn directe bloedverwanten teneinde mij in de houding te zetten mans gestapo praktijken dienen blijkbaar als voorbeeld voor de huidige nak leiding
7256995 wat wilt u mij nu toch duidelijk maken wat wilt u van mij
7256996 wie geen fouten maakt heeft waarschijnlijk nog nooit achterom gekeken
7256997 wie niet van het verleden wenst te leren is gedoemd weer dezelfde fouten te maken
7256998 dit is bestemd voor god dat voor mijzelf dit voor mijn ziel en dat voor mijn lichaam
7256999 mischien samen mischien een vriendschappelijk naast elkaar i p v samen
7257000 tegen ongerechtigheid kun je je weren tegen domheid is geen kruid gewassen
7257001 vader vergeef het hun want ze weten niet wat ze doen
7257002 kirche im vollsinn ist nur dort anwesend wo lebendige apostel sind
7257003 wanneer je de diensten bezoekt pik eruit wat je kunt gebruiken
7257004 je eigen mening boven die van de nak zetten alleen pakken waar je zin in hebt
7257005 john orr john orr john orr to the rescue john orr
7257006 jump in the car your piano class starts in three minutes
7257007 hoewel ik goed begrijp dat lezers en schrijvers bepaalde diep gelegen frustraties hebben die zij nooit goed konden kanaliseren
7257008 want ik kan me echt niet voorstellen dat als de nak haar standpunt inzake exclusiviteit aanpast dat dan ineens alles anders is
7257009 vrede vrede geen gevaar slaap maar lekker rust maar zacht de apostel houdt de wacht
7257010 wat een boel lege banken waar is iedereen toch gebleven
7257011 kom eens met jouw opsomming van veranderingen die allemaal nodig zijn en als deze zouden worden doorgevoerd wat zou dat voor jou voor betekenis hebben
7257012 ik houd zielsveel van mijn vrouw het is d vrouw voor mij ze is werkelijk de liefst vrouw op aarde
7257013 als je naar buiten kijkt zie je dat alles niet zo maar toeval is
7257014 ik bewonder de serene zelfverzekerdheid van hen die geloven het is een prachtig iets om het kalme zelfvertrouwen gade te slaan van een christen met vier azen in zijn hand
7257015 het is veel eenvoudiger kritiek te leveren dan het bij het rechte eind te hebben
7257016 indien u kunt aantonen dat het tot een zinvolle uitwisseling van idee n en gedachten kan leiden dan wil ik wel discussi ren
7257017 het is altijd moeilijk om over een onderwerp dat zo gevoelig ligt als het geloof met elkaar van gedachten te wisselen
7257018 als alle wetenschappelijke problemen zijn opgelost zijn onze persoonlijke problemen niet eens aangeroerd
7257019 dat het toch wel jammer is dat het tegenwoordig zo moet
7257020 wetenschap en geloof staan los van elkaar en liggen naar mijn idee ook niet in elkaars verlengde
7257021 wat een zootje ze luisteren niet eens naar mijn argumenten
7257022 ik vind de nak een radicale kerk en ik vind dat je dit best op een harde wijze mag bestrijden
7257023 natuurlijk zijn er oprechte mensen maar dat zegt toch niets over het geloof dat ze belijden en waarom moet ik god er buiten laten
7257024 opnieuw bevestigd dat de bijbel als religieuze grondslag van de leer van de nieuw apostolische kerk erkend en beschouwd wordt
7257025 maar ik vind juist dat een kerk die denkt dat zij het uitverkoren volk is en daarmee de rest van de mensheid beschouwt als onverlost neerkijkt op
7257026 okay dan zijn we het dus op dit punt eens
7257027 ik heb zo veel armoede gezien ik word onwel in deze wereld van overvloed
7257028 maar ook had ik vroeger graag gehoord dat in ned tijdelijk twee offici le kerken hebben bestaan die beiden de st ap erkenden ik spreek niet eens een waardeoordeel uit over al die zaken maar ik vind dat de kerk daar eerlijk en open over moet zijn
7257029 maar het is wel goed om te weten dat ik niet met de nak ben gestopt vanwege
7257030 in het geloof gaat het mij om de kerk van de zaak
7257031 als alle bloemen rood waren wat zou het dan een saaie bedoening zijn zeg
7257032 wil je mensen vergelijken met bloemen dan in dit geval
7257033 ik bedoel schrijven kan ik niet zo goed maar ik weet wel waar mijn hart zit
7257034 deze discussie hoe zinvol ook gaat niet over het ware geloof van de losse deelnemers het gaat over standpunten van de nak die je kunt kunt bekritiseren dmv van argumenten en door beredeneren
7257035 fanatiekelingen ontlenen hun bewegingsvrijheid aan plaatselijke na velingen zo werkt dat
7257036 standpunten van de nak bekritiseren dmv van argumenten en door beredeneren
7257037 ik vind de nak een radicale kerk en ik vind dat je dit best op een harde wijze mag bestrijden
7257038 wie iets niet in begrijpelijke taal kan uitleggen aan een 13 jarige snapt het zelf niet dit geldt voor de quantummechanica en noem het maar op
7257039 hoe denk je bv over de excluviteitsgedachte van de nak
7257040 ik ben getrouwd met het meisje dat ik het liefste wou n et met de kerk
7257041 over de noodzakelijkheid over de afdracht van de heilige geest door een apostel
7257042 over het idee dat nakers denken later als koningen en priesters werkzaam te zullen zijn
7257043 over het feit dat gerrit sepers de kerk heeft verlaten
7257044 hoe zie jij iets waar de mond van vol is
7257045 wie aan n van mijn kinderen komt komt aan mij
7257046 als je slim bent wens je wanneer je een vallende ster ziet dat je drie wensen mag doen bij de derde wens wens je hetzelfde opnieuw
7257047 bij de bruiloft des lams zullen allen even dicht bij jezus zijn
7257048 je haalt aan dat het geloof mensen niet aan te praten is is dat een vanzelfsprekendheid
7257049 toch kan niemand bij mij komen tenzij de vader die mij gezonden heeft hem bij me brengt en ik zal hem op de laatste dag tot leven wekken
7257050 ik zou wel christen willen zijn maar dan moesten ze er wat verloster uitzien
7257051 mensen die altijd anderen citeren hebben zeker zelf niet veel te zeggen
7257052 grootheden citeren heeft ook met bescheidenheid te maken dat ik sommige dingen zelf niet zo treffend kan verwoorden en ze hebben meer autoriteit enz enz
7257053 misschien kunt u met uw en mijn reactie een ander helpen namelijk om het volgende na te streven 1 om de apostolische boodschap op idealistische wijze in uw hart te blijven dragen en uit te dragen temidden van de algemene christenheid 2 om op een realistische wijze om te gaan met onze eigen geschiedenis en daar ook consequenties voor u zelf aan te verbinden 3 om de diepere waarden van het jodendom te onderkennen
7257054 ik begrijp dus niet zo goed dat mensen soms zo hoog van de toren blazen alsof het beloop van de dingen zal wisselen op hun wenken
7257055 het geloof is voor mij niet de uitkomst van een rekensom maar het resultaat van intense gevoelens in verbondenheid met
7257056 p s ik had geen tijd om dit verhaal in te korten
7257057 steeds vaker tegenwoordig hoor je in de tweede kamer mensen zich uitdrukken in krachttermen ze zeggen dan bijvoorbeeld dat ze hevig verontwaardigd zijn en het ergens volstrekt mee oneens maar wanneer ik dan naar de gezichten kijk denk ik dat valt nog wel mee ikzelf zou in zon geval liever hebben opgemerkt kan het niet wat anders
7257058 zoals ik al zei morgen haal je andere liederen aan je knipt wat filmmateriaal weg en hupsakee grondvesten en artikelen staan er vandaag en morgen weer
7257059 zou jij wel een ambt willen hebben in de kerk
7257060 al bij de zondagschool vond ik het telkens moeilijk om de kinderen echt wat te vertellen het is niet alleen een geschiedenislesje het gaat er niet om om een uur vol te kunnen kletsen nee op een ambt zit ik zeker niet te wachten
7257061 en wat was die kern van de zaak ook alweer
7257062 noteert u het even morgen vind hier een onverwacht opgegeven schriftelijk overhorinkje plaats
7257063 al dat rumoer heeft ook een gevaarlijke kant het kan de aandacht afleiden van waar het eigenlijk om gaat dat wezenlijke krijgt ook vanuit de kerkleiding weinig aandacht
7257064 het gaat namelijk om hulp aan zielen die in hun aardse leven zijn verkocht verraden vernederd verkracht en afgeslacht er wacht verlossingsarbeid aan mensen die geestelijk kapot zijn gemaakt door drank en drugs er moet licht worden gebracht bij hen aan wie het levenslicht niet was gegund er moet liefde worden bewezen aan hen die in hun aardse bestaan nooit zijn liefgehad aan mensen die door dictators en terroristen de dood zijn ingejaagd moet in hun eigen belang worden geleerd weer een beetje genuanceerd te denken
7257065 aan de kerkleiding vraag ik daarom de conseguenties te aanvaarden van haar eigen leer en de toebereiding van haar leden niet te beperken tot de wederkomst van christus maar helderheid te verschaffen over de gigantische en moeilijke taken die de apostolische christenen als toekomstige koningen en priesters wachten
7257066 ga gerust door met de discussie ook op het internet blijf op zoek naar de waarheid maar vergeet intussen niet te worden als jezus dat heeft de allerhoogste prioriteit
7257067 of de een wel of niet vaker moet zeggen wat de ander denkt
7257068 het enigma van de literatuur ontstaat bij de overgang van de gesproken naar de geschreven taal
7257069 dankzij de bijdrage van de vage gast realiseer ik mij weer waarom ik de kerk heb verlaten dat eeuwige dom houden van mensen hetgeen zeer tegen mijn gevoel indruiste de tekst van jesus sirach is daar een treffend voorbeeld van ik zal zo als tegenhanger een stuk plaatsen van imanuel kant wat is verlichting
7257070 fanatiekelingen ontlenen hun bewegingsvrijheid aan plaatselijke na velingen zo werkt dat
7257071 maar ben je het wel met mij eens dat in een aantal verzen de mens wordt aangeraden vooral niet teveel na te gaan denken
7257072 welnu met de heer wordt de geest bedoeld en waar de geest van de heer is daar is vrijheid
7257073 serieus een kerk denkt niet laten we het denken maar aan onszelf overlaten maar wij zijn god niet al denken sommigen van wel
7257074 concreet wat is je idee m b t de verlichting en de nieuw apostolische kerk
7257075 maar deze site is toch met name nak gerelateerd en in die kerk wordt het apostelambt toch juist een absolute autoriteit toegekend jezuswoord is apostelwoord
7257076 al met al lijkt het mij in de structuur en de geest van de nak niet eenvoudig om zelfstandig te denken
7257077 ik vind de nak een radicale kerk en ik vind dat je dit best op een harde wijze mag bestrijden
7257078 nogmaals met mijn nijdigheid valt het wel mee hoor het heeft ook veel goeds gebracht
7257079 ikzelf heb k kritiek voornamelijk het idee dat er in een kerk een religieuze organisatie een soort hoger geweten wordt uitgebroed een presidium komt bijeen de een of andere gekleurde rook stijgt op en vervolgens horen de leden waar men zich nog verder aan moet houden
7257080 dankzij de bijdrage van de vage gast realiseer ik mij weer waarom ik de kerk heb verlaten dat eeuwige dom houden van mensen hetgeen zeer tegen mijn gevoel indruiste de tekst van jesus sirach is daar een treffend voorbeeld van ik zal zo als tegenhanger een stuk plaatsen van imanuel kant wat is verlichting
7257081 een fout van de zogenaamde verlichting zij schenkt de mens een illusie van objectiviteit terwijl zijn subjectiviteit blijft bestaan
7257082 allerlei fanatiekelingen zij waren naar mijn idee ook gevangen in een systeem
7257083 dus wij gaan nog wel naar de diensten beleven daar meestal ook fijne en bevestigende momenten maar wanneer iets niet goed voelt of men in onze ogen helemaal de plank mis slaat durven wij dat ook te erkennen en hierover te spreken
7257084 maar persoonlijk lijkt het mij erg lastig om de dogmatische kerkleer hierbij terzijde de schuiven
7257085 maar leer ik het dan wel uit de juiste bijbelvertaling anders zul je het beleven dat ik over vier jaar weer opnieuw kan beginnen
7257086 het enige protocol wat er voor mij persoonlijk in het geloof toe doet ontleen ik aan het volgende
7257087 ook ben ik benieuwd naar hoe de volgende leden de brieven inzake het st ap bezoek ervaren ik vind het nogal slijmerig eerlijk gezegd in een paar zinnen werden zowel de oude als de nieuwe st ap en pos een veer in de
7257088 waarom durft toch niemand onder zijn eigen naam te schrijven
7257089 ach wat helpen vorm en namen had ik uwe zalving niet
7257090 vage gast betekent je reactie dat je de brief ook niet wil ondertekenen
7257091 ik geniet van de geestelijke muziek maar kan het niet meer opbrengen om naar de nak te gaan daar wordt teveel los gemaakt wat niet had mogen gebeuren
7257092 ik denk dat vele mensen willen geloven en niets met allerlei gehannes te maken willen hebben als ik zo vrij mag zijn voor anderen te spreken
7257093 god door wie u geroepen bent om n te zijn met zijn zoon jezus christus onze heer is trouw
7257094 mag die weg soms moeilijk gaan op het einddoel komt het aan
7257095 m b t de brief van de bruijn kan het zijn dat hij steun zoekt bij leber vanwege de zorgwekkende positie van nak nederland
7257096 de bruijn zal zijn hart best op de juiste plek hebben maar persoonlijk vind ik het niet zo slim om een dergelijke brief te schrijven
7257097 het valt niet mee om het iedereen naar de zin te maken
7257098 ga niet met anderen om zoals u wilt dat anderen met u zouden omgaan doch probeer dezen te behandelen zoals men zelf wenst behandeld te worden
7257099 en trouwens wie zegt dat god liefde is god heeft adam en eva bij het minste en geringste het paradijs uitgebonjourd
7257100 de letter is dood maar de geest maakt levend heet het ergens als de kerk continu met artikelen wetten verboden en geboden schermt lijkt het mij een dode bedoeling
7257101 want niemand kan daar iemand volgen het is een verborgen route die men zelf slechts gaandeweg kan ontdekken maar dit pad leidt naar een mooie plaats waar het meest re le thuisgevoel gevonden wordt en als iemand deze plek aanschouwd heeft is het niet meer moeilijk om het uiterlijke vertoon op de juiste waarde te schatten
7257102 helaas heb ik moeten constateren dat zinnige discussies nauwelijks of niet kunnen plaatsvinden waarschijnlijk is de taal vooral als die vlug en onnauwkeurig wordt gebruikt een bron van dubbelzinnigheid en irritatie
7257103 indien er weer wat constructie en wil tot ontwikkeling is waar te nemen keer ik misschien terug tot die tijd zal ik ten hoogste als lezer terugkeren
7257104 koning priesterschap in christus vrederijk is niet hemels romantisch iedereen zal met inzet van hart en ziel moeten vechten om miljarden tot op het bot teleurgestelde zielen weer enigszins redelijk te leren denken
7257105 vervolgens stelde ik dat onze deelname aan de eerste opstanding niet vanuit de bijbel kan worden onderbouwd
7257106 het zijn de zielen van hen die onthoofd waren omdat ze van jezus hadden getuigd en over god hadden gesproken zij waren tot leven gekomen en heersten duizend jaar lang samen met de messias de andere doden kwamen niet tot leven voordat de duizend jaar voorbij waren dit is de eerste opstanding
7257107 terecht wijst de schrijver erop waarom het werkelijk binnen deze kerk om gaat dat betekent niet dat ik zijn standpunten geheel en al deel
7257108 denk je dat bijbelpassages zo letterlijk opgevat moeten worden dat er kerkelijke statuten op gebaseerd worden en toekomst perspectieven aan vast geknoopt moeten worden
7257109 ik ga over jezus vertellen want zon oud verhaal kent vast niemand dan zeg ik beste klasgenoten en juf jezus was een heel bijzondere man
7257110 maar begrijp jij waarom kerkelijke instituten er statuten op na houden belijdenissen en dergelijke
7257111 ik denk dat we het beter anders kunnen afspreken zodra we wat we gisteren lazen in de praktijk kunnen brengen lezen we verder
7257112 het zou bedoeld kunnen zijn om een kader te hebben voor de identiteit van een organisatie en als men erin zou slagen om het evangelie op die manier aansprekend samen te vatten is het waarschijnlijk toch wel dienstig alleen zodra je met dergelijke uitwijdingen op het verkeerde been wordt gezet mist het zijn doel niet voor niets worden zulke documenten telkens ook weer herzien je zult maar jarenlang over n onbegrijpelijk woord gestruikeld zijn dat vervolgens met terugwerkende kracht wordt geschrapt
7257113 matte s 5 17 denk niet dat ik gekomen ben om de wet of de profeten af te schaffen
7257114 idee n hebben de tijd nodig om tot rijpheid te komen arbeid die vruchteloos lijkt kan een kostbaar bezit vormen voor latere geslachten en zelfs op de ru nes van verwoeste beschavingen heeft telkens opnieuw een volgende generatie zich een veilige woonplaats gebouwd ook voor wie de toekomst met zorg tegemoet ziet blijft de plicht van deze dag duidelijk met inzet van al zijn krachtenhet recht en de waarheid te helpen vestigen
7257115 there is no god but god and muhammad is his prophet
7257116 we increasingly see that people around the world are flocking toward a main focal point that is the almighty god
7257117 the world as a whole now has more people with traditional religious views than ever before and they constitute a growing proportion of the worlds population
7257118 most arabs polled said that they wanted the clergy to play a bigger role in politics
7257119 wij horen niet bij de wijkers maar geloven en worden daarom niet verdoemd
7257120 niet alleen in de maatschappij maar ook binnen de gelovigen
7257121 we werden toegelaten maar mochten niet naar het h a en waren verstoken van elke vorm van zielezorg
7257122 we werden toegelaten maar mochten niet naar het h a en waren verstoken van elke vorm van zielezorg
7257123 je kan pas echt oordelen dat doe je als je alle feiten op een rijtje zet
7257124 hij heeft tot op heden nooit met n woord iets negatiefs gezegd over wat hem en ons is overkomen
7257125 maar ik ben voornamelijk boos over het systeem van de nieuw apostolische kerk totalitaire absolute religies maken per definitie slachtoffers zo ook de kerkleer van de nieuw apostolische kerk
7257126 wat je ook hebt meegemaakt waarom geeft dat recht van spreken over nieuwe andere situaties
7257127 dat is nou jammer zeg had je er maar bij gezet of zo dan had ik het goed kunnen rekenen
7257128 ergens zijn hier communicatie stoornissen beide kanten dan kun je in het geheel niet alleen de n a k ter verantwoording roepen
7257129 zou het niet verstandig zijn om de gehele materie leeuwarden te laten rusten en dit door de leiding van de nak in het onderdistrict leeuwarden te laten opknappen
7257130 mooi laten liggen al die gelovigen in geestesnood daar zijn wel andere mensen voor
7257131 ik vind het prijzenswaardig van mijn vader het in stilte ondergaan dat je genegeerd wordt en toch zon 15 jaar lang in weer en wind op je fietsje naar de gemeenschap gaan ik kon het niet
7257132 het is niet mijn bedoeling om iedereen uit nak hiermee over 1 kam te scheren
7257133 ik bij nu bijna 50 soms denk ik bij mezelf word het niet onderhand tijd de moed te hebben het estafettestokje over te nemen van hen die al zo lang mijn voorbeelden zijn
7257134 vage gast 31 juli 2005 00 01 in de thread
7257135 heer wat ben ik blij dat ik niet zo ben als hij
7257136 wat denken zij die zich voor de doden laten dopen te bereiken
7257137 wat je aan mijn minste gedaan hebt heb je aan mij gedaan
7257138 dan kun je vast oefenen als je mensen ontmoet die je niet zo makkelijk liggen
7257139 ik zou het zeer prettig vinden om te weten met wie ik van doen heb dat praat makkelijker ook als we elkaar nu nog onbewust in fysieke toestand zo hier en daar wel eens tegen het lijf zullen lopen
7257140 als dat helaas niet kan in sommige gemeenten ook in ons land
7257141 ik geloof dat ik gehoorzaamheid verschuldigd ben aan de wereldlijke overheid voor zover dit niet in strijd is met de goddelijke wetten

7257147 in het kind zijn ligt mijn macht en een kind mag ook wel eens moe zijn
7257148 wellicht heb veel geschreven echter het doet mij vreselijk pijn aan mijn hart dat je als afgedankt wordt beschouwd
7257149 ook diensten voor dienaren in ruste zijn kennelijk een taboe daarna net alsof je n et jaren mee hebt geholpen te bouwen aan gods werk en nooit zielszorg hebt helpen verrichten
7257150 ik lees regelmatig hier de discussie mee ik reageer niet altijd sommige zijn in mijn ogen geleerder om het te formuleren ik ben dan maar een simpele ziel die het niet echt kan

7257156 el aura dat ben jij ingo in je rode poloshirt
7257157 mamma mag ik nog es dat filmpje zien van toen ik orgel speelde
7257158 o dus dat wil je toch nog wel even zien
7257159 he mam tuurlijk vind ik je filmpjes ook heel leuk alleen niet als iemand staat te bidden
7257160 pa lla mamma heel lekker hoor heb ik laatst bij chte spanjaarden gegeten
7257161 nee dat is flauw pappa nou moet je ook iets terug zeggen
7257162 pa lla moet je uit n pan eten want dat doen de marokkanen ook nu zul je de moorse invloeden merken ingo veel hier is niet helemaal wat je denkt dat het is maar moors en toch ook weer niet omdat daarna de christenen er weer overheen gingen en v r de moren waren hier franken visigoten romeinen grieken en fenici rs de grieken overigens brachten de munt n de olijven daar tegenover staat dat de arabieren palmbomen introduceerden dus het is hier een mengelmoesje van jewelste hoor kun je het een beetje volgen
7257163 pa lla m k je rosa als een feest ter ere van de gasten
7257164 goed en waarom ben jij geen echte touareg niets is hier wat het lijkt
7257165 ik voel me niet zo lekker mam en pappa zit ook op de wc
7257166 ingo hoe zijn we daar toch terecht gekomen ik bedoel er waren toch veel meer restaurantjes
7257167 al toen we naar het strand liepen zwaaide ze naar mij en omdat pappa op de terugweg toch plassen moest ze deelde lollies uit heb je het niet gezien
7257168 weet jij hoe ik me de resterende tijd op mijn werk gedragen moet toon alsjeblieft
7257169 d r hebben planten problemen met water hier toch niet
7257170 het was een prima idee om ze ook nog mijn huis te laten zien m t de boom gabriella
7257171 un piso con un jard n hij moest er vreselijk om lachen alsof ik de makelaar was en zij de kopers en zij wist precies hoe ze het zeggen moest un piso con un jard n trots wel had ze blauw op haar lippen en aan haar rok maar in het album hadden ze alle drie veel plezier vooral de franco tijd ik met het ezeltje tussen de sinaasappelbomen en het strooien hoedje
7257172 ze wees op de foto eerst het irrigatie systeem aan
7257173 met verf aan haar vingers ik dacht dat ze schreef
7257174 en het werd tijd dat ik eens boven kwam we zijn de trap naar achter hoog gegaan en daarna voor en om het uitzicht op ons pleintje buiten binnen het grootouderlijk bed
7257175 we bespraken houtworm en de dragers van mijn ezel terwijl het beest allang vertrokken is toch zijn de amandels nog helemaal goed
7257176 en toen de verrassing mijn bananenplant is gaan bloeien drie vier meter hoog n grote oranje vlam messcherpe bloem die in zichzelf snijdt en een indigo blauw hart naar buiten tovert zo mooi
7257177 op het plaatsje achter en met een tros dat wil je niet weten gabriella jammer dat zij eerder weg moest
7257178 je wilt toch wel eens iets anders meemaken of niet dan
7257179 je moest de super in la duc a maar eens proberen
7257180 dat hoeft niet toon we zijn immers in het buitenland
7257181 quiero un pan con sal por favor quiero quiero un pan y koffiemelk en wat nog meer
7257182 het is de bedoeling dat zij het voor je doet we zijn in spanje
7257183 met een duik is hij even twee tellen uit zicht en dan weer niet
7257184 the traditional teaching of the church has proven to be the only failsafe way to prevent the spread of hiv aids
7257185 helaas heb ik moeten constateren dat zinnige discussies nauwelijks of niet kunnen plaatsvinden waarschijnlijk is de taal vooral als die vlug en onnauwkeurig wordt gebruikt een bron van dubbelzinnigheid en irritatie
7257186 deze gevoelens zoals wrok en antipathie teleurstelling en onbegrip houden het eigen leven in een metalen greep zodat niets meer beweegt niets meer stroomt
7257187 wil je het rijk gods leren kennen dan hoef je niet ver te zoeken of er voor te reizen het is heel dicht bij je als je wilt ja t is niet alleen bij je maar ook in je want ingetogenheid deemoed waarheid kuisheid en iedere deugd dat wil zeggen het ware godsrijk kan niemand van verre landen of van overzee halen maar het moet in zijn hart opbloeien daarom bidden wij niet lieve vader laat ons naar uw rijk toekomen alsof wij daarheen zouden kunnen lopen maar uw rijk kome tot ons
7257188 laten we met onze woorden boven de beperking van woorden uit stijgen
7257189 heeft u dit stuk tot deze regel doorgelezen wat vindt u er dan van
7257190 het probleem is juist dat we vaak jaren lang meestal onbewust onze eigen verantwoordelijkheid aan het instituut overgedragen hebben en dat wanneer we ons dat bewust worden en onze eigen verantwoordelijkheid gaan nemen we daarin vanuit de kerk niet gesteund worden integendeel vaak moet ik helaas zeggen het is daarom vaak een eenzame weg
7257191 ik ben zelf regelmatig op een kruispunt terecht gekomen waarbij de keuze het verloop van de komende tijd verregaand zou be nvloeden ik zie die momenten nog steeds voor me en sommige besluiten had ik wellicht anders genomen bij de huidige kennis van zaken
7257192 ik denk dat je door de invloeden van buitenaf gestuurd kan worden naar zowel keuzes die niet kloppen als keuzes die wel kloppen in het laatste geval kom je dus uit bij een keuze van binnenuit
7257193 de laatste tijd zijn er echter een aantal onderzoekers opgestaan die stellen dat de gevolgen van het toenemende lichaamsgewicht voor de volksgezondheid veel minder zeker en waarschijnlijk veel minder ernstig zijn dan vetdeskundigen overheidsinstanties en de media willen doen geloven
7257194 het artikeltje stelde dat de negatieve effecten van overgewicht ernstig overdreven worden door de mensen die goudgeld verdienen aan deze idee n feitelijk is nog erg weinig aangetoond maar alles is relatief als je erg veel overgewicht hebt moet je er natuurlijk wel wat aan doen aldus het artikel zo zie je maar dat wetenschap net als religie vroeger ernstig misbruikt kan worden we het gepeupel zitten nog steeds in hetzelfde schuitje kortom zorg dat je je lekker voelt in je lichaam en als dat niet zo is dan kun je meestal zelf wel aanvoelen waardoor het veroorzaakt wordt
7257195 het ventileren van de verleden teleurstellingen en het schelden op oude persoonlijke sporen kan ik echter moeilijk verenigen met de idee van groei en bewustzijnsverruiming
7257196 sommige termen in bovenstaande zouden als ironisch of zelfs cynisch ge nterpreteerd kunnen worden maar zijn zeker zo niet bedoeld
7257197 mijn eigen situatie om het een beetje concreet te houden zeg maar
7257198 nothing is so easy as to deceive oneself for what we wish
7257199 im so hungry my stomach is sticking to my backbone
7257200 het evolutionistische proces van een vuilverwerkingssysteem en zijn overeenkomst met de huidige structuren
7257201 meer dan dertig jaar experimenteren met betrekking tot de oorsprong van het leven op terreinen van chemie en moleculaire evolutie hebben tot een beter begrip geleid van de immensheid van het probleem van de oorsprong van het leven op aarde in plaats van dat het naar een oplossing geleid heeft bijna alle discussies over de voornaamste theorie n en experimenten op het terrein eindigen in een positie die schaakmat is of in een erkenning van de onwetendheid
7257202 nu op het moment dat we de twintigste eeuw achter ons laten hebben we nog steeds het grootste onopgeloste probleem dat we hadden toen we de twintigste eeuw ingingen hoe is het leven op aarde ontstaan
7257203 alles over de oorsprong van het leven op aarde is een mysterie en het lijkt wel hoe meer we weten des te acuter de puzzel wordt
7257204 het eenvoudigste soort cel een mechanisme heeft dat veel ingewikkelder is dan een
7257205 om de realiteit van het leven te begrijpen zoals zij door de microbiologie duidelijk is geworden moeten we ons een cel voorstellen die duizend miljoen maal vergroot is tot hij twintig kilometer in doorsnee is en op een gigantisch luchtschip lijkt dat groot genoeg is om een grote stad als londen of new york te bedekken we zien dan een voorwerp van onvergelijkbare complexiteit en toegepast ontwerp aan de oppervlakte van de cel zien we miljoenen openingen zoals poorten van een groot ruimteschip deze gaan open en dicht om een voortdurende stroom materialen in en uit laten gaan als we n van deze openingen binnengaan dan bevinden wij ons in een wereld van superieure technologie en ontzagwekkende complexiteit een complexiteit die voorbij onze creatieve mogelijkheden ligt een realiteit die de duidelijke tegenpool van het toeval is wat in elk opzicht alles wat met de intelligentie van de mens gemaakt is te boven gaat
7257206 tell susan what youre after and she delivers on time on point with no need for hand holding or nudging she is a personable probing interviewer a fluid writer and a versatile careful reporter a completely reliable pro

7257208 susan always hits her deadlines and needs little editing the rare times that i have asked susan to reword something she has proven very open to fitting her ideas to the needs of the publication and has made revisions swiftly her accuracy is impeccable other editors at the register who have worked with susan also find her an outstanding professional with a knack for writing in a smooth but unpretentious style her best work reads like an energetic chat with a smart friend
7257209 in the seven plus years i have worked with susan goulding she has consistently demonstrated what a wonderfully talented writer she is and has exhibited the utmost professionalism shes been an absolute pleasure to work with

7257214 good riddance you flake else i wouldnt be here today
7257215 zij gaat vanavond naar huis naar de mensen die om haar geven met een leuk verhaal en ik mag de woede van een man voelen die zijn grenzen zo ver heeft verlegd dat hij niet eens meer weet wat de betekenis van het woord redelijk is
7257216 80 uur werken plotseling naar het buitenland vertrekken zonder waarschuwing en dit alles niet betaald krijgen is niet gewoon lieverd in de psychologische wereld noemen wij dit misbruik
7257217 the democratic national committee is the ruling authority now but the tradition is that the presidential candidate will decide
7257218 they said ha ha ha because no presidential candidate is going to say were not seating new hampshire and were not seating iowa
7257219 how do you rate weve been in line for half an hour
7257220 were so and so on such and such and so and so on such and such
7257221 hey freddy didnt your parents ever tell you to stay away from there
7257222 yeah but its not my fault im taking his place he shouldnt have gotten into trouble
7257223 it would be really lazy of me not tot mow the lawn myself here
7257224 sjee hoe durft hij kijken naar een zwangere vrouw doe es normaal zeg zie je dan niet dat mijn decollet voor hele andere doeleinden geschikt is dan er naar te kijken met onkuise gedachten bah perverseling
7257225 ze heeft standpunten ingenomen die toch heel erg polariserend waren
7257226 medeverantwoordelijk is voor het klimaat waarin sommige islamieten zich zozeer van nederland vervreemd voelen dat zij zich niet langer gehouden voelen aan de nederlandse wet
7257227 als een bepaalde consensus tot stand is gekomen in nederland is het erg moeilijk om kritiek te leveren mensen zijn niet langer echt ge nteresseerd in filosofische discussies over de grondslagen en de dieper liggende kwesties die nu door de consensus beslecht zijn deze algehele overeenstemming moedigt de discussie ook niet aan
7257228 worden tegengestelde visies niet tegen elkaar uitgespeeld maar volgen ze elkaar op
7257229 we voeren het beleid geruisloos in omdat we bang zijn voor stennis
7257230 ik vind persoonlijk en dat is geen partijstandpunt dat je moet selecteren
7257231 talentvolle asielzoekers die bereid zijn de grondwet te erkennen en daarbij te leven geen gevaar maar een aanwinst zijn voor de samenleving verdienen de voorkeur boven de mensen die alles waar nederland voor staat afwijzen en een vijand worden van de staat
7257232 toepassing van de wet mag niet leiden tot uitholling van de open samenleving
7257233 nou bof jij even dat ik in je leven langskwam
7257234 als je met hem was getrouwd was je nu de vrouw van een pompbediende geweest in plaats van de vrouw van een directeur
7257235 schat als ik met hem getrouwd was geweest was h j de directeur geweest en j j de pompbediende
7257236 laten ze maar liever aan de buitenlanders komen dan aan mijn portemonnee
7257237 ook binnen de nak krijgen de grote schreeuwers gemakkelijk aanhang en proberen met populistische uitspraken sferen te bederven
7257238 ook in deze kerk geldt dat alles en iedereen die boven het maaiveld uitsteekt onthoofd wordt
7257239 gemeenten voortkwamen was het gewoonte dat de priesters met gevouwen handen onder het hoofd binnenkwamen
7257240 als een ert door dorst gedreem noar t koele woater smaacht
7257241 ze heeft standpunten ingenomen die toch heel erg polariserend waren
7257242 terwijl er binnen de kerk van de basis tot en met de leiding momenteel geknokt wordt om elke ziel
7257243 hirse ali s ook stamapostel i r fehr moeten luisteren vergeten indien niet dan dreigen wij met geweld
7257244 normaal komen alleen priesters of mannen in aanmerking voor mijn functie deze faculteit heeft zijn nek uitgestoken door mij als progressieve vrouw te benoemen als hoogleraar pastoraaltheologie met als zwaartepunt poimeniek ofwel de zielzorg dat is de enige leerstoel met deze opdracht in europa
7257245 dat klinkt misschien ouderwets maar ik wil juist proberen een heel moderne invulling te bedenken voor de pastorale werkers in het veld hoe kunnen deze mensen bijvoorbeeld in ziekenhuizen pati nten op een hedendaagse manier bijstaan vanuit een christelijke overtuiging
7257246 zo is de universiteit hier meer op management gericht de decaan heeft meer macht dat heeft iets effici nts maar het is ook jammer dat de inspraak minder groot is
7257247 in duitsland draait alles om de hoogleraar die rondom zijn eigen groepje de lijnen uitzet men staat weinig open voor contact met anderen hier heeft elke wetenschapper meer vrijheid en dat leidt dan ook tot meer samenwerking tussen verschillende disciplines
7257248 je wordt afgerekend op het aantal publicaties dat is goed om te laten zien wat er met de tijd is gebeurd maar ik vraag me af of er voldoende naar de kwaliteit gekeken wordt waarom staat een publicatie in een breed publieksblad ni t hoog aangeschreven
7257249 religiositeit is een gevoel dat komt vanuit jezelf in principe heeft iedereen dit gevoel het is het gevoel van verschuldigd zijn van iets onvoorwaardelijks dat gevoel is niet direct gekoppeld aan n religie afhankelijk van de cultuur waarin iemand opgroeit zal hij of zij daar invulling aan geven de religie uit zich in teksten rituelen en symbolen
7257250 er is niet n geloof dat het exclusieve recht op de ware religiositeit heeft ook streef ik niet naar n soort middengeloof dat voor iedereen geldig is elke cultuur zal zijn religie op eigen wijze invullen maar vanuit die eigen visie kun je wel met elkaar in dialoog gaan dat sluit fundamentalisme uit religiositeit kan niet samengaan met fundamentalisme niet in het christelijke geloof en ook niet in de islam je moet respect hebben voor de ander vanuit de eigen standpunten al mag je best aangeven waar voor jou de grens overschreden wordt
7257251 een ander bijstaan in geestelijke nood dat is een van de taken van de pastorale zorg en anders dan een psychiater of psycholoog zal zo iemand dat doen vanuit een christelijke traditie ik ben op zoek naar een modern concept voor de zielzorg een concept dat past bij deze tijd daarom mag zon pastoraal medewerker geen missionaris zijn hij werkt vanuit een godsbeeld dat veelomvattend is de psychiatrisch therapeutische kant de sociaal politieke kant en de spirituele kant het gaat erom dat zo iemand multireligieus opereert m t respect voor het geloof van de ander is hij op zoek naar sporen gods deze sporen vertegenwoordigen religieuze waarden als gij zult niet doden of er is meer dan het materi le geluk je gaat daarbij uit van de culturele context van de ander en van daaruit biedt de pastoraal medewerker de sleutel van het christendom aan om de god in zichzelf te vinden die kan dus van een andere religie zijn maar kan bijvoorbeeld niet fundamentalistisch zijn in zon geval trekt de zielzorger wel een grens
7257252 wij zijn ons ervan bewust dat de katholieke kerk ook niet brandschoon is niet alles is goed elke religie heeft zijn tradities en je moet die bekijken vanuit de geschiedenis je zult deze niet goedkeuren en vanuit een hedendaags perspectief de traditie bekritiseren
7257253 zoals we de discussie aangaan met mensen van andere geloven zo kun je ook binnen de eigen kerk discussi ren het tweede vaticaanse concilie uit midden jaren zestig red zegt dat je als gelovige het goede uit het verleden moet behouden maar wel voortdurend met de tijd mee moet gaan je moet vernieuwen hoe kunnen wij de tekenen des tijds vertalen in een moderne kerk
7257254 het gaat om de kritische solidariteit en de hoop dat de kerk de poorten opent voor de moderne samenleving
7257255 en dan krijg je tegenwind hoe krachtiger die wind hoe harder je moet fietsen
7257256 als dat betekent dat we niet meer openstaan voor de moderne tijd is dat slecht mensen lopen dan weg en wij willen geen mini kerk we moeten het geloof aantrekkelijk maken door de tekenen des tijds te verstaan
7257257 als we niet openstaan voor de moderne tijd dan zal de kerk nog meer leeglopen laat de christenen kijken naar de praktijk van christus van nazareth hij stond in zijn tijd open voor de mens en liet de mensen in hun waarde zonder zijn geloof geweld aan te doen
7257258 een van de redenen om naar nederland te komen was het liberale beleid waarom dit land bekend staat
7257259 en hoewel nederland nog altijd liberaler is dan duitsland vallen sommige discussies tegen
7257260 zoals het migratiebeleid en de manier waarop over normen en waarden gesproken wordt
7257261 en de sociale bezuinigingen ongelooflijk wat men hier op de ziektekosten wil korten wij dachten dat het systeem hier goed georganiseerd was maar dat valt in de praktijk tegen
7257262 bewust zijn van saamhorigheid en de bereidheid de consequenties daarvan te dragen
7257263 je bent niet alleen dom je bent er nog eigenwijs bij ook
7257264 toen de dag van pinksteren aanbrak waren zij allen op n plaats bijeen plotseling kwam er uit de hemel een geraas alsof er een hevige wind opstak en het vulde heel het huis waar zij waren er verschenen hun vurige tongen die zich verspreidden en zich op ieder van hen neerzetten zij raakten allen vol van heilige geest en begonnen te spreken in vreemde talen zoals de geest hun ingaf
7257265 toen dat geluid opkwam liep de menigte te hoop en raakte in verwarring omdat iedereen hen in zijn eigen taal hoorde spreken
7257266 wee u schriftgeleerden en farizee n gij huichelaars want gij reinigt de buitenzijde van de beker en van de schotel maar van binnen zijn zij vol roof en onmatigheid zo ook gij van buiten schijnt gij de mensen wel rechtvaardig doch van binnen zijt gij vol huichelarij en wetsverachting
7257267 maar bij de profeten van jeruzalem heb ik gezien wat afschuwelijk is echtbreken en met leugen omgaan zij sterken de handen der boosdoeners dat niet n zich van zijn boosheid bekeert zij zijn mij altezamen als sodom geworden zijn inwoners als gomorra
7257268 zij zeggen voortdurend tot wie mij verachten de here heeft gesproken gij zult vrede hebben en tot ieder die wandelt in verstoktheid van hart zeggen zij geen kwaad zal u overkomen
7257269 want van de profeten van jeruzalem is de heiligschennis uitgegaan over het gehele land
7257270 zo zegt de here der heerscharen hoort niet naar de woorden der profeten die u profeteren zij maken dat gij u aan een ijdele waan overgeeft zij spreken het gezicht van hun eigen hart niet uit des heren mond
7257271 ik heb die profeten niet gezonden toch hebben zij gelopen ik heb tot hen niet gesproken toch hebben zij geprofeteerd maar als zij in mijn raad hadden gestaan dan zouden zij mijn volk mijn woorden hebben doen horen dan zouden zij hen hebben doen terugkeren van hun boze weg en van de boosheid hunner handelingen
7257272 de profeet die een droom heeft vertelle een droom en die mijn woord heeft spreke mijn woord naar waarheid wat heeft het stro met het koren gemeen luidt het woord des heren is niet mijn woord zo als een vuur luidt het woord des heren of als een hamer die een steenrots vermorzelt
7257273 tot de wet en tot de getuigenis voor wie niet spreekt naar dit woord is er geen dageraad
7257274 wee u schriftgeleerden en farizee n gij huichelaars want gij reinigt de buitenzijde van de beker en van de schotel maar van binnen zijn zij vol roof en onmatigheid zo ook gij van buiten schijnt gij de mensen wel rechtvaardig doch van binnen zijt gij vol huichelarij en wetsverachting
7257275 maar bij de profeten van jeruzalem heb ik gezien wat afschuwelijk is echtbreken en met leugen omgaan zij sterken de handen der boosdoeners dat niet n zich van zijn boosheid bekeert zij zijn mij altezamen als sodom geworden zijn inwoners als gomorra
7257276 zij zeggen voortdurend tot wie mij verachten de here heeft gesproken gij zult vrede hebben en tot ieder die wandelt in verstoktheid van hart zeggen zij geen kwaad zal u overkomen

7257280 de profeet die een droom heeft vertelle een droom en die mijn woord heeft spreke mijn woord naar waarheid wat heeft het stro met het koren gemeen luidt het woord des heren is niet mijn woord zo als een vuur luidt het woord des heren of als een hamer die een steenrots vermorzelt

7257289 tot de wet en tot de getuigenis voor wie niet spreekt naar dit woord is er geen dageraad
7257290 kies de katholiek die ons land op de minst christelijke manier heeft gediend
7257291 de geroyeerde jezu et ex priester en dichter huub oosterhuis heeft nog nooit iets fatsoenlijks geschreven toch geniet hij al sinds de jaren zestig een onverwoestbare reputatie bij progressieve kerkgangers die jezus naar hun eigen beeld hebben herschapen als een vrij nederland abonnee met een voorkeur voor max havelaar koffie linnen schoudertasjes en een onverzorgde tuin
7257292 zijn politiek correcte versjes hebben in menige kerk de voorkeur gekregen boven het tijdloze repertoire van de psalmdichters dat oosterhuis in de jaren zeventig sympathiseerde met de cpn en het oostblok socialisme is hem reeds lang vergeven
7257293 kies de apostolische die ons land op de minst christelijke manier heeft gediend
7257294 de geroyeerde apostel ex corantijn lid en knecht gods gerrit sepers nog nooit iets fatsoenlijks geschreven of gepreekt toch geniet hij al sinds de jaren 80 een onverwoestbare reputatie bij progressieve ex leden die jezus naar hun eigen beeld hebben herschapen als een apostolische kritiek abonnee met een voorkeur voor laphroaig linnen schoudertasjes en een luxe villa in wildervanck of amersfoort
7257295 zijn politiek correcte praatjes hebben bij menige ex apostool de voorkeur gekregen boven het tijdloze repertoire van de woorden van god dat sepers in de jaren 80 sympathiseerde met de friedrich bisschof en het oostblok socialisme is hem reeds lang vergeven
7257296 kies de apostolische die ons land op de minst christelijke manier heeft gediend
7257297 de geroyeerde apostel ex corantijn lid en knecht gods gerrit sepers nog nooit iets fatsoenlijks geschreven of gepreekt toch geniet hij al sinds de jaren 80 een onverwoestbare reputatie bij progressieve ex leden die jezus naar hun eigen beeld hebben herschapen als een apostolische kritiek abonnee met een voorkeur voor laphroaig linnen schoudertasjes en een luxe villa in wildervanck of amersfoort

7257299 wir sollen nicht weichen f r schweine wie jack und bauke
7257300 hoe wijzer wij worden des te minder goed kunnen anderen zich bij ons aanpassen hoe meer wij leren des te meer moeten we erop rekenen dat we in eenzaamheid moeten leven
7257301 en toch koos ik na een jaar of 6 weer voor een actievere rol binnen de nak en voor meer overgave aan mijn persoonlijke geloof gestoeld op de nak doctrine
7257302 vergeef het hun vader want ze weten niet wat ze doen
7257303 een nieuw apostolische kerk in district groningen heeft de broeder en zusters opgeroepen om deze film niet te bekijken
7257304 ik zeg niks omdat sepers in zulke situaties ook niets zegt
7257305 met stijgende verbazing heb ik het stukje gelezen en ik begrijp dat je de namen van je vrienden die nog in de kerk zijn niet kunt noemen daar ze anders in de problemen zouden kunnen komen ik vraag mij nu toch ernstig af wat is dit voor een kerk
7257306 jullie kunnen nog niet alles verdragen maar als de tijd rijp is zal ik jullie alles openbaren
7257307 vechten betekent immers precies het tegenovergestelde van liefde ik begrijp deze woorden dan ook niet goed van de stamapostel
7257308 beter een geduldig mens dan een vechtjas beter zelfbeheersing dan een stad veroveren
7257309 10 ten slotte zoek uw kracht in de heer in de kracht van zijn macht 11 trek de wapenrusting van god aan om stand te kunnen houden tegen de listen van de duivel 12 onze strijd is niet gericht tegen mensen maar tegen hemelse vorsten de heersers en de machthebbers van de duisternis tegen de kwade geesten in de hemelsferen 13 neem daarom de wapens van god op om weerstand te kunnen bieden op de dag van het kwaad om goed voorbereid stand te kunnen houden 14 houd stand met de waarheid als gordel om uw heupen de gerechtigheid als harnas om uw borst 15 de inzet voor het evangelie van de vrede als sandalen aan uw voeten 16 en draag bovenal het geloof als schild waarmee u alle brandende pijlen van hem die het kwaad zelf is kunt doven 17 draag als helm de verlossing en als zwaard de geest dat wil zeggen gods woorden
7257310 de touwtjes worden flink aan getrokken bijna op een zakelijke manier die bij een multinational niet zou misstaan
7257311 liefde is het nige wapen dat een vijand in een vriend kan veranderen
7257312 zwak worden als je in de evangelisatie niet kan overtuigen
7257313 how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news who proclaims peace who brings glad tidings of good things who proclaims salvation who says to zion your god reigns
7257314 het zijn vooral de voormalige anti dapers die promotie hebben gemaakt r brink en f schouwenaar vreemd hoor die goddelijke aanwijzingen
7257315 is geloven in de 21e eeuw makkelijker of moeilijker dan voorheen
7257316 maar men heeft dan tenminste geleerd op school hoe je op een normale en een verantwoordelijke manier te filosoferen en te discussi ren dat mis ik nu erg vooral op deze nak getinte sites
7257317 de kerk loopt 10 jaar achter op de maatschappij ja uiteraard tjerk een grote club vereniging past zich altijd aan het tempo van de zwaksteschakel aan
7257318 dag tjerk zet aub nog eens zon zielig verhaal op deze site met een link naar een mp3 van jou zodat wij kunnen beluisteren hoe zelfgenoegzaam jij wel niet bent
7257319 12 behoed je naam hij blijft langer bij je dan duizenden grote schatten van goud 13 een goed leven heeft een eindig aantal dagen maar een goede naam blijft tot in eeuwigheid
7257320 leven door de geest 13 broeders en zusters u bent geroepen om vrij te zijn misbruik die vrijheid niet om uw eigen verlangens te bevredigen maar dien elkaar in liefde 14 want de hele wet is vervuld in n uitspraak heb uw naaste lief als uzelf 15 maar wanneer u elkaar aanvliegt pas dan maar op dat u niet door elkaar wordt verslonden 19 het is bekend wat onze eigen wil allemaal teweegbrengt ontucht zedeloosheid en losbandigheid 20 afgoderij en toverij vijandschap tweespalt jaloezie en woede gekonkel geruzie en rivaliteit 21 afgunst bras en slemppartijen en nog meer van dat soort dingen ik herhaal de waarschuwing die ik u al eerder gaf wie zich aan deze dingen overgeven zullen geen deel hebben aan het koninkrijk van god
7257321 8 de wind waait waarheen hij wil je hoort zijn geluid maar je weet niet waar hij vandaan komt en waar hij heen gaat
7257322 wir aber sind nicht von denen die zur ckweichen und verdammt werden sondern von denen die glauben und die seele erretten
7257323 wij echter behoren niet tot degenen die terugdeinzen en ten onder gaan maar tot hen die door hun geloof behouden blijven
7257324 es ist besser ungerechtigkeiten zu ertragen als die einheit zu gef hrden
7257325 wir aber sind nicht von denen die zur ckweichen und verdammt werden sondern von denen die glauben und die seele erretten
7257326 wij echter behoren niet tot degenen die terugdeinzen en ten onder gaan maar tot hen die door hun geloof behouden blijven
7257327 es ist besser ungerechtigkeiten zu ertragen als die einheit zu gef hrden
7257328 es ist besser ungerechtigkeiten zu ertragen als die einheit zu gef hrden
7257329 de weg naar het beloofde land is de weg van het recht doen
7257330 wir haben geh rt sie waren einm tig beieinander sie waren eine einheit und jetzt wollen wir ehrlich die fragen stellen wie ist es in deiner familie mit der einheit in der gemeinde im mterkreis vielleicht im chor oder orchester sollte da die einheit nicht vorhanden sein dann wollen wir alles daran setzten damit es ab heute m glich ist ein apostel sagte mal lasst uns herzlich beieinander sein und es ist besser die ungerechtigkeit zu ertragen als die einheit zu gef hrden und in einer solchen einheit kann auch heute noch ein pfingstwunder geschehen
7257331 ich ermahne euch aber liebe br der im namen unseres hern jesus christus dass ihr alle mit einer stimme redet und lasst keine spaltung unter euch sein sondern haltet einander fest in einem sinn und in einer meinung
7257332 ein sinn oder ein gesinnung das muss die gesinnung jesu christi sein
7257333 die liebe zu den menschen das aufschauen zu gott seinem vater das sendungsbewusstsein des gottessohnes
7257334 theologische fragen die in der heiligen schrift nicht eindeutig beantwortet werden
7257335 zeitfragen also die bertragung christlicher grundlagen auf die heutige zeit
7257336 die f hrung durch den heiligen geist im apostelamt und letztlich die entscheidung durch den stammapostel
7257337 da spielen ja auch unterschiedliche gesellschaftliche verh ltnisse un den verschiedenen teilen der welt eine rolle
7257338 gewiss muss man die regionalen verh ltnisse ber cksichtigen und ist daher gezwungen die eine oder andere offizielle aussage anzupassen an die dortigen gegebenheiten aber die grundlinie muss immer stimmen da muss immer eine meinung bestehen
7257339 auf den pers nlichen geschmack oder die pers nliche sehensweise ankommen vielmehr auf die lenkung durch den heiligen geist im apostelamt
7257340 zu der die menschen gar keinen inneren zugang mehr finden w rden
7257341 die geschwister einzuengen oder anders ausgedr ckt den schmalen weg noch schmaler zu machen
7257342 wir wollen uns nicht zu sehr aufteilen lassen in progressive und konservative bezirksapostel oder bezirksapostelhelfer sondern daf r sorgen dass die einheit in diesem kreis auch von au en erkannt wird
7257343 dass wir dar ber wachen was wir wie und wem sagen
7257344 schokkende artikelen over apostel de bruijn en zijn vazallen klene clan en de distriktvoorganger van assen
7257345 u wilt geen kritiek op uw kerkje u wilt u kop in het zand u bent ziende blind
7257346 morgen kom ik met bewijzen tegen de clan die onze kerk bestuurt u zult versteld staan
7257347 precies om 10 00 zal uw broeder bauke op zijn site zeer pijnlijke informatie presenteren waarna het gehoon zeker zal stillen
7257348 en toch zult u morgen achterover slaan en spijt hebben van uw argwaan dan is het te laat
7257349 precies om 10 00 zal uw broeder bauke op zijn site zeer pijnlijke informatie presenteren waarna het gehoon zeker zal stillen
7257350 ik heb nu wel medelijden met diegenen die zoals geadviseerd een ochtendje vrij hebben genomen
7257351 gaat u ook zo in discussie met uw voorganger uw vrouw of uw man
7257352 vanavond wordt de surfer uitgebreid en zal eea geplaatst worden
7257353 men hield met geweld de blinden gesloten en wilde het zonlicht op deze wijze beletten te schijnen
7257354 geplaatst door roel 16 juni 2006 om 11 23 is er nou al nieuws dat pieter van hes zich hiervoor leent
7257355 even los van het feit dat de prediking is doorspekt van oorlogstaal zie ik geen enkele theologische verdieping
7257356 lieve god bedankt dat u me uit de grootste zorg hebt gehaald afgelopen week ontving ik een envelop met 100 euro erin dit is in ieder geval genoeg om even te overleven maar helaas niet zo lang
7257357 es ist besser ungerechtigkeiten zu ertragen als die einheit zu gef hrden
7257358 das thema ist kein dogma mehr jeder kann sich sein eigenes urteil dar ber bilden
7257359 stammapostel johann gottfried bischoff k ndigte 1951 an dass jesus noch zu seinen lebzeiten wiederkommen w rde 1960 starb bischoff
7257360 dass sich die vorhersage von stammapostel bischoff nicht erf llt hat bleibt f r mich eine ungekl rte frage
7257361 ber die wahren zusammenh nge m chte ich kein abschlie endes urteil f llen vielleicht hat stammapostel bischoff etwas falsch gedeutet oder es wurden bedingungen genannt die wir nicht kennen
7257362 bischoff hat doch seine botschaft nicht nur einmal gemacht er hat sie in predigten st ndig wiederholt
7257363 das thema ist kein dogma mehr jeder kann sich sein eigenes urteil dar ber bilden
7257364 ze weten het zo goed het lijkt wel of ze bij o l h aan tafel hebben gezeten
7257365 hoe wijzer wij worden des te minder goed kunnen anderen zich bij ons aanpassen hoe meer wij leren des te meer moeten we erop rekenen dat we in eenzaamheid moeten leven
7257366 voor het begrijpen van de waarheid is een hoger orgaan vereist dan voor het verdedigen van een dwaling
7257367 ik ben juist een groot voorstaander van de scheiding van mensenwerk en geloofszaken
7257368 zondags zitten ze voorin de kerk maar maandag zijn het beesten
7257369 dan heeft dus en de voorganger en de districtsvoorganger zich vergist
7257370 wat zijn we blij en dankbaar dat we nog in het godshuis kunnen en mogen zijn we bidden voor kinderlijk geloven en een gehoorzaam hart
7257371 je mag niet in de bron spugen waar je vroeger uit gedronken hebt
7257372 een filosoof denkt na over de zin van het leven nou ik weet niet wat de zin van het leven is maar het lijkt me niet de bedoeling dat je daar de hele tijd over na moet gaan zitten nadenken
7257373 als je over gods woord zou moeten discussi ren dan zou dat inderdaad op zon manier moeten
7257374 o dicht bij jezus of een lievelingslied van sepers en pos mijn jezus is mijn beste vriend
7257375 totem godsdienst naar een poly the stische en ook vrouwelijke godsdienst naar een uiteindelijke mono the stische godsdienst mannelijke
7257376 ja god maar door marijke kom ik niet meer in de kerk en heb ik afstand van u genomen
7257377 werelds terrein en als je daar was als jezus kwam dan was het niet best
7257378 de kerk is alleen een transformatorhuisje dat de krachtstroom van de man die daar in palestina in het zand schreef eerlijk verdeelt maar wat hebben ze ervan gemaakt
7257379 je weet het h ik ben getrouwd met mijn lieftallige echtgenote n et met de kerk
7257380 er kan bijvoorbeeld een handtekeningenactie worden opgezet ter ondersteuning van de open brief die sepers naar het bestuur van de nak heeft gestuurd
7257381 jezus was in zijn tijd ook nogal recalcitrant en had afwijkende meningen tov van de joodse traditie waarin hij opgevoed was
7257382 val dan niet weer in die zelfde fout maar doe hier onderzoek naar
7257383 je hebt het erg vaak over ambtsbroeders ipv dienaren ik herken er niks in ook van vroeger niet
7257384 vroegere pijnlijke ervaringen kan het dan niet zo zijn dat je manier van aankijken tegen dienaren daardoor sterk wordt gekleurd
7257385 dat was ook al zou misschien die vraag bij jezelf niet zijn opgekomen dat je wist dat wanneer je ooit zelf iets te vragen zou hebben dat de lieve god daar dan door zijn knecht k de tijd voor zou nemen
7257386 als ik zalig wil worden dien ik dan nieuw apostolisch te worden
7257387 als er enig heil zou zijn dan zou ik liever ten eeuwigen dage verdoemd worden dan een heil deelachtig worden waarvan ook maar n schepsel hoe gering ook zou zijn uitgesloten
7257388 luister in ieder geval ook naar de andere partij voordat je oordeelt
7257389 iets is weg als wij zeker weten dat het er niet meer is maar weten wij zeker dat iets dat weg is nog ergens moet zijn dan spreken wij van kwijt
7257390 ik probeer het in het juiste licht te zien maar niet om het geloof ambten fout te willen zien het is dan dat god spreekt door de dienaren de heilige geest werkt dan toch
7257391 ik probeer een goed antwoord te krijgen zoniet dan zocht ik het hogerop
7257392 maar laten we eerlijk wezen je kunt niet op alles een antwoord wat voor jou zo intens is krijgen
7257393 mijn vraag is als de lieve god je een ambt geeft afgebeden doe je wat god van je verwacht en vraagt als je dan toch een andere weg in slaat die haaks staat op wat voor ons en mij zo belangrijk is dan ben je menselijk en niet goddelijk bezig
7257394 wie in de liefde blijft blijft in god en god blijft in hem
7257395 10 en de een diene den ander elk met de gave welke hij ontvangen heeft als goede huishouders der menigerlei genade gods 11 spreekt iemand dat hij het spreke als gods woorden heeft iemand een ambt dat hij het waarneme door de kracht die god geeft opdat god in alle dingen verheerlijkt worde door jezus christus wien zij eer en kracht van eeuwigheid tot eeuwigheid amen
7257396 1 is er nu enige vermaning in christus is er enige troost der liefde is er enige gemeenschap des geestes is er enige hartelijke liefde en ontferming bij u 2 zo vervult mijne vreugd dat gij eensgezind zijt gelijke liefde hebt van n gemoed en n gevoelen zijt
7257397 die bijbelteksten zelf dingen bedenken ken toch ook want voor 80 is de bijbel niet echt waar wat er staat
7257398 geef eens een goed voorbeeld waarin vrouwen belangrijk zijn in de gemeente dan bedoel ik niet kinderen opvoeden zondagsschooljuf zijn oppasmoeder schoonmaken bloemetjes schikken muziek maken etc
7257399 ik schreef dat ik zeer een vrouwelijke zielzorger mis ik kan kiezen voor een vrouwelijke arts maar niet voor een vrouwelijke ziele arts
7257400 ik zou eerst maar eens gaan lezen wat eq precies is aan je reactie te merken weet je het niet
7257401 er is inmiddels een vrouwelijke jeugdleider een begin voor de meiden
7257402 een vraag is als de districkt apostel in een speciale dienst verteld heb ik gelezen dat je jezelf dan in de duisternis plaatst als je hierdoor de dienst verlaat dat snap ik niet dat mag je toch niet vanaf het altaar zeggen de lieve god is toch alleen maar genade en liefde en kan je dan ook niet in de duisternis plaasten alleen maar in het licht
7257403 een weinig opzij te gaan om hemzelf niet het zonlicht te benemen
7257404 opdat gij mij niet ontneemt wat gij mij n et kunt geven
7257405 heden zo gij hoort zijn vaderstemme zo verhardt dan uwe harten niet
7257406 inderdaad heb ik vandaag gesproken over bijbelteksten mijn opvatting over bijbel is uitgebreid de bijbel is duizenden jaren oud de bijbel is geschreven door vele mensen nu is mijn vraag denk jij dat al die mensen de waarheid spraken mensen hadden andere opvatting van geloof we leven nu in 2005 een mens heeft in bepaalde opvatting meer kennis gekregen hier kun je nog lang over discusieren maar lijkt me niet nodig
7257407 uw overtuiging is een aangelegenheid tussen u en god gelukkig is wie zich niet schuldig voelt over zijn overtuiging
7257408 laat de dwazen op hun wijze door het dal der tranen gaan
7257409 het weg jagen en de laan uit sturen van sepers
7257410 let maar eens op het zijn degenen die het meest belerend dienen die vallen over hun hoogmoed
7257411 zij die weten spreken niet en zij die spreken weten niet
7257412 u beminnen dat is leven en ach zo kan ik nog wel uren doorgaan
7257413 er is geen geld meer voor een apostel op de centrale administratie
7257414 was ze het er ook echt inhoudelijk 100 mee eens
7257415 ik maak mij bezorgd over meelezer hij poneerde een stelling en niemand reageerde pas op allemaal want anders wil hij niet meer meedoen
7257416 heb ik elke dag gebeden en pake grootvader respecteerde dat
7257417 dit is de bank van boer x jullie mogen hier niet zitten
7257418 maar apostel henwood was in werkelijkheid bepakt en bezakt hij bracht vele geloofsschatten mee en doordat hij die met ons heeft gedeeld ben ik nu hier in uw midden what a joy
7257419 die brede maatschappelijke discussie daar zie ik helemaal niets in
7257420 er is in zijn werk geen behoefte aan adviseurs maar wel aan redders die zonder geduwd te worden het water inspringen
7257421 is het niet zo om iemand te kunnen redden dat er zelf gezwommen moet kunnen worden
7257422 ik dacht dat de leer zelf van jezus de redder is het schip en dat mensen proberen om het schip drijvende te houden
7257423 ik denk dat de geloofsleer in ieder geval gaandeweg aangepast wordt alleen niet met grote stappen zodat het haast onmerkbaar is
7257424 ik denk echt dat het geen kwaad kan en ook noodzakelijk is om de geloofsleer aan de eigen tijd aan te passen
7257425 probeer eens te denken aan het belang van het geheel dat wat verantwoordelijkheid is van de eerste officier of van ons allemaal
7257426 of zijn er toch nog dienaren die hun alter ego poetsen en het een erebaantje vinden om dienaar te zijn in het huis des heren
7257427 mijn broeders en mijn zusters zijn net zo goed soms zelfs nog beter als ikzelf het loon zal voor ons allemaal hetzelfde zijn
7257428 alles wat gij aan n mijner minste hebt gedaan geldt voor ons allemaal weest elkanders helper
7257429 hoe zie jij ambtsgave die in je vloeit na de inzetting in een ambt is hier al iets over gemeld
7257430 dat is mevrouw n n zij komt wel eens bij ons in de winkel je ziet het niet maar zij is al in de 80 altijd is zij onderweg en bezoekt ouderen en zieken in onze winkel koopt ze dan iets lekkers om hen daarmee te verrassen
7257431 zij treden door t leven zijn vol blijde moed banaadren de mensen helpend en goed
7257432 roep eens goed om hulp anders blijf je dobberen geen kapitein voorganger die doorvaart
7257433 nooit zelden kreeg je antwoord ook niet wanneer je een vuurpijl afschoot
7257434 vage gast misschien kun jij de stem uit het noorden helpen omdat in jouw situatie nu het een en ander verbeterd is misschien kan je de stem uit het noorden de goeie richting opduwen richting kust
7257435 echter op dit moment heb ik oppervlakkig contact met de onderofficier
7257436 het gebrek van mensen is dat ze zo weinig willen leren van andermans fouten
7257437 om evenbij het bootje te blijven maar dan gaan we toch niet van de boot springen he
7257438 ik geniet van de geestelijke muziek maar kan het niet meer opbrengen om naar de nak te gaan daar wordt teveel los gemaakt wat niet had mogen gebeuren
7257439 ik denk dat vele mensen willen geloven en niets met allerlei gehannes te maken willen hebben als ik zo vrij mag zijn voor anderen te spreken
7257440 god door wie u geroepen bent om n te zijn met zijn zoon jezus christus onze heer is trouw
7257441 mag die weg soms moeilijk gaan op het einddoel komt het aan
7257442 m b t de brief van de bruijn kan het zijn dat hij steun zoekt bij leber vanwege de zorgwekkende positie van nak nederland
7257443 ik probeer een goed antwoord te krijgen zoniet dan zocht ik het hogerop
7257444 maar laten we eerlijk wezen je kunt niet op alles een antwoord wat voor jou zo intens is krijgen
7257445 mijn vraag is als de lieve god je een ambt geeft afgebeden doe je wat god van je verwacht en vraagt als je dan toch een andere weg in slaat die haaks staat op wat voor ons en mij zo belangrijk is dan ben je menselijk en niet goddelijk bezig
7257446 wie in de liefde blijft blijft in god en god blijft in hem
7257447 wij zijn op de weg ten leven die een school der vorming is
7257448 dan had je om beter gehoor te krijgen ook maar wat meer to the point moeten zijn
7257449 in memoriam j b cardale te hebben niet verscheuren maar samenbrengen en versterken wat zwak is geworden is de kern de apostolische christelijke grondwet een simpele tekst met inhoud
7257450 na alles wat ik zoal hier van je gelezen hebt doet het me veel plezier dat je dit ook op een fijne wijze op deze site hebt geplaatst
7257451 derhalve liever niet wachten op inclusiviteit kent dap de bruijn dit begrip niet of zegt het u niets
7257452 gerrit sepers is normaal bereid bij eventuele fouten te bekennen
7257453 ten aanzien van gj s wat heeft deze man niet allemaal betekend voor de nak wat voor een groots arbeid heeft deze man in het verleden allemaal verricht
7257454 wat zou het werk gods er mooier uit gaan zien als de dienaren in deze tijd zich zouden verootmoedigen
7257455 ik heb god lief en je broeder of zuster niet kan zien of luchten
7257456 als je vindt dat je broer wel veel verstand van autos heeft en de andere broer heel veel van medicijnen dan ben je pas een ware broeder als je met jouw specifieke kennis hun dit karwei uit handen had genomen en daar ter plekke raad ondersteuning en bijstand had gegeven
7257457 om een beleid te voeren heb je toch armslag en een zekere macht nodig
7257458 zaak is natuurlijk wel of je dan iets kan doen om de schade te beperken kun je iets doen als je het van tevoren al niet kon
7257459 dat is toch eenvoudig dan moet men afstand doen van zijn verlangen
7257460 je loopt nog wel eens tegen een muur van weerstand
7257461 er is veel fout gegaan in leeuwarden en alleen de bruijn is verantwoordelijk
7257462 was jij trouwens op de crematie van o heeres het was ook jouw collega
7257463 jij schrijft over de sfeer op de ca die was ook vaak om te snijden
7257464 ik vindt het jammer om g j s onderuit te schoffelen want wat kan hij er aan doen als hij ook tegen een muur is aangelopen inzake leeuwarden
7257465 het is dom dat de aangeboden hulp van sepers in de wind is geslagen het is niet slim om geen gebruik te maken van de kennis van iemand die er meer van af weet dan jij
7257466 g j sepers 23 augustus 2005 20 05 e mail
7257467 b ik heb alleen in 1e instantie vragen gesteld en de hoop uitgesproken dat zij zich hebben laten adviseren door deskundigen
7257468 en ik ben van mening dat je als je kritiek hebt dit maar rechtstreeks met diegene moet bespreken
7257469 wie heeft de vergeving ontvangen na de gemaakte fouten ik weet het niet
7257470 schep o god een zuiver hart in mij vernieuw mijn geest maak mij standvastig
7257471 onze strijd is niet gericht tegen mensen maar tegen hemelse vorsten de heersers en de machthebbers van de duisternis tegen de kwade geesten in de hemelsferen
7257472 vader vergeef hun want ze weten niet wat ze doen
7257473 jezus denk aan mij wanneer u in uw koninkrijk komt
7257474 ik meen dan ook dat het verstandig is om voor dit soort gevallen een ter zake kundige
7257475 ja dit geld ook voor mannelijke slachtoffers dit zullen er echter veel minder zijn ik vind het flauw dat je dat aanhaald
7257476 is het niet verstandig om ons in dit forum bezig te houden met nog andere belangrijke zaken bijvoorbeeld stille armoede onder de brs en zrs ook in ons landje zijn ze er of is dit onderwerp niet zo belangrijk en houden wij ons alleen maar bezig met de misstanden van heeft sexualiteit meer publiciteit dan het wel en wee van diegene die op een andere wijze het moeilijk hebben
7257477 je gebruikt dit forum om je eigen gedachten te ordenen en je ongenoegen te ventileren
7257478 maar de laatste tijd is de enige die hier nog wat schrijft vage gast
7257479 met adequaat bijstaan na doorverwijzing doelt u op een continue terugkoppeling van deskundigen naar dienaren
7257480 ik kan mijn herinneren dat onze toemalig apostel sepers dit een keer verzorgde tijdens een jeugddienst omdat distr apostel ir pos accuut was opgenomen in een ziekenhuis
7257481 ik denk dat de stamapostel bij een leemte in principe voorziet in de sacramentenbediening voor de ontslapenen
7257482 ik wilde het toespitsen op bijv slachtoffer en daderproblematiek een intensieve training van dienaren gegeven door professionals in de omgang met dader en slachtoffer kan ook een toevoeging zijn
7257483 ik roep u allen op om leeuwarden te laten rusten
7257484 ik heb op dit moment mijn eigen strijd om trouw te blijven en ik denk dat zo een ieder zijn eigen strijd moet leveren het gaat er uiteindelijk om of ik de goede strijd heb gestreden om het einddoel te bereiken en ik vraag mij af of je dit doel niet kan bereiken zonder het bezoeken van de diensten je moet het eindelijk zelf doen en er is geen dienaar die dit voor je regeld
7257485 ik ben de ware wijnstok en mijn vader is de wijngaardenier
7257486 ik ben de wijnstok gij zijt de ranken wie in mij blijft en ik in hem die draagt veel vrucht want zonder mij kunt gij niets doen
7257487 niet dat wij heersers zijn over uw geloof maar wij zijn medehelpers uwer vreugde want gij staat in het geloof
7257488 maar de vaste grond gods staat vast en heeft dit zegel de heer kent de zijnen
7257489 nu echter be indig ik mijn deelname aan het forumberaad definitief het gaat niet om mij en het ging ook niet om mij het gaat erom dat er ware gemeenschapszin kan zijn in het werk des heren
7257490 het begrip geloof wordt vertaald als denken hopen en voelen de volgende stap is dan dat geloof tot ervaringen leidt en dit leidt vervolgens tot een weten geloof is dan een weten geworden begrippen die menigeen op deze manier toegepast kent
7257491 wat ik niet begrijp leg ik in geloof naast me neer
7257492 ik ben geboren om te moeten vechten en strijden tegen machten en duivelen daarom zijn mijn boeken vaak heftig en fel ik moet bonken en stenen uitroeien doornen en hagen afhakken kuilen opvullen vrije baan maken en de grond toebereiden maar filippus melanchton een vriend van luhter deze aanvulling is van bauke gaat keurig en stil zijn gang bouwt en plant zaait en begiet met lust al naar mate god hem rijkelijk zijn gaven heeft gegeven zo ik ergens tekort schiet heb ik liever dat ik te hard spreek maar mij houd aan de goddelijke waarheid
7257493 dat soort incidenten gebeurt redelijk vaak in burundi omdat de bevolking illegaal wapens in bezit heeft die tijdens de burgeroorlog verworven werden
7257494 waar de tabakslobby bij andere disputen over de gevaren van het roken twijfel probeerde te zaaien werd het bestaan van polonium 210 en de risicos daarvan gewoonweg verzwegen
7257495 het vlaams parlement moet zijn verantwoordelijkheid nemen en eenzijdige stappen zetten naar onze onafhankelijkheid we roepen de vlaamse politici dan ook op om niet langer tijd te verliezen in een zoektocht naar het onvindbare compromis met de franstaligen
7257496 als brussel en walloni met elkaar verbonden zijn kunnen ze bij de ontbinding van belgi gemakkelijk n staat vormen
7257497 in vlaanderen zijn de politieke en administratieve structuren aanwezig voor een ordentelijke overgang van belgi naar vlaanderen op geen enkele wijze kunnen franstaligen in de rand rond brussel aanspraak maken op het statuut van nationale minderheid het onafhankelijk vlaanderen moet waar mogelijk met nederland de krachten bundelen om samen in europa en de wereld een rol van betekenis te spelen
7257498 vlaanderen mag zich onder geen enkel beding laten opsluiten in een deelstaat die niets anders is dan een soort onderstaat
7257499 volwaardig lid is van europa en niet verstikt wordt in het europese comit van de regios
7257500 zijn we ook bereid om zonder enige vorm van misplaatst paternalisme walloni nog een tijd lang in zijn economische heropstanding te blijven steunen
7257501 slechts het brood dat wij te eten gaven zal ons verzadigen slechts de gevangene die wij verlosten zal ons bevrijden slechts het gewaad dat wij wegschonken zal ons bekleden slechts de zieke die wij bezochten zal ons genezen slechts het water dat wij te drinken gaven zal ons verkwikken slechts het woord dat leed verzachtte zal ons troosten
7257502 wat je land voor jou kan doen maar veel meer wat jij voor je land kan doen
7257503 ik licht n facet eruit vergeven is voor de mens verschrikkelijk moeilijk vergeven is een fase in het proces van verzoening vergeven is de aanspraak op vergelding laten varen vergeven is iets anders dan door de vingers zien of dan de ander excuseren degene die vergeeft mag het gedrag van die ander laakbaar blijven vinden hoe moeilijk dat ook in feite voor de betrokken dader is het kwaad an sich blijft staan als kwaad maar de dader van het kwaad wordt zijn daad vergeven en het slachtoffer rekent hem dat kwaad niet meer aan je mag het slachtoffer van een misdaad nooit pressen tot vergeven omdat je nooit kunt inschatten hoeveel hij of zij onder die misdaad heeft geleden je kunt wel bidden opdat hij of zij hiertoe de kracht vindt een volgende stap in de richting van verzoening is het berouw van de dader deze kan alleen van binnenuit tot stand komen je kunt hem of haar niet daartoe aansporen omdat het dan geen echt berouw meer kan worden de betrokkene toont tekenen van inkeer zijn gedrag verandert kan hij helpen bij de aanvaarding van zijn berouw bij het slachtoffer het slachtoffer dient dan over de brug te komen opdat het verdere proces van verzoening tot stand kan komen doorgaans is dat een moeilijk proces dat in vele gevallen niet geheel afgesloten wordt
7257504 wij leven bij de gratie van gods genade maar wij leven ook van de genade en vergeving die wij elkaar schenken wie de ware eer van god niet zoekt in het schenken van vergeving en nieuwe levenskansen kent de vader niet en is geen leerling van de zoon zo iemand is een echte zondaar en heeft nood aan bekering en vergeving
7257505 als verantwoordelijken hebben wij intensief met onze broeder en een aantal leden van zijn familie gesproken wij zijn in een zorgvuldige afweging met de betrokkenen tot de conclusie gekomen dat van een confrontatie met de directe slachtoffers tijdens de diensten geen sprake meer is
7257506 dan maar op deze manier onze kant van het verhaal naar buiten brengen
7257507 wij zijn in een zorgvuldige afweging met de betrokkenen tot de conclusie gekomen dat van een confrontatie met de directe slachtoffers tijdens de diensten geen sprake meer is
7257508 daarbij hebben wij ook vastgesteld dat er sprake is van oprecht berouw dat ook aan de betrokkenen kenbaar is gemaakt
7257509 de dader heeft berouw getoond dus moeten de slachtoffers nu ook maar vergeven
7257510 willen wij jezus volgen dan hoeden wij ons voor de zonde en is er geen oordeel
7257511 over 2 weken dient onze stamapostel in nederland een ontslapenendienst waar alle broeders en zusters van het district leeuwarden bij uitgenodigd zijn een groot voorrecht wij kunnen in deze dienst tot grote zegen zijn en daarom willen wij niet oordelen
7257512 n u kunt helaas niet terug naar de gemeenschap leeuwarden misschien in een perfecte wereld maar we leven in een gebroken wereld waarvan u ook zelf deel uitmaakt vraag aan god om vergeving de ambtsdragers zullen u thuis bezoeken u kunt cassettebandjes van de diensten krijgen desnoods kerktelefoon maar wij beschermen zoals u moet begrijpen de slachtoffers n de terecht zo gefrustreerde gemeenschap n feitelijk ook u voor teleurstelling door u de toegang tot de diensten te ontzeggen
7257513 n u kunt helaas niet terug naar de gemeenschap leeuwarden misschien in een perfecte wereld maar we leven in een gebroken wereld waarvan u ook zelf deel uitmaakt vraag aan god om vergeving de ambtsdragers zullen u thuis bezoeken u kunt cassettebandjes van de diensten krijgen desnoods kerktelefoon maar wij beschermen zoals u moet begrijpen de slachtoffers n de terecht zo gefrustreerde gemeenschap n feitelijk ook u voor teleurstelling door u de toegang tot de diensten te ontzeggen
7257514 de kerk is van mening dat seksueel misbuik een zeer ernstig vergrijp is jegens een medemens grote lichamelijke en psychische schade voor het slachtoffer tot gevolg hebbende
7257515 de kerk realiseert zich dat het slachtoffer vaak ernstige psychische lichamelijke en emotionele schade heeft opgelopen daarbij is professionele hulp in de meeste gevallen noodzakelijk daarin zal de kerk het slachtoffer volledig ondersteunen verder zal getracht worden om het slachtoffer binnen de kerk de geestelijke veiligheid te bieden die een zo voorspoedig mogelijk herstel kan bevorderen
7257516 als kerkleiding zijn wij van mening dat we een zuivere lijn van het eerder genoemde schrijven nu door moeten trekken en geen reden meer zien om iemand de toegang tot onze kerk te ontzeggen
7257517 oke ik heb spijt dan moet ik dus ook alle gevolgen van mijn daad onder ogen zien en met de beste wil van de wereld de slachtoffers uit de wind houden
7257518 de preek begon met dat deze boodschap die hij ging brengen een afgebedenzaak is
7257519 en de liefde staat opnieuw alleen en zwijgt en weent
7257520 schep o god een zuiver hart in mij vernieuw mijn geest maak mij standvastig
7257521 onze strijd is niet gericht tegen mensen maar tegen hemelse vorsten de heersers en de machthebbers van de duisternis tegen de kwade geesten in de hemelsferen
7257522 vader vergeef hun want ze weten niet wat ze doen
7257523 jezus denk aan mij wanneer u in uw koninkrijk komt
7257524 om geholpen te worden is een even zware klus als om te helpen beide vergen een actieve houding
7257525 al met al een gevaarlijk moeilijke situatie ik vind het alleen niet aan buitenstaanders om hier zolang over te discussi ren het gaat in deze topic om een drama terwijl met dat op de achtergrond over edele zaken als vergevingsgezindheid en boete doening gesproken wordt
7257526 dit was in feite ook waarom ik mij met deze discussie aanvankelijk niet wilde inlaten
7257527 iedereen zou zich achteraf op het hoofd slaan dat hij zij het niet in de gaten heeft gehad dat is de pijn die altijd uit deze situaties voortkomt
7257528 zou het niet verstandig zijn om de gehele materie leeuwarden te laten rusten en dit door de leiding van de nak in het onderdistrict leeuwarden te laten opknappen
7257529 opdat k als heer en meester mijner zinnen in t doen van uwen wil mijn vreugde vind
7257530 u zult het allemaal wel eens hebben meegemaakt dat u in de hal van een station een aantal mensen bij elkaar ziet die vermoedelijk samen een reisgezelschap vormen ze zien er ontspannen uit en staan gezellig met elkaar te praten toch zijn er ook heel veel mensen alleen op reis overal op het station lijkt het een chaos en je zou bijna denken dat in zon chaos niemand meer de weg vindt en aankomt op de plaats van zijn bestemming dan ben je vermoedelijk beter uit in een reisgezelschap want daar fungeert in de regel een ervaren reisleider die ook beschikt over een uitgewerkt reisplan aan de andere kant hoor je zelden dat mensen die alleen reizen onderweg verdwalen of hun doel missen zij vragen eventueel iets na bij een informatiebalie overleggen op het perron met een conducteur enzovoort hoe anders wordt het echter als je na een uur in de stationshal terugkeert en dan daar datzelfde reisgezelschap nog zou aantreffen kennelijk is hun reisleider niet gekomen nu kijken deze reizigers opeens vragend en onzeker alle kanten op chaotische taferelen welnu in het montessori onderwijs wordt kinderen geleerd zelfstandig naar oplossingen te zoeken dit bereidt hen voor op hun toekomst
7257531 waarheen pelgrims wilt gij trekken met uw reisstaf in de hand
7257532 neen wij vrezen geen gevaren want gods englen trekken mee
7257533 ik zeg wel eens tegen mijn zoon wanneer je bij een bedrijf werkt en het gaat daar niet goed neem dan geen ontslag probeer dat bedrijf te veranderen soms denk ik kan dat wel
7257534 de kerk is alleen een transformatorhuisje dat de krachtstroom van de man die daar in palestina in het zand schreef eerlijk verdeelt maar wat hebben ze ervan gemaakt
7257535 weet u niet dat u een tempel van god bent en dat de geest van god in uw midden woont
7257536 de volgende generatie saneert en reorganiseert splitst en fuseert het oorspronkelijke gedachtengoed
7257537 al vrij rap in 2002 ging de relatie met de nak kapot omdat de kerkleiding van mening was dat pas tot actie kon worden overgegaan hem weren uit de kerk als as was veroordeeld door een rechtbank
7257538 ap schuhmacher zei toen dat ze gerust moest deelnemen want god zal verder met je gaan
7257539 een weinig opzij te gaan om hemzelf niet het zonlicht te benemen
7257540 opdat gij mij niet ontneemt wat gij mij n et kunt geven
7257541 wat zullen wij dan hierop zeggen is god v r ons wie kan t gen ons zijn
7257542 er zijn topics waar ik niet op reageer omdat ik geen zinvolle bijdrage kan leveren
7257543 en dat niemand reageert op jouw dat zal wel een reden hebben
7257544 nee de kerk ons geloof kun je niet vergelijken met een zaak er zitten geen twee kanten aan er is geen maar
7257545 wat hier gedurig onderwerp is van wetenschappelijk onderzoek is wat helpt kinderen door de omstandigheden heen die zij hier in dit ziekenhuis meemaken wat dan telkens opnieuw uit deze onderzoeken naar voren komt is dat het hem zit in de veiligheid en de geborgenheid die ouders aan het ziekbed van hun kinderen kunnen verschaffen onze inzet is dus ervoor te zorgen dat de ouders op deze manier er voor hun kinderen kunnen zijn en waar wij voor waken is dat zij in het vervullen van die belangrijke taak dan niet verzwakken want kinderen voelen haarfijn aan of hun ouders er zijn wanneer ze er zijn of niet
7257546 ik ben maar een slachtoffer ik ben niet meester over mezelf ik ben geen volheid en dien me te vullen met anderen
7257547 ik voel me koud klein ver drietig kwetsbaar zonder liefde en ik kan slechts bestaan dankzij en via de ander
7257548 ik kan en wil niet alleen bestaan ik pak jou ik wil me verliezen pak me
7257549 denk je echt dat de ondertoon op een officieel forum positiever zou zijn
7257550 is dit normaal hier in de kerk doet ie dit bij alle meisjes doen alle dienaren dit
7257551 u heeft al een gezond kindje en denk aan hen die helemaal geen kinderen kunnen krijgen
7257552 je bent niet alleen dom maar je bent er nog eigenwijs bij ook
7257553 ik vind niet dat je van iemand kunt vragen of hij wel vergeven wil dat moet van de persoon zelf uitgaan je kunt ook niet van iemand vragen om maar te doen of er niets gebeurt is
7257554 het is noodzakelijk dat er betere procedures komen en dat dienaren die betrokken zijn bij zon zaak als eerste weten dat ze hun mond moeten dichthouden en alleen pastorale betrokkenheid moeten tonen
7257555 d waarom om te voorkomen dat het slachtoffer opnieuw geslachtofferd wordt
7257556 zolang men deze overtuiging blijft vasthouden is het trauma gewoon niet op te lossen
7257557 in dat kader is internet een niet onbelangrijk wapen in de strijd tegen geslotenheid
7257558 wat moeten wij dan overwinnen mijn vader zong ook altijd heer maak mij sterk en leer mij overwinnen hoe weten wij dat wij de goede strijd strijden
7257559 altijd weer dwaalt hun hart mijn wegen kennen ze niet
7257560 door zijn genade bent u nu immers gered dankzij uw geloof maar dat dankt u niet aan uzelf het is een geschenk van god
7257561 als men aan iets goeds werkt zal er altijd iets goeds uit voortkomen ook al is het resultaat soms anders dan was verwacht
7257562 vrede is geen asiel voor gemakzuchtigen vrede is de allerhoogste strijd
7257563 vrede laat ik u na mijn vrede geef ik u
7257564 opdat de levenden weten dat de hoogste god boven het koningschap van de mensen staat hij bepaalt wie het ambt krijgt toebedeeld zelfs de laagste onder de mensen kan daartoe verheven worden
7257565 weet u niet dat u een tempel van god bent en dat de geest van god in uw midden woont
7257566 er komt nog eens een tijd dat we de deur niet mee uit hoeven we krijgen dan tv toestellen met een ingebouwd hostiehoudertje een elektronisch signaal zorgt er dan voor dat wanneer de voorraad hosties een kritische waarde bereikt er automatisch bij de c a een bestelling wordt geplaatst per koerier worden daarop meteen de volgende dag nieuwe bij je thuis afgeleverd
7257567 leef toch zo zoals je wensen zult geleefd te hebben
7257568 dit is wat uw woorden hebben aangericht bij mijn jongste bediende
7257569 door uw ongepaste opmerking ligt nu het respect dat zijn ouders hem meegaven voor mensen van uw aanzien voorgoed aan gruzelementen
7257570 nur derjenige ist zum kritik berechtigt der eine aufgabe besser l sen kann
7257571 had je je god nu k gedankt als je kind was overleden
7257572 leef toch zo zoals je wensen zult geleefd te hebben
7257573 er is er altijd nog n die van je houdt je vader
7257574 ben je ergens waar een tv bij de hand is kijk dan nu naar dat en dat programma met een russische celloleraar
7257575 toen moet god mijn grote leraar op mijn pad hebben gestuurd aleksandr binnen twee weken speelde ik binnen twee weken ontbloeide mijn talent alsof er n knop omging er ging een wereld voor me open ik kreeg door hoe t moest en dat cello spelen n genoegen is en geen marteling ik begon boeken te lezen en regelmatig naar t theater te gaan ik werd niet gedwongen maar op t juiste spoor gezet met wijsheid liefde en enorm veel respect voor mijn persoon mijn ziel werd niet gebroken maar aan mezelf onthuld
7257576 misschien ook een idee voor de br waar deze log eigenlijk over gaat of krijg ik nu weer de hel over mij heen
7257577 ge nteresseerden zullen heus wel opzoeken in nbv het spaart jezelf veel copy paste acties uit
7257578 het spijt me voor de anderen maar is hier ook ene jan wolkers want die is uitverkoren
7257579 ik neem aan dat je laatste vraag een retorische is
7257580 weg en tot god met je goed vinden heb hem op mijn site geplaatst
7257581 doe je mond pas open wanneer wat je gaat zeggen mooier is dan de stilte ervoor
7257582 ik werd niet gedwongen maar op t juiste spoor gezet met wijsheid liefde en enorm veel respect voor mijn persoon mijn ziel werd niet gebroken maar aan mezelf onthuld
7257583 mijn broeder is zo goed als gij hoevaak hebben wij deze woorden al niet gehoord aangehaald in de dienst hoe vaak hebben wij het al niet gehoord heb uwe naasten lief gelijk uzelve dit alles projecterend op leeuwarden moeilijke opgave voor menigeen lijkt mij
7257584 wat een flauwekul waarom zouden wij dit alles moeten projecten op iemand die aan een persoonlijkheidsstoornis leidt
7257585 toch een punt om op de achtergrond te houden in ons denken en handelen en schrijven
7257586 je bent niet alleen dom maar je bent er nog eigenwijs bij ook
7257587 een gebrek aan empatisch vermogen is inderdaad onderdeel van bv een narcistische persoonlijkheid tja wat valt daar een te vergeven
7257588 als je alles in een negatief perspectief ziet dan is alles om je toe negatief
7257589 de dader ziet daar gaan we van uit de medemens eerst als een mindere ziet hij hem als gelijke dan is er een lichtpunt
7257590 kenmerk van een psychopatische persoonlijkheid is dat de andere mens alleen belangrijk is als het in je kraam van pas komt
7257591 hoe kan ik oprecht zijn als ik nijn innerlijk leven voortdurend verander om het in overeenstemming te brengen met de schaduw van wat ik meen dat anderen van mij verwachten anderen hebben geen recht om van mij te verlangen dat ik iets anders ben dan wat ik moet zijn in gods ogen er kan van een mens niets groters gevraagd worden dit is het enige wat god van mij verwacht het enige wat ik moet doen maar het is ook het enige waarvan niemand verwacht dat ik het zal doen men wenst dat ik zou zijn zoals men me ziet een verlengstuk van henzelf zij beseffen niet dat door volkomen mezelf te zijn mijn leven als een aanvulling en een voleinding is van hun leven als ik enkel leef als hun schaduw zal ik alleeen maar dienen om hen te herinneren aan hun eigen onvolkomenheid als ik alleeen maar word zoals anderen mij denken dan zal god tot mij moeten zeggen ik ken u niet
7257592 kenmerk van een als je naaste in reactie van 17 11 uur
7257593 nu moeten jullie niet denken dat ik een verbitterd iemand ben dat is niet het geval
7257594 in mijn praktijk komen mensen die met hun emoties in de knel zitten
7257595 vergeven en vertrouwen zijn twee begrippen die vaak met elkaar worden verward wanneer iemand je meerdere malen heeft bedrogen kun je deze persoon vergeven hebben terwijl je hem nog niet vertrouwt weten dat iemand je vaak heeft bedrogen is te vergelijken met weten dat van een bepaalde stoel n poot niet deugt als je weet dat een stoel niet stevig is kun je er beter niet op gaan zitten
7257596 vage gast ik wilde simpelweg de stem uit het noorden laten spreken
7257597 de vraag is dan aan de orde hoe de kerkenraad kan bijdragen aan het doorbreken van de machtsverhouding aan het scheppen van een veilige ruimte waarin de vrouw op adem kan komen aan een kritisch zelfonderzoek ook in dit perspectief staat de gemeenschap zelf ter discussie haar manier van omgaan met machtsverhoudingen de mechanismen die slachtoffers gevangen kunnen houden in hun onderdrukte positie
7257598 hoe herstel je dan het verbroken vertrouwen na de aangerichte verwoestingen bij hen die het aangaat
7257599 hoe herstel je dan het verbroken vertrouwen na de aangerichte verwoestingen bij hen die het aangaat
7257600 maar aan de andere kant krijg ik veel priv e mails van apostolen die blij zijn dat ik dingen verwoord die zij net zo ervaren maar niet durven te zeggen uit angst voor br en zr en dienaren uit de kerk
7257601 jullie hebben de hemel al geclaimd en nu claim je ook nog deze site
7257602 ich bin mitglied 98 unterbezirk 5 bezirk 8 un gebietskirche 14 unter bezirksapostel x im himmel gibt es doch keinen speziellen eingang f r amtstr ger und k nstler oder so es kommt nicht darauf an was jemanden gerade ist sondern wer
7257603 jack jongen maak even tijd om bij te kletsen met marijke
7257604 ik vind geloven in iemand die alles bestiert tamelijk infantiel het is een regressief kinderlijk verlangen
7257605 in veendam was het een soort clan vorming de expliciet vromen vormden een kamp
7257606 heb me altijd kostelijk vermaakt in het niet strebers kamp
7257607 je was goed apostolische of je was niet goed apostolische
7257608 als je b v niet in het koor wilde of niet mee ging pionieren werd je daar wel op aan gekeken en dat is toch best ernstig te noemen
7257609 hij slaat rechts of links af waar hij naar boven moet gaan om meer van het geheel te gaan zien
7257610 wie zich aan de wet houdt doet niet automatisch iets goeds
7257611 ik vind geloven in iemand die alles bestiert tamelijk infantiel het is een regressief kinderlijk verlangen
7257612 een emotionele toestand van iemand die belemmerd wordt in de verwezenlijking van zijn verwachtingen of behoeften
7257613 link katholiek apostolische kerk nak exclusiviteit vergeving en nog een paar anderen
7257614 een kerk die pretendeert het uitverkoren volk van god te zijn en de bruid van jezus te zijn en die dat in alle uithoeken van de wereld als waarheid verkondigt rustig hard aan mag pakken
7257615 momenteel wordt er druk gewerkt aan een boek over de nak in het district utrecht
7257616 onder meer met intervieuws met verschillende districtsvoorgangers voorgangers musici en grondpersoneel verwachte verschijning eing maart 2006
7257617 vage gast wat is er met jou aan de hand je lijkt mij wel
7257618 allerlei fanatiekelingen zij waren naar mijn idee ook gevangen in een systeem
7257619 vroeger dacht ik dat de kerk synoniem was aan geloven nu niet meer de betrokkenheid van ex nak ers is volgens mij in de eerste plaats een gevoel van teleurstelling in de nak als kerkelijk instituut en uitdrager van het geloof daarnaast worstelen volgens mij erg veel nak ers en niet nak ers met het geloof an sich
7257620 vage gast daar had je bij de nak een flinke kettingzaag voor nodig
7257621 toen ik afstand nam van de kerk in vdam kwam er voor mij de ruimte en de rust om me ongestoord in god en het geloof te verdiepen ik de nak had ik alleen maar regeltjes geleerd
7257622 hij was atheist maar hij deed er de laatste tijd niet zoveel meer aan
7257623 ik doel dan op de bekende uitspraak dat er voor organisten en dirigenten een aparte hemel zou zijn
7257624 dezulken hopen inderdaad een eigen eregalerij te hebben deze had zich een eigen status aangemeten
7257625 ik zal het je eerlijk zeggen maar in de afgelopen week heb ik enkele dagen niet gevolgd maar gelukkig heeft niemand dat opgemerkt
7257626 dit heb ik 7 weken lang vol gehouden tot mijn vrouw die wel trouw volgt ineens thuis kwam en de groeten meenam
7257627 wanneer ik al de bovenstaande soms onzinnige stukjes lees dank ik god op mijn blote knie n dat ik
7257628 en dan weer dit en dan weer dat zo is er altijd wel weer wat
7257629 maar er zijn ook mensen die deze beide mogelijkheden verwerpen en blijven doorvragen altijd op zoek naar antwoorden
7257630 wij zijn niet nieuw apostolisch geworden en gebleven om regelmatig te worden herinnerd aan bepaalde bijbelfragmenten met het oog op een onbezorgde toekomst of zo maar om levende bouwstenen te zijn in zijn werk tot verlossing en tot heil van onszelf n van anderen met wie wij zijn liefde mogen delen
7257631 vandaar het is bedoeld om te troosten voor die hun dierbaren er mee hebben verloren
7257632 met verbzing heb ik de londonberichten gelezen kan dat misschien ook op een normale minder psychotische manier

7257634 alles het gevolg van verkeerde volgorde eerst boos worden en dan onderzoeken nadenken als je nou eerst zoekt en nadenkt is boos worden altijd nog een optie boos worden levert meestal niet zoveel op zorgen maken ook niet
7257635 mooie citaten maar wijst u hiermee naar de ontwikkelingen in het forum hoe vindt u het forum
7257636 i thought i was out but they pulled me back
7257637 slachtoffer geweest slachtoffer zet ik bewust tussen aanhalingstekens omdat ik dit een verschrikkelijk woord vind het plaatst je in hokje terwijl je zoveel meer bent
7257638 ik bid voor jullie dat je de kracht mag vinden om dit te verwerken
7257639 ga naar af en schaamt u voor alle gelovigen meng je niet in deze discussie voor alle niet gelovigen jullie zijn klaar
7257640 de natuurwetenschappelijke ordening is ook maar een accident onze ordening verwdijnt in het niet tegen alles dat we niet weten ja waarachtig wat we ook doen we zijn de eeuwig bedrogenen van het universum
7257641 en zalig is hij die zich aan mij niet ergert
7257642 wie zulk een kind aanneemt in mijnen naam die neemt mij aan
7257643 toch is je opmerking niet op zijn plaats in deze specifieke discussie want wij praten er juist over wat al deze chaos met ons doet en wat ons antwoord is op deze verschrikkingen
7257644 men dronk een glas deed een plas en liet alles zoals het was
7257645 u gelooft toch niet dat wij op een zacht zuidenwindje de hemel worden binnengevoerd
7257646 aan de andere kant vind ik het ook niet goed als slachtoffers te lang als slachtoffer geobjectiveerd worden ik denk dat we daar ook voor op moeten passen
7257647 het leven bestaat niet alleen uit de gevolgen van nare voorvallen
7257648 we moeten overleven in dit aardse tranendal en straks naar onze heerlijke toekomst
7257649 hallo de hemel begint hier en nu en wat je kan bijdragen om dat tot stand te brengen moet je doen
7257650 der von gott erw hlte bevollm chtigte jesu christi in seiner kirche der berechtigt ist durch die kraft des heiligen geistes und im namen jesu menschen mit gott zu vers hnen
7257651 ik pas me aan jullie woorden aan en zeg volgen i
7257652 leidinggevenden de blik op oneindig alle overigen het verstand op nul
7257653 welvaart meet je af aan hoe men omgaat met de zwaksten
7257654 hoe mooi is het je eigen overtuiging uit de mond van iemand anders te vernemen
7257655 de gemeente van christus is echt wel wat anders dan zoals ik hier ergens las een gezelschap van treinreizigers met onder hen voldoende dwarsliggers elke vergelijking in dit verband haalt het ongekend verstrekkende belang van het werk van zijn handen naar beneden
7257656 de ruimte om jezelf te zijn en jezelf te ontplooien die is in kerken nogal eens afwezig
7257657 ik werd niet gedwongen maar op t juiste spoor gezet met wijsheid liefde en enorm veel respect voor mijn persoon mijn ziel werd niet gebroken maar aan mezelf onthuld
7257658 wat vind je van het vergelijk dat het spoor niet bij elkaar te houden is zonder de dwarsliggers
7257659 mensen moeten beseffen dat ze oneindig van elkaar gescheiden zijn en als ze in staat zijn dat te beseffen dan kunnen ze op een wonderlijke manier samen zijn en naast elkaar leven
7257660 het ligt niet aan de kerken of de kerkleden dat er weinig ruimte is voor zelfontplooiing
7257661 als ik over mijn eigen remmingen spreek dan weet ik ook dat een deel van de oorzaak in mezelf schuilt ik moet aan mezelf werken om te groeien en het mogelijk te maken dat er van enige ontplooiing sprake kan zijn
7257662 ook dwarsliggers zijn volgens mij noodzakelijk al is het maar om de boel op scherp te houden als ze het geheel maar niet ontwrichten maar dan zijn het ook geen dwarsliggers meer eerder obstakels op het spoor die de trein doen ontsporen met alle gevolgen van dien
7257663 ook het voorbeeld van die rijdende trein ik zou zeggen heeft niemand in de gaten dat er aan de handrem is getrokken waardoor die hele trein al een tijd stilstaat en veel reizigers uitstappen
7257664 men leeft als mens in de natuurwetenschappelijke ordening maar ook deze ordening is slechts een accident onze ordening verdwijnt in het niet tegen alles dat wij niet weten ja waarachtig wat we ook doen we zijn de eeuwige bedrogenen van het universum
7257665 verder zie je dat kerk en religie steeds achter de wetenschappelijke ontwikkeling aanholt
7257666 maar kijk nu eens naar al die diep ongelukkige fundamentalisten vaak zeer weerloze figuren
7257667 doel je op mijn bericht dat mijn vader nu precies een jaar geleden overleden is
7257668 maar waren jullie niet eigenlijk geanimeerd met elkaar in gesprek
7257669 bedoel je niet dat boek wij friezen knibbelje allinig foar god ofzo
7257670 momenteel wordt er druk gewerkt aan een boek over de nak in het district utrecht
7257671 onder meer met intervieuws met verschillende districtsvoorgangers voorgangers musici en grondpersoneel
7257672 ik heb mij totaal niet gerealiseerd dat dit door forumdeelnemers zo opgevat zou worden
7257673 een zegenaar is voor mij iemand door wie ik word gezegend niet iemand die zich als zodanig aan mij voorstelt
7257674 laten wij naast al het negatieve in het heden en voor de toekomst ons openstellen voor het woord dat dit tot een plaats mag verkrijgen in ons aller ziel ik zal in ieder geval voor u allen bidden
7257675 ik kan je even niet volgens wanneer je schrijft dat wij het gouden kalf aan het bouwen zijn
7257676 zou je zo vriendelijk willen zijn om mij dat dan uit de doeken te doen ik ben wel benieuwd waar je stem uit het noorden dan precies op doelt
7257677 die verantwortung des eigenen lebens vor gott zu bernehmen gegen ber den anderen und vor allem vor sich selbst
7257678 ik heb geprobeerd van degenen tegen wie ik uitkwam de goede kwaliteiten over te nemen
7257679 volgens mij heeft jezus je heel andere dingen geleerd m b t het autoverhaal
7257680 maar van zijn eigen kinderen mag je op een ander vlak toch het zelfde verwachten dunkt mij
7257681 wat denk je dan wat god zou doen als als een kind om hulp roept het is mijn kind niet ik kijk een andere kant op natuurlijk niet hij redt
7257682 als men denkt of vind dat jack iets verkeerds zegt
7257683 je kunt geloviger zijn dan de gemiddelde nak er als je je niet commiteert aan een menselijk protocolletje je laat je bijvoorbeeld niet in het zwart wit confirmeren dan duikt de halve goegemeente over je heen
7257684 en ook vind ik dat je ook niet hyperallergisch voor protocollen moet worden
7257685 vandaag vroeg ik mij af waarom jezus ieders dienstknecht wilde zijn
7257686 ik neem aan dat het jouw geloof niet heeft aangetast getuige alles wat je inbrengt maar heeft het instituut nak niet aan waarde ingeboet of ben je niet door een geloofsdal gegaan tav van het instituut nak
7257687 als dienaar moet je als het ware een gezondheidsmedewerker van alle markten thuis zijn
7257688 door de dwaasheid der prediking zalig te maken degene die geloven
7257689 dan valt een ongekunstelde verkondiging van het woord door eenvoudige mensen vaak niet in de smaak van iemand die door opleiding studie en beroep gewend is eigenlijk alle onderwerpen kritisch te benaderen
7257690 vandaar dat ik de nak ballast maar van me heb afgegooid en sindsdien kon mn geloof vrij groeien zoiets als de lamp onder de korenmaat
7257691 god doet alle dingen medewerken ten goede maar hoe een karakter vormen is geen goedkope zaak
7257692 in hoeverre kan geloof dat persoonlijk is losgekoppeld worden van een instituut
7257693 om geloof te belijden hebben we medestanders nodig om te delen en rituelen nodig om de hoogste gevoelens op te roepen en levend te maken dat zou men moeten zoeken op de plaats die het beste past
7257694 heeft het instituut kerk niet per definitie een beperkende invloed dat is ook het probleem dat steeds wordt aangegeven als aangegeven wordt dat er ter kerke gegaan wordt
7257695 aan de andere kant hoe bereik je vrijheid in het leven in plaats van schijn vrijheid
7257696 wijzen uit het oosten op derk blink g mik e v d velde en nu e bontjer
7257697 wij zijn op de weg ten leven die een school der vorming is
7257698 vage gast heeft berhaupt nog niet gereageerd op de vraag of hij met de 4 wijzen de bij naam genoemde personen bedoelt
7257699 ga er maar aan staan om voor het district lwarden de verantwoording te dragen
7257700 ik kan me nog de enorme desillusie herinneren van de mensen toen b van zn sokkel donderde
7257701 fouten maken is erg geen fouten maken is nog erger want dan doe je niks
7257702 en dat ik achteraan zat maakt mij echt totaal niets uit
7257703 dat is volgens mij het allerbelangrijkste punt wat al in gang is gezet maar wat verder moet worden ontwikkeld
7257704 wat is de taak van een distr evangelist antw hij is zijn districtsoudste behulpzaam bij de arbeid in het district en is tevens zijn plaatsvervanger
7257705 geschiedenis is het belangrijkste vak op school het leert je de fouten te zien in het verleden je standpunt te bepalen in het heden en je pad uit te stippelen naar de toekomst
7257706 vage gast wat is het verschil tussen een dienende broeder en een ambtsbroeder
7257707 geschiedenis is het belangrijkste vak op school het leert je de fouten te zien in het verleden je standpunt te bepalen in het heden en je pad uit te stippelen naar de toekomst
7257708 als u mij niet ondersteunt en voor mij geen biddende handen hebt kan ik mijn opdracht niet vervullen
7257709 dan dingen te weten komt die je helemaal niet wilt weten
7257710 maar dan nog wil ik mij richten op de twee laatste gedeeltes van het citaat van apostel sepers
7257711 is er op dit moment in jullie ogen een dienaar in welk ambt dan ook die wel deze capaciteiten heeft zitten er in onze kerk te veel mensen op de verkeerde plek
7257712 districtsapostel de bruijn die zeer goed was ge nformeerd over deze affaire heeft nimmer publiekelijk tijdens een kerkdienst de leeuwarder gemeenteleden en ambtsdragers in ruste tot de orde geroepen
7257713 wij worden niet op een zacht zuidenwindje de hemel binnengevoerd
7257714 geschiedenis is het belangrijkste vak op school het leert je de fouten te zien in het verleden je standpunt te bepalen in het heden en je pad uit te stippelen naar de toekomst
7257715 nu is die liefde ondanks alle ellende weer terug de warmte is er weer leeuwarden is weer een fijne gemeenschap aan het worden
7257716 dat hoeft n m m voor wie eenmaal het evangelie van christus goed op het spoor is gekomen niet per se zo te zijn gemeenschap kan verrijkend werken vgl hand 2 42
7257717 wat is gemeenschap eigenlijk samen bidden brood breken trouw aan het onderricht de leer
7257718 nu pas dringt het tot mij door wat dat lied betekent waar in staat dat wie met tranen zaaien juichend zullen maaien
7257719 zo denk ik in friesland aan priester broersma dat hij niet meer volgt doet er voor mij niet toe hij blijft mijn voorbeeld
7257720 webhuis aan ons terbeschikking gesteld doet me denken aan een bijbeltekst laten we oom gerrit niet teleurgesteld maken
7257721 in hoeverre kan geloof dat persoonlijk is losgekoppeld worden van een instituut
7257722 men leeft als mens in de natuurwetenschappelijke ordening maar ook deze ordening is slechts een accident onze ordening verdwijnt in het niet tegen alles dat wij niet weten ja waarachtig wat we ook doen we zijn de eeuwige bedrogenen van het universum
7257723 aber etwas hat mich heute morgen noch viel viel mehr in meiner seele bewegt als unser stammapostel in den eingang trat wo die lieben vorsteher waren haben sie den stammapostel begr t und da wussten und f hlten sie jetzt kommt der herr in unsere mitte ich habe in vielen augen eurer treuen vorsteher die euch versorgen hier in diesen gemeinden des bezirkes pasewalk ich habe in ihre augen gesehen und viele lasst mich das so sagen waren mit tr nen erf llt tr nen der freude freude des herzens der herr kehrt ein bei uns und ich habe das bei unserem stammapostel so gef hlt wie damals jesus ins schiff trat die j nger haben sich gef rchtet unser stammapostel hat uns zugerufen f rchte dich nicht glaube nur
7257724 wollen sie mithelfen dass die braut christi bereitet wird dass der herr kommen kann und vollenden kann wenn sie darin t tig sein wollen und ihr ganzes herze hineinlegen wollen und aufschauen wollen allezeit zum herrn im stammapostel sic dann bekunden sie das bitte vor der gemeinde mit einem ehrlichen und aufrichtigen ja
7257725 dat ze wel zeggen zullen dat ze het anders bedoeld hebben
7257726 tjonge jonge hier achter de klapjap en dat waren in mijn beleving nogal eens zaken waarbij mensen onrecht is aangedaan
7257727 laat maar van je horen zeg maar hoe jij er over denkt
7257728 ja hij gebruikte woorden uit het verleden en ik dacht dat we daarvan hadden geleerd
7257729 ja hij gebruikte woorden uit het verleden en ik dacht dat we daar van hadden geleerd
7257730 wie een kuil graaft voor een ander valt er zelf in
7257731 er zijn geen andere waarden en normen men gaat er alleen anders mee om
7257732 wat gij niet wilt dat u geschiedt doe dat ook een ander niet
7257733 de definitie van rietdijk ziet religie als een schil ik zie religie als kern
7257734 luid huilen je verdriet uitschreeuwen stiekem vinden we dat ongepast
7257735 zonder voelen leerden ze nooit wat de dommen de onverschilligen de anderen
7257736 met jou wil ik nog wel eens om de tafel
7257737 en nu zeg ik u gij zijt petrus en op deze steenrots zal ik mijne gemeente bouwen en de poorten der hel zullen haar niet overweldigen
7257738 met grote aarzeling werd pas veel later op 10 januari 1949 de naam catholic apostolic church aangenomen
7257739 als je zo naar buiten kijkt kun je wel zien dat alles er niet zo maar vanzelf is gekomen er is een grote veroorzaker
7257740 alle goede gedachten in de wereld zouden aan de apostel getoetst moeten worden
7257741 deze volkskrantblog heb ik wat doorgenomen maar met naf fora bedoel je nak fora
7257742 zij stelden het getuigenis van de apostelen aan de hoofden der kerk en der christenheid op kortweg het testimonium genoemd de kerk en de staat waren verworpen en de enige uitweg was de apostelen te erkennen en hun aanwijzingen tot herstel te volgen
7257743 wat vinden jullie van de opvattingen van de nak zoals je ze leest in de andere log
7257744 wat blijft er nog over van onze identiteit als we de exclusiviteit opgeven
7257745 ik ben zelf nieuw apostolisch maar heb absoluut niet de overtuiging dat
7257746 let wel dus alleen het l tste woord zal genade zijn daarv r zullen we dus nog heel veel werk zelf moeten verzetten om berhaupt maar aan dat laatste woord toe te komen
7257747 we spelen eigenlijk gewoon het zelfde spelletje en er is geen argument om zelfstandig door te gaan
7257748 trouwens met relativisten bedoel ik degenen die ernstige wantoestanden proberen goed te praten of afdoen door te zeggen dat er overal wel wat is
7257749 ik hoorde vanmiddag dat gerrit sepers dinsdagavond 24 januari aanstaande de europese informatie avond niet zal bijwonen is dit bericht gerucht juist
7257750 in de algemene christenheid geldt dat bij de heilige waterdoop ook de heilige geest of afgedragen of geactiveerd wordt
7257751 hebben diegene die door apostel sepers zijn verzegeld nu wel of niet de heilige geest ontvangen of was de heilige geest al eerder ontvangen bij de heilige waterdoop
7257752 jij bent mijn geliefde zoon in jou vind ik vreugde
7257753 tegen ongerechtigheid kun je je weren tegen domheid is geen kruid gewassen
7257754 alle mensen buiten de nak zalig kunnen worden maar dat is wel na het duizenjarig vredesrijk
7257755 komt allen tot mij gij die belast vermoeid en beladen zijt
7257756 gemeenschap van degenen die in christus geloven en hem belijden
7257757 hij hield van v l bloemen k van v 314 dieren en hij hield k van v l mensen
7257758 veel letters zijn niet om van te houden maar om te communiceren
7257759 ik denk dan ook dat de erfgenamen eerder last hebben van een mischien geringe erfenis
7257760 als 10 waar is wat daar staat dan is het al heel erg
7257761 de zegen van de heer zij met jullie zoals hij het zou willen
7257762 nu ja ook de schoonvader van leber friedrich bischoff was van mening dat wij alles in geloof zouden aanvaarden
7257763 en niet de smoes dat god zijn plan gewijzigd heeft want dat heeft hij nog nooit gedaan
7257764 alles wisselt op zijn wenken maar god zelf verandert niet
7257765 jullie zijn door mijn vader gezegend kom en neem deel aan het koninkrijk dat al sinds de grondvesting van de wereld voor jullie bestemd is
7257766 klop het stof van uw kleren en wens iedereen wat ook zijn jongeren zeiden
7257767 de bijbel verwijst de mens naar gods onmacht en lijden alleen de lijdende god kan helpen
7257768 wezenlijk voor hem is dat hij niet alleen maar in zijn christologische benadering de weg terug vindt naar de traditie van de kerk der eeuwen maar dat hij die zo toespitst dat het geen dogma is
7257769 zo schept de oproep tot navolging dadelijk een nieuwe situatie in de oude situatie blijven en toch navolgen sluiten elkaar uit
7257770 dit is voor mij het einde van het leven maar ook het begin ervan
7257771 brengt vader mij weer naar huis k mag dan aanschouwen t heerlijke licht daaruit blinkt vaders vriendlijk gezicht
7257772 gottes wege k nnen ins dunkel f hren sie enden aber im licht
7257773 aan de goddelijke inhoud van de boodschap bischof niet kan worden getwijfeld
7257774 op de dag der eerste opstanding zullen wij allemaal duidelijkheid ontvangen
7257775 het is de stamapostel van belang om u alleen maar kort te antwoorden
7257776 hoeveel meer zal t de heer onze god behagen als wij samen vragen
7257777 waarom lijkt het toch dat geen enkel lid zich druk maakt over deze kwestie
7257778 gelijk de vader mij gezonden heeft zo zend ik ook u
7257779 ik bid ook voor degenen die door hun woord in mij geloven zullen
7257780 het belangrijkste is ook vandaag diegenen te geloven die god zendt wanneer men dat doet kan men gods zegen naar zich toe trekken en toebereid worden voor de eeuwige gemeenschap met de drie enige god
7257781 woorden zijn als druppels het voortdurend vallen van druppels heeft een enorm effec
7257782 ga bewust van t hemels doel godskind door dit aards gewoel
7257783 vreemd maar ik moet ineens denken aan eenlied uit ons oude
7257784 ziet hoe goed en hoe liefelijk is het dat broeders ook samenwonen
7257785 hoe goed en lieflijk als onder broeders en onder zusters de eendracht woont
7257786 o heer laat liefde en eendracht heersen waar broeders wonen waar zusters zijn
7257787 onze verhouding tot god is geen religieuze verhouding tot het hoogste denkbare machtigste verhevenste wezen
7257788 onze verhouding tot god is een nieuw leven gericht op het er zijn voor anderen deelnemend aan het bestaan van jezus
7257789 de bijbel verwijst de mens naar gods onmacht en lijden alleen de lijdende god kan helpen
7257790 zeker is wel dat het omhelzen van bonhoeffers lijdende god gelovigen en theologen vervreemdt van de traditionele kerken en het traditionele geloof
7257791 wie een lijdende god belijdt weet niet meer zo goed wat de zin van zoveel menselijk lijden is en dat is een handicap voor de bereidwillig een goedbedoelende trooster voor de beroepshelper en de ongeschoolde ziekenbezoeker
7257792 geest van liefde die sterk is als de dood en het uiteindelijk wint tenminste dat hoop ik van een lijdende god
7257793 naar mijn idee heeft de mens in bepaalde zin een zeer beperkte keuzevrijheid
7257794 er zijn binnen onze kerk ook mensen die anders over deze thematiek denken zijn zij dan ook welkom selbstverstandlich voor hen moeten we ook een veilig thuis zijn
7257795 krachtige geest het onbegrijpbare geheel van een zon grote liefde die sterk is als de dood en het uiteindelijk wint tenminste zo zie ik het en daardoor een lijdende god is een die alles geleidt en een die lijdt voor ons mensdom
7257796 hier heb ik van gedroomd maar het werd pas later werkelijkheid
7257797 beste rob bedankt voor je bericht voor mij was direct al duidelijk dat je niet de schrijver was van het gewraakte bericht sommigen menen de vrijheid van meningsuiting te mogen gebruiken om anderen willens en wetens te krenken het siert een lid van de z g bruidsgemeente geenszins het is een vorm van domheid die het gevolg van de uitwerking van de exclusiviteitsgedachten zulke lieden bevestigen alleen maar mijn stellingen inzake de problematieken in en ronde de nak ronduit tragisch
7257798 ik vermoed dat betrokkene vooraan in de kerk zijn haar plaats inneemt
7257799 voorzover ik kan nagaan heeft betrokkene zich onder dit huidige ip adres nog niet eerder gemeld op deze thread dit ter geruststelling voor de overige schijvers
7257800 ik vermoed dat betrokkene vooraan in de kerk zijn haar plaats inneemt
7257801 voorzover ik kan nagaan heeft betrokkene zich onder dit huidige ip adres nog niet eerder gemeld op deze thread dit ter geruststelling voor de overige schijvers
7257802 weet ook ik niet waarom je zo reageerd maar het antwoord bevreemd mij inmiddels al niet meer
7257803 omkering van de moraal de arenden zeggen met nadruk wel van de lammetjes te houden vooral als ze zo sappig en mals zijn
7257804 zittend vanuit een leunstoel vanuit de hemel op ons neer kijkt
7257805 nou het project mens is gewoon mislukt jammer ik heb dat kennelijk verkeerd ingeschat toen ik ermee begon
7257806 ik heb er spijt van dat ik mensen heb gemaakt
7257807 maar ook in het kleine en toch lijkt het wel of het allemaal nauwelijks effect heeft
7257808 heb god lief boven alles en u naaste als uzelve
7257809 jij hebt de kroon des leven van je hoofd laten roven
7257810 je geeft daarmee voer aan een ieder die de nak in een kwaad daglicht wil stellen
7257811 de ware antichrist vind je onder de leden van het koor de ouderlingen en de andere
7257812 staande met het gezicht naar de blauwe wolken terwijl miljoenen werden afgeslacht
7257813 je kunt de waarheid niet beredeneren je kunt de waarheid alleen aanvoelen
7257814 dominee hieleman was tot ver in de omgeving populair vrouwen hadden zijn portret thuis op de schoorsteen staan
7257815 alle mensen hebben gezondigd en moeten het stellen zonder gods heerlijke aanwezigheid
7257816 zie hier de dienstmaagd des heren mij geschiede naar uw woord
7257817 waarheen ga je wat ga je met je leven doen
7257818 u zegt alles is mij toegestaan maar niet alles is goed voor u
7257819 er staat geschreven niet alleen van brood zal de mens leven maar van alle woord dat uit de mond gods uitgaat
7257820 de kinderen van deze wereld gaan ten aanzien van hun geslacht met veel meer overleg te werk dan de kinderen van het licht
7257821 niettemin wanneer ik hem in amsterdam zou tegenkomen zou ik hem zeker de hand schudden
7257822 vorweg mir hat weder apostel erich noch der bezirksapostel jemals etwas ungutes angetan und es geht mir auch nicht um meinungsmache
7257823 ich habe mit der nak gelitten ich habe f r die nak gelitten ich habe in der nak gelitten und ich habe durch die nak gelitten
7257824 wij zijn niet van deze wereld en kijken geen t
7257825 is er inderdaad geweest ik weet dat deze geboden om ze zo te noemen
7257826 is het zo dat al deze zaken zijn afgedwongen door de leden zelf en dat de kerkleiding helemaal niet zo happig op al deze openheid
7257827 u ere und innere voraussetzungen f r den ffnungsprozess und die neueren entwicklungen
7257828 viele entwicklungen der letzten jahre sind das ergebnis einer solchen projektgruppenarbeit
7257829 aber auch nicht deutlich umrissen da bestimmte spezifika der neuapostolischen glaubenslehre eben nicht klar und deutlich benannt werden und also auch nicht f r jeden erkennbar und unverwechselbar
7257830 die ersten artikel des neuap glaubensbekenntnisses anm gk die auf den altkirchlichen bekenntnissen beruhen werden sehr ausf hrlich dargestellt die bedeutung der apostellehre die einen elementaren bestandteil der neuapostolischen glaubenslehre darstellt und die bedeutung des apostelamtes das konstitutiv f r die nak ist werden jedoch nicht in der gleichen deutlichkeit beschrieben
7257831 die plakate zeigten bilder aus dem alltagsgeschehen und verbanden diese mit fragen die auf den glauben zielten ohne dabei spezifisch neuapostolische inhalte zu vermitteln dabei wurde eine sehr moderne ausdrucksweise gew hlt die von der gewohnten gestaltungsweise neuapostolischer publikationen und materialen abwich
7257832 entweder natur und landschaftsbilder oder bilder und szenen aus dem leben der glaubensgemeinschaft
7257833 etwas klassischer gehalten was sicherlich auch darauf zur ckzuf hren
7257834 dass nicht alle nak mitglieder gleicherma en von der modernen aufmachung der ersten plakatserie begeistert waren
7257835 alte und neue zeit ein beitrag zur entwicklungsgeschichte der neuapostolischen kirche
7257836 durch ihre beteiligung an ffentlichen vortr gen u nimmt die gemeinschaft nicht nur am ffentlichen dialog teil sondern setzt sich vor allem auch der kritischen diskussion aus
7257837 ohne die mitwirkung eines gottesboten ist der rechtsg ltige abschluss des taufbundes unm glich
7257838 die wassertaufe die in einer anderen christlichen gemeinschaft oder kirche im dreieinigen namen gottes empfangen wurde wird von der neuapostolischen kirche als ein f r diese gemeinschaft g ltiges sakrament anerkannt
7257839 in denen b cher verhandelt wurden die sich kritisch mit der neuapostolischen kirche auseinandersetzen
7257840 diskussionsforum mit seiner offenen gespr chs und streitkultur insbesondere in verbindung mit einer offiziellen kirchlichen publikation
7257841 mittlerweile sind viele publikationen auch f r au enstehende direkt beim verlag erh ltlich auch daran l sst sich die ffnung der neuapostolischen kirche ablesen
7257842 eine beteiligung der nak an einem kumenischen gottesdienst ging scheinbar weit ber das hinaus was von der kirchenf hrung zu diesem zeitpunkt als m glich erachtet wurde
7257843 zwar wird in den hausregeln und in den fragen und antworten darauf hingewiesen dass andere religi se ansichten nicht abgewertet oder herabgesetzt werden sollen diese gem igte haltung steht jedoch in klarem widerspruch zu der auffassung sich auf dem einzig richtigen zur erl sung f hrenden glaubensweg zu befinden
7257844 wenn nun der neue kurs der kirchenleitung kumenische tendenzen beinhaltet und also notwendigerweise das neuapostolische exklusivit tsverst ndnis aufgegeben werden m sste dann ist eine verunsicherung gerade in konservativen mitgliederkreisen nicht erstaunlich daher wird von der kirchenf hrung immer wieder betont dass alle kumenischen berlegungen von dem gedanken geleitet seien die neuapostolische identit tund das glaubensm ige selbstverst ndnis zu wahren
7257845 wie gott seine beziehung zu menschen anderer religionen und glaubensrichtungen die auch geglaubt gebetet und geopfert haben und auf ihre weise nachgefolgt sind gestalten wird berlassen wir seiner unantastbaren gerechtigkeit in der es auch f r andere menschen eine erf llung geben wird
7257846 inwieweit die gerechtigkeit gottes andere wege als die biblisch geschilderten geht entzieht sich unserer beurteilung doch als neuapostolische kirche halten wir fest was jesus selbst an aufgaben in das apostelamt weitergab alle welt zu lehren in seinem namen zu taufen sein wort zu predigen und in seinem namen s nden zu vergeben
7257847 solange sich die in pers nlichen und offiziellen gespr chen gegebenen antworten nicht in offiziellen f r die gesamte nak g ltigen verlautbarungen wiederfinden solange die aussagen ob nun bewusst oder nicht widerspr chlich oder uneindeutig sind solange man der kirchenleitung also t uschungsversuche oder ausweichman ver unterstellen kann bleiben nicht nur bei den gl ubigen unsicherheit und skepsis bestehen
7257848 liebe geschwister und wer den heiligen geist will der kann wegen mir nach rom reisen oder zum dalai lama in den himalaja oder wei der kuckuck wohin er wird diesen geist nicht empfangen es sei denn durch die gesandten apostel jesu christi
7257849 welchen eindruck die diskrepanz zwischen aussagen ein und derselben person hinterl sst der eine gewisse autorit t zukommt
7257850 die frage ob den gemachten aussagen der kirchenleitung berhaupt verbindlichkeit zukomme
7257851 die bestrebungen der neuapostolischen kirchenleitung den dialog mit anderen apostolischen gemeinschaften anzuregen kann als schritt verstanden werden die eigene vergangenheit aufzuarbeiten
7257852 dass die nak bisher eine eher unkritische beziehungsweise idealisierende haltung gegen ber der eigenen geschichte hatte
7257853 haupt der kirche christi ist jesus der sohn gottes der stammapostel ist das haupt aller apostel jesu
7257854 der stammapostel ist als das sichtbare haupt der kirche jesu christi in allen ihren angelegenheiten oberste instanz
7257855 hier handelt es sich um eine gravierende inhaltliche nderung da die person jesus christus mehr als bisher in den mittelpunkt ger ckt wird und die positionen von jesus christus und dem stammapostel deutlicher von einander geschieden werden
7257856 diese nderungsmitteilung richtet sich nur an die amtstr ger nicht aber an die anderen mitglieder der nak es mu daher offen bleiben ob den gl ubigen die volle bedeutung der nderung bewusst ist bzw ob ihnen diese tatsache berhaupt bekannt ist
7257857 sondern auch die menschen die zwar nicht durch einen apostel versiegelt
7257858 unter der herrschaft des satans ihr bekenntnis zu jesus christus mit dem leben bezahlt
7257859 dass der neuapostolische weg nicht der einzige weg ist um das ziel die teilnahme an der ersten auferstehung zu erreichen
7257860 dass das heimholende kommen des herrn von gr ter bedeutung f r jeden neuapostolischen christen sei und sein glaubensziel bleibe
7257861 ich glaube dass vor allem gottes knechte d h die amtstr ger anm gk lernen m ssen anspruchsvolle gottesdienste zu halten mit interessantem inhalt mit mehr substanz
7257862 da ich bisher vor allem ber die ausstiegsberatung kontakt mit ehemaligen mitgliedern der nak hatte nahm ich dieses seminar zum anlass um mich einmal umfassend mit dieser religionsgemeinschaft zu befassen und meine bisher sehr einseitige perspektive zu erweitern
7257863 daher wollte ich in meiner magisterarbeit zum einen die ver nderungen dokumentieren um eben diesen mangel zu beheben und zum anderen die ursachen f r diese ver nderungen ermitteln
7257864 wenn man das bisherige geschehen betrachtet so wird deutlich dass es in vielen bereichen bewegung gibt und die ver nderungsprozesse anhalten
7257865 geradezu der eindruck die kirchenleitung versuche zu vermeiden sich auf bestimmte aussagen festzulegen
7257866 sowohl eine traditionelle konservative lesart wie eine progressive liberale lesart m glich
7257867 diese uneindeutigkeit steht im widerspruch zum eigenen anspruch die neuapostolische identit t f r jeden erkennbar und unverwechselbar pr sentieren zu wollen
7257868 de kerk is niet van de leber en sauer maar de kerk is van de broeders en zusters die elke zondag trouw in de kerkbanken zitten
7257869 en die paar duizend die nog in de kracht van hun leven zijn die weten het ook niet meer
7257870 hem aan te nemen als ware het jezus christus z lf die onder hen zal treden
7257871 welt am sontag maar mag ik nu kwaad zijn de kerk heeft veel van mensen hun leven gevraagd families zijn uit elkaar gevallen de consequentie dat oudere generaties mee moeten maken dat hun kinderen en kleinkinderen met rancuneuze gevoelend de kerk hebben verlaten zorgt voor veel verdriet
7257872 in tegenstelling tot jou nakker 12 vind ik het heel erg goed dat bauke opkomt voor al die mensen die ten gevolge van de boodschap van bischoff de kerk zijn uitgesmeten
7257873 misschien kunnen jullie hem ook even vertellen dat het mooi geweest is nu
7257874 akte van peter kuhlen en hij gebruikt dan de woorden ich hab es nicht gewusst tja dan zoiets zal het wel worden
7257875 denk je nou echt dat een dap van bv het missiegebied nederland waar altijd gedonder is iets in de melk te brokkelen heeft ik geloof er niets van
7257876 door mensen genomen is godslastering en heeft alles in zich om het volledig te verwerpen twijfel komt er niet eens aan te pas
7257877 nogmaals zeg ik op deze steen kunnen we bouwen op jezus christus
7257878 ja das stimmt kein negatives signal von oben wurde als ein positives signal gesehen
7257879 reinier dit log staat vol met verwijten aannames generalisaties en bijvoorkeur door weinigen over de ruggen van velen een persoonlijke geschiedenis wordt door de gemiddelde deelnemer hier gespiegeld op de gehele geloofsgemeenschap en met gemak onderbouwd met uiteenlopende voorbeelden van pesoonlijk leed hierbij wordt structureel voorbij gegaan aan de eigen rol in de tijd dat men zelf actief was ja ik beweer een zeer goede neus te hebben voor het verschil tussen broeders en zusters die hun taak of ambt vanuit een dienende overtuiging uitoefenen en zij die zich zelf graag zien en horen ik ervaar de laatste tijd op dit gebied een lautering
7257880 radicale verlichting van jonathan i israel hoe radicale nederlandse denkers het gezicht van onze cultuur voorgoed veranderden
7257881 vanmiddag schreef ik nog aan iemand hoe ik bezig ben met een
7257882 radicale verlichting van jonathan i israel hoe radicale nederlandse denkers het gezicht van onze cultuur voorgoed veranderden
7257883 want de flagrante nalatigheid om in het onderwijs of voor het nationale bewustzijn ook maar iets te doen aan bayle die net als spinoza en descartes in nederlande leefde en werkte en net als hen in het rijtje grote filosofen thuishoort is een typisch symptoom van de huidige malaise die de nederlandse samenleving tart er heerst grote onkunde om de werkelike historische en filosofische betekenis van noties als tolerantie vrijheid van meningsuiting en persoonlijke vrijheid te waarderen en te ontsluiten
7257884 het is niet mogelijk om via een andere weg dan deze tot het koninkrijk gods te komen
7257885 ik zal niet sterven de heer komt tijdens mijn leven
7257886 al het navolgen dient gericht te zijn op jezus christus
7257887 ik blijf bij de naakte feiten en draai er niet omheen
7257888 als je belooft dat het antwoord onder ons blijft geef ik je een uittreksel van de brief die leber mij heeft gezonden
7257889 het is een feit dat een koe meer schijt dan een geit had de geit dat geweten dan had hij zeker meer gescheten
7257890 al het navolgen dient gericht te zijn op jezus christus
7257891 nach fast f nfeinhalb jahrzehnten hat sich die leitung der neuapostolischen kirche f r die ausschl sse von mehr als 1
7257892 ik verontschuldig me als vanwege ons gedrag en de toenmalige excommunicaties er geestelijke verwondingen en zielenleed zijn ontstaan
7257893 nak moet excuses aanbieden maar zal dat nooit doen vanwege te verwachten claims
7257894 nak nl is oorzaak van ontbreken dialoog tussen nak en gvac
7257895 de move destijds om de boodschap na jgbs dood te blijven verklaren als goddelijk was fout maar in mijn ogen ook een paniekreactie van de nieuwe leiding die puin mocht ruimen en met hun denkraam en overlevingsdrang geen andere verklaring kon bedenken ik geloof pertinent niet dat het een strategische keuze was maar veel meer een logische reactie immers het kon niet anders binnen het nakdenkraam van toen
7257896 ik ben geboren om te moeten vechten en strijden tegen machten en duivelen daarom zijn mijn boeken vaak heftig en fel ik moet bonken en stenen uitroeien doornen en hagen afhakken kuilen opvullen vrije baan maken en de grond toebereiden maar filippus melanchton een vriend van luhter deze aanvulling is van bauke gaat keurig en stil zijn gang bouwt en plant zaait en begiet met lust al naar mate god hem rijkelijk zijn gaven heeft gegeven zo ik ergens tekort schiet heb ik liever dat ik te hard spreek maar mij houd aan de goddelijke waarheid
7257897 in die tijd was er nog nauwelijks televisie anders was het toen al afgelopen geweest
7257898 zij die niet geloven in de goddelijke inhoud van de bizarre gebeurtenis lees de boodschap van bisschoff worden anno 2006 uitgemaakt voor ongelovigen
7257899 jack 07 april 2006 13 45 je kunt dat mensen ook nauwelijks kwalijk nemen in de politiek zie je hetzelfde mensen zijn zelfs bereid om een deel van hun salaris in te leveren om maar macht en aanzien te hebben der wille zur macht maar kom er dan ook gewoon eerlijk voor uit dat praat wat makkelijker
7257900 als ik het goede wil doen is het kwade mij alweer nabij
7257901 de duivel staat te springen van plezier op zijn troon
7257902 we gaan over niet al te lange tijd verhuizen naar wildervank dus als ik nog steeds welkom ben en als het mag van br scharlaken kom ik graag een keer bij jullie in de gemeenschap langs
7257903 beste broeder kom vaker want dan wordt u mischien gelouterd en het is nog genadetijd
7257904 neemt niet weg dat ik het er nog steeds voor over heb omdat ik geloof dat we iets moois in handen hebben ik krijg alleen de indruk dat we vaak nog op zoek zijn naar de mooiste kant van de diamant en niet weten hoe we hem vast moeten houden om ervan te kunnen genieten
7257905 beste rob bedankt voor je bericht voor mij was direct al duidelijk dat je niet de schrijver was van het gewraakte bericht sommigen menen de vrijheid van meningsuiting te mogen gebruiken om anderen willens en wetens te krenken het siert een lid van de z g bruidsgemeente geenszins het is een vorm van domheid die het gevolg van de uitwerking van de exclusiviteitsgedachten zulke lieden bevestigen alleen maar mijn stellingen inzake de problematieken in en ronde de nak ronduit tragisch
7257906 waar vinden we de antichrist we vinden hem onder de leden van het zangkoor
7257907 wobei das taufverstaendnis der neuapostolischen kirche ein grundlegend anderes ist als in den anderen grossen christlichen kirchen
7257908 ik heb vernomen dat de opmerking van leber dat alleen de apostelen de bruid kunnen toebereiden voor de dag der eerste opstanding in bepaalde gemeenschappen zeer nadrukkelijk en vaak wordt geciteerd
7257909 nico het wat mijn moeder die mij gisteren vertelde dat genoemde visie van leber erg veel geciteerd werd
7257910 persoonlijk heb ik niet het idee dat een paar welwillende nederlandse nak leden enige invloed kunnen uitoefenen op de internationale kerkleiding
7257911 die hl versiegelung erf hrt keine ver nderung nach wie vor ist es eine aufgabe des apostelamtes und es pr gt entscheidend das profil unserer kirche dieses sakrament wird einzig durch das apostelamt gespendet es ist unabdingbare voraussetzung um zur brautgemeinde christi zu z hlen
7257912 das apostelamt ist heilsnotwendig aber mit der einschr nkung zur bereitung der brautgemeinde
7257913 indien er ooit eens een universele religie ontstaat zal die zich niet kenmerken door iets nieuws te prediken maar door alle overbodige ballast weg te doen en door terug te gaan naar het oorspronkelijke geloof
7257914 zomaar een dak boven wat hoofden deur die naar stilte openstaat muren van huid ramen als ogen speurend naar hoop en dageraad huis dat een levend lichaam wordt als wij er binnengaan om recht voor god te staan woorden van ver vallende sterren vonken verleden hier gezaaid namen voor hem dromen signalen diep uit de wereld aangewaaid monden van aarde horen en zien onthouden spreken voort gods vrij en lichtend woord tafel van een brood om te weten dat wij elkaar gegeven zijn wonder van god mensen in vrede oud en vergeten nieuw geheim breken en delen zijn wat niet kan doen wat ondenkbaar is dood en verrijzenis
7257915 de boom wordt hoe langer hoe dikker de boom die vrede heet een boom die bloeit in elk seizoen god kiest ons uit om mee te doen de boom wordt hoe langer hoe dikker de boom die vrede heet de boom wordt hoe langer hoe dikker de boom die vrede heet hij groeit door hem door jou en mij dus geef je hand je kom er bij de boom wordt hoe langer hoe dikker de boom die vrede heet de boom wordt hoe langer hoe dikker de boom die vrede heet al zeggen mensen ach die boom die is er niet het is een droom de boom wordt hoe langer hoe dikker de boom die vrede heet
7257916 als een boom ben je wortelend waar water stroomt vol van vrucht en blad dan niet zal dorren geluk wacht jou als je niet opgaat in de waan van de dag op de weg van wie kapot maakt geen voet zet niet zit in de kring van de spotters geluk wacht jou als je geniet van de weg die de eeuwige wijst en die beproeft bij dag en bij nacht tot ontplooiing komt wat je doet vernietigers zal het vergaan als kaf wind waait hen weg niet zullen zij bestaan in het gericht wie kapot maakt raakt verloren
7257917 als een boom ben je wortelend waar water stroomt vol van vrucht en blad dan niet zal dorren
7257918 toen christus ons vrijmaakte wilde hij dat wij vrij zouden blijven
7257919 het lijkt soms wel alsof alles daar gedurig om moet draaien
7257920 nun ist es unbestritten dass die stammapostel der vergangenheit manche positiven und richtigen entscheidungen verk ndigt haben aber die frage bleibt
7257921 da gott jedem menschen seinen freien willen gegeben hat haben die apostel und ich keine macht oder befugnis zu bestimmen ob frauen oder m dchen ihre haare kurz oder lang tragen oder sich die lippen und fingern gel f rben d rfen wir haben auch kein recht dar ber zu bestimmen ob sich jemand einen radio oder fernsehapparat oder hnliches zulegen darf es muss auch jedem berlassen bleiben ob er rauchen will und welche nahrungs oder lebensmittel er genie en und welche getr nke er in form von wein bier cognac weinbrand schnaps whiskey oder alkoholfreie fl ssigkeit zu sich nehmen will ferner k nnen wir keine vorschriften machen ber den kauf von gebrauchsgegenst nden des menschlichen lebens bei allem was wir erwerben kommt es auf das bed rfnis an was mir nicht zum leiblichen und seelischen wohl sowie dazu dient das verh ltnis zu gott noch inniger zu gestalten verwende ich nicht
7257922 was mir nicht dazu dient in meinem glauben vorw rts zu kommen verwende ich nicht
7257923 en ik wil ook nog een keer herhalen dat ik niet het gevoel heb dat
7257924 ook de volgorde van afdracht h g en doop is bijzonder
7257925 misschien is dit de nieuwe bijbelvertaling waardoor het er net anders staat
7257926 weet iemand nog welke uitleg dat is want je moet wel behoorlijk goed kunnen goochelen om een dergelijke draai aan dit verhaal te kunnen geven
7257927 en toen simon zag dat door de oplegging van de handen der apostelen de heilige geest gegeven werd bood hij hun geld aan
7257928 hoe denk je bv over de excluviteitsgedachte van de nak
7257929 ik ben getrouwd met het meisje dat ik het liefste wou n et met de kerk
7257930 over de noodzakelijkheid over de afdracht van de heilige geest door een apostel
7257931 over het idee dat nakers denken later als koningen en priesters werkzaam te zullen zijn
7257932 over het feit dat gerrit sepers de kerk heeft verlaten
7257933 ik luisterde deze week naar de cd van doe maar klaar
7257934 maar of het geholpen heeft dat weet ik eerlijk gezegd niet
7257935 ik las laatst ook nog een verhaal over opziener lakerveld dit naar aanleding van het bezoek van de beatles aan nederland
7257936 sommige mensen denken dat ze bijzonder en origineel zijn zo verschrikkelijk anders dan anderen en dat hun uniciteit een geschenk is van de lieve god of een beloning voor hun harde werken dat zijn praatjes voor domoren
7257937 sindsdien kozen wij voor normaal dan deed je al gek genoeg
7257938 even voor alle duidelijkheid de evangelist die ik bedoelde in mijn 21 20 posting is niet dezelfde als degene die vage gast aanhaalde in zijn 17 54 posting
7257939 wir m ssen eben noch ein wenig geduld haben und das muss man ja immer denn dann erst empf ngt man den grossen segen
7257940 zonder een moreel oordeel te willen vellen zij leggen anderen lasten op die ze zelf niet kunnen dragen
7257941 ik vraag haar ten huwelijk en wanneer zij dan ja heeft gezegd je weet wel wanneer iemand vraagt wilt u met hem trouwen en daarna aan mij dan roep k h l hard n ha ha ha ha
7257942 van je aanbidder kom in de eerste en in de tweede pauze naar het bos bij de glijbaan daar wacht ik op je
7257943 joh maak dan tw brieven ook eentje aan een jongen uit jouw klas dan is het pas lachen wanneer ze elkaar bij de glijbaan treffen
7257944 het zijn wel lange stille dagen hoor ik zie mijn kinderen maar weinig ze hebben allemaal een druk leven en al dat huiswerk ook tegenwoordig op de scholen
7257945 nou gistermiddag was mijn kleindochter nog hier en zaterdag ga ik met mijn zoon
7257946 draag elkaars lasten zo leeft u de wet van christus na
7257947 jack misschien plaatsen we straks wel spotprenten van bm in deense kranten maar het hele demoniseren waar hij mee bezig is keur ik ten zeerste af ik heb echt mijn best gedaan om deze man beter te leren kennen beter te leren begrijpen maar je komt niet verder dan een schuimbekkende huilende tierende schreeuwende vloekende man daarom zal elke psycholoog het met me eens zijn dat die man echt hulp nodig heeft en in een inrichting thuis hoort
7257948 vage gast jammer dat mijn amersfoortse broeder zo lang van stof is het maakt het lezen er niet makkelijker op moet ik zeggen
7257949 bauke webteam herman van der hoeven en alle anderen wat ben ik geschrokken van alle commotie
7257950 maar je bericht is ook een beetje dom vanwege je laatste afkorting die je wel eens vaker gebruikt nietwaar
7257951 ga ook even naar een lagere demensie want bellen met bauke is ook een vorm van oorlog voeren en dat deed timothy ook
7257952 timothy is een van de namen gebruikt door een en dezelfde deelnemer die steeds opnieuw een ip adres kan aanmaken
7257953 de persoon of enkelen kunnen deze strategie kiezen voor de goede of
7257954 het gaat hier over de zaak die geloof heet en dan moet je de onoorbare praktijken niet toepassen en eerlijk proberen te zijn
7257955 timothy is een van de namen gebruikt door een en dezelfde deelnemer die steeds opnieuw een ip adres kan aanmaken
7257956 met zijn frustratie met esther banning heb ik niets van doen en dus moet hij me er ook niet mee in verband brengen hetgeen hij hierboven om 15 19u in ieder geval doet door de ellende nb dit topic begint met een schrijven van gjs aan mij gericht en gaat over de genoemde ellende
7257957 tjerk als je iets wilt uitpraten met me doe dat rechtstreeks je kent mn andere voorwaarde aub een dialoog en geen monoloog
7257958 tot dat iemand hier zou gaan insinueren dat u dezelfde bent als vage gast die dezelfde is als tjerk b
7257959 wat wil god nu werkelijk met mij wat wil hij werkelijk van mij
7257960 ik ben af en toe een hypocriet een godenmannetje d
7257961 wie mijn hand vasthoudt die breng ik aan het doel
7257962 p s ik had geen tijd om deze brief in te korten
7257963 heer wanneer hebben wij u hongerig gezien en te eten gegeven of dorstig en u te drinken gegeven 38 wanneer hebben wij u als vreemdeling gezien en opgenomen u naakt gezien en gekleed 39 wanneer hebben wij gezien dat u ziek was of in de gevangenis zat en zijn we naar u toe gekomen
7257964 ik verzeker jullie alles wat jullie gedaan hebben voor een van de onaanzienlijksten van mijn broeders of zusters dat hebben jullie voor mij gedaan
7257965 het gaat om het doden van goddelijk leven in enkele van uw naasten
7257966 drie van mijn kinderen werden daarvan het slachtoffer bij de een werd het kinderlijke vertrouwen uit handen geslagen de ander verloor zijn onbevangenheid en de derde miste sindsdien in het leven de glans in de ogen
7257967 maar de uitspraak in deze zaak hangt niet alleen d rvan af u heeft een prachtig talent in mijn dienst gesteld
7257968 echter ieder lid is even belangrijk voor het lichaam zoals paulus laat zien in romeinen 12 en 1 corinthi rs 12
7257969 wanneer n lichaamsdeel pijn lijdt lijden alle andere mee wanneer n lichaamsdeel met respect behandeld wordt delen alle andere in die vreugde
7257970 wellicht hebben ze het op alle niveaus gelezen en besproken en worden de resultaten snel zichtbaar
7257971 verzoening als je deze onderwerpen op een theologische manier verdiept blijf je ook weg van de eeuwigdurende discussies over exclusiviteit en afdracht van de heilige geest en dergelijke want dan wordt geloven in een veel breder weidser perspectief gezet
7257972 voorzitter aram 1 van de wereldraad van kerken heeft in zijn openings rede van de assemblee in de braziliaanse stad porto alegre opgeroepen tot hervormingen van de versteende organisaties
7257973 moeten we er niet wat aan doen dat deze dominee zo maar denkt dat hij de heilige geest bezit arme dominee
7257974 waar ik mij weer over verbaas waarom geen nederlandse uitgave is de oplage dan is te klein
7257975 dan hebben wij het boekje vragen en antwoorden in de nederlandse taal niet nodig
7257976 maar begrijp jij waarom kerkelijke instituten er statuten op na houden belijdenissen en dergelijke
7257977 ik denk dat we het beter anders kunnen afspreken zodra we wat we gisteren lazen in de praktijk kunnen brengen lezen we verder
7257978 het is sinds jaar en dag zo dat dingen allereerst in de
7257979 relax mensen en dreig niet iedere keer het forum te verlaten dit is meende ik al de derde keer voor jullie beiden wat heeft het voor nut wat is nou de reden om te stoppen
7257980 er worden een aantal sprachen genoemd maar ik neem aan dat er vast ook wel een nederlandse komt dit lijkt me nu een vraag die je het beste kan stellen aan de nieuwe nak woordvoerder
7257981 ik vind het goed en dapper als een kerk standpunten durft te heroverwegen
7257982 door een krachtig bewustzijn van de vergankelijkheid van alle menselijke bedrijvigheid en roem
7257983 waarom je dan zoooo ontzettend druk maken als er een nieuw onvertaald boekje komt ik vind het echt verspilling van geloofs energie
7257984 die laatste zin heb ik ook weleens om mijn oren geslingerd gekregen door b m te g
7257985 als je ziek wordt van het oeverloze debat dan hou je er toch mee op
7257986 als er staat dat de heilige geest regeert in onze kerk dan vind ik dat een uitstekend uitgangspunt
7257987 ik denk misschien te simpel maar uiteindelijk is geloof misschien wel het meest persoonlijke wat er is
7257988 en ik bedoel je wilt toch ook niet dat de kerk een democratie wordt ofso
7257989 als het aan mij ligt kan men niet simpel genoeg geloven
7257990 2 debora ik weet zelf zo onderhand niet meer wat mijn mening is of hoe mijn gedachten zijn daarom hou ik me de laatste tijd wat op de vlakte
7257991 als je nou gewoon als uitgangspunt neemt ook binnen onze kerk
7257992 als je nou gewoon als uitgangspunt neemt ook binnen onze kerk
7257993 wat ik ook niet snap is het aanhoudende dreigen met vertrekken om vervolgens desnoods op dezelfde dag weer als of er niets aan de hand is verder te gaan waarom doen mensen dat
7257994 als onze kerk daadwerkelijk d r de heilige geest zou worden geregeerd was al dat onderzoek vanzelf niet nodig geweest dat is nu juist de crux
7257995 wat ik ook niet snap is het aanhoudende dreigen met vertrekken om vervolgens desnoods op dezelfde dag weer als of er niets aan de hand is verder te gaan waarom doen mensen dat
7257996 wees gelukkig dat ik niet met dezelfde soort modder ga teruggooien mbt zaken die jij beter zou kunnen doen enz
7257997 want nogmaals ik herken bijvoorbeeld het door jou zo vaak geschetste beeld van
7257998 ma sep 26 2005 2 19 pm lijkt me nogal gedateerd tjerk
7257999 beste nico doe me een plezier en bemoei je even alleen met je eigen zaken
7258000 nico mantel jou idee spreekt me erg aan ik vind het best
7258001 volgens mij hebben jullie vanmiddag laten zien wat de nachtmerrie van een schrijver op het forum is iemand aanvallen op dingen die lang terug geschreven zijn en uit zijn context gehaald zijn
7258002 okee ik zie je woensdagavond ben benieuwd of je opponent er ook is
7258003 niet het vele is goed doch het goede is zo veel
7258004 nb als je mijn reacties op jouw acteren vervelend vindt lok me dan ook niet steeds uit de tent door mijn initialen te vermelden bij de andere conflicten die je hebt
7258005 natuurlijk zal ook straks weer blijken dat er gewoon een nederlandse vertaling komt net als dat er geen ruk naar rechts komt
7258006 zodra je zelf laat zien het allemaal beter te kunnen
7258007 rob clijnk 20 februari 2006 14 57 ben jij diegene die zaterdagavond naar ik later begreep met een royale boog om mij heenliep
7258008 zou jij je niet eens wat anders moeten afvragen in de baas zijn tijd
7258009 mijn reactie dat ik ziek thuis zat werd niet meer op gereageerd
7258010 om het betoog een ambachtelijke uitstraling mee te geven laat ik wel eens opzettelijk een paar taalfouten staan
7258011 om te 14 47 uur een snederende opmerking te plaatsen
7258012 om te 14 57 uur een snerende opmerking te plaatsen
7258013 en die flauwe streek naderhand van nico mantel met zn fototoestel om 19 58 uur dat sloeg werkelijk alles nico wil je even aan de leiding doorgeven dat je voortaan voor mij mag invallen maar zorg er voor de zekerheid wel voor dat je bij dag en bij nacht je cameraatje bij de hand hebt
7258014 zo heb ik wel een hele poos gedacht maar heb nu een ander inzicht
7258015 nico mantel jou idee spreekt me erg aan ik vind het best
7258016 ik bedoel toen hij tegenover anderen in de tempel duidelijk zei waar het die keer op stond
7258017 trek je eigen plan je laat een rob of nico of wie dan ook toch niet bepalen of je naar de kerk gaat of niet
7258018 ge nteresseerden zullen heus wel opzoeken in nbv het spaart jezelf veel copy paste acties uit
7258019 in mijn praktijk komen mensen die met hun emoties in de knel zitten
7258020 vergeven en vertrouwen zijn twee begrippen die vaak met elkaar worden verward wanneer iemand je meerdere malen heeft bedrogen kun je deze persoon vergeven hebben terwijl je hem nog niet vertrouwt weten dat iemand je vaak heeft bedrogen is te vergelijken met weten dat van een bepaalde stoel n poot niet deugt als je weet dat een stoel niet stevig is kun je er beter niet op gaan zitten
7258021 stond er onbegrensd vertrouwen ach dat moet je anders zien
7258022 ik wil niet zeggen dat boosheid nooit nut heeft maar je wil toch niet zeggen dat wat er gister gebeurde erg constructief was
7258023 je kijkt elkaar wel voor de kop maar niet in de krop
7258024 men zal moeten merken dat men enoooooorme fouten maakt en dat dit dramaaaaaatsche gevolgen heeft
7258025 ik vermoed dat betrokkene vooraan in de kerk zijn haar plaats inneemt
7258026 m helemaal niet maar dat hoef ik niet te pikken ik schrijf nog n stukje en dan de groeten met het hele log deborah bekijk het van de grappige kant en je zult zien dat het dan veel minder erg is allemaal het is inderdaad een spel van meningen en ook hier en daar het uittesten van elkaar
7258027 het gevoel kan krijgen dat men door iets van buitenaf bijzonder is geworden en dat dit niet ondersteund wordt door intrinsieke waarden
7258028 een ander net zo lief te hebben als jezelf als je gelijktijdig volhoudt dat jij wel de heilige geest bezit bv en de ander niet zijn dit naar mijn idee inhoudsloze woorden en daarmee zijn ze betekenisloos
7258029 zo gij heet waart of koud maar nu gij lauw zijt geworden
7258030 een ander net zo lief te hebben als jezelf als je gelijktijdig volhoudt dat jij wel de heilige geest bezit bv en de ander niet zijn dit naar mijn idee inhoudsloze woorden en daarmee zijn ze betekenisloos
7258031 basil ik vind het jammer dat u concludeert dat de discussie die wij voeren zinloos is temeer omdat ik argumenten aanvoer die mijn idee ondersteunen ook gerrit sepers voert in zijn tekst belangrijke argumenten aan en ik was juist zo benieuwd waarom u deze argumenten als onjuist typeert
7258032 stel je geluk niet afhankelijk van anderen jij bent helemaal zelf verantwoordelijk voor je eigen geluk de enige die je in deze wereld kan veranderen is jezelf ik wens je oprecht het beste kerel
7258033 stel je geluk niet afhankelijk van anderen je bent helemaal zelf verantwoordelijk voor je eigen geluk
7258034 en let op als je het antwoord schuldig blijft wil ik als genoegdoening een reep chocola van mijn favoriete merk
7258035 de enige op deze wereld die jezelf kan veranderen ben je zelf
7258036 het wordt gewoon eens tijd om uit de slachtofferrol te stappen je ongeluk niet alleen aan anderen toe te schrijven en jezelf eens bij elkaar te rapen het is gewoon heel lastig communiceren met personen die altijd alles wat je zegt negatief weten uit te leggen
7258037 hoe geplaagd u ook kunt zijn door het leven vergeet niet te l ven tel ook eens de zonnige uren soit punt uit
7258038 bukowski hoedt u voor hen die vrede prediken zij zoeken vrede
7258039 luid huilen je verdriet uitschreeuwen stiekem vinden we dat ongepast je verdriet houd je voor je als je het al publiek maakt dan het liefst in een stille tocht de ironie is dat we zo een vergelijkbaar afwerende houding jegens nabestaanden innemen als dutchbat in de enclave jegens de belegerden
7258040 zonder voelen leerden ze nooit wat de dommen de onverschilligen de anderen
7258041 ik had eens zon collegaatje die ook zo somber de wereld inkeek
7258042 kop op zuster god heeft het beste met u voor en enkel gedachten van vrede over u
7258043 mooi apostolisch gesproken jongen morgen mag je het z lf eens proberen
7258044 je bent maar n keer slachtoffer daarna ben je vrijwilliger
7258045 nou ja wellicht zijn gods bedoelingen goed maar pakt zijn lesmethode niet echt altijd echt handig voor iedereen uit
7258046 en had hij daar beter een lantaarnpaal of zo neer kunnen zetten
7258047 lucifer was toch een afvallige engel en werd daardoor een bengel maar dat betekent dat ook engelen een vrije wil hebben maar dan nog is lucifer niet het begin van het kwaad want het kwaad zat dan al in deze engel en in de schepping verweven
7258048 waarom de vrouw van lot veranderen in een zoutpilaar omdat ze uit eigen vrije wil nog n keer omkeek
7258049 maar ik heb wel de indruk dat veel ambtsbroeders onder vier ogen andere dingen zeggen dan bv in diensten volgens mij is het in de cultuur van de nak uiterst belangrijk om in de gunst te blijven van hogere ambtsdragers
7258050 toen ik 18 jaar was had ik op een gegeven moment verkering met mijn huidige partner overigens en toen moesten wij op een zaterdagochtend bij distr ev blink komen
7258051 het onterechte in hoe ik mijn mening deel met jack
7258052 ihr lieben es k nnte die frage kommen wenn es geschwister gibt die eine abweichende haltung haben k nnen die
7258053 selbstverst ndlich selbstverst ndlich k nnen auch solche die eine abweichende haltung haben in unserer kirche bleiben jeder ist uns willkommen jeder darf hier seine geistige heimat haben wir dr ngen niemanden hinaus
7258054 de god die aan de scepsis voorafgaat is een heel andere god dan die welke zich na de scepsis vertoont
7258055 het is niet simpelweg het volgend van die regeltjes nee het is een waarheid waar je naar op zoek moet gaan en die als het goed is steeds duiderlijker wordt
7258056 wat hebben we toch een fijn werk broeders en zusters
7258057 vindt jij nog steeds dat de nak het ware geloof overheerst
7258058 ik voel me of ik ben een kind van god
7258059 en is dat dan iets wat je zelf ontdekt of zijn het slechts de apostelen die de geheimenissen gods openbaren en door wie de hg werkt
7258060 het is niet simpelweg het volgend van die regeltjes nee het is een waarheid waar je naar op zoek moet gaan en die als het goed is steeds duiderlijker wordt
7258061 gij zult liefhebben de heer uw god met geheel uw hart en met geheel uw ziel en met geheel uw verstand
7258062 het moge duidelijk zijn dat de geschiedenis van met name dit log ons heeft geleerd vooral niet met al t veel persoonlijke gegevens te opereren
7258063 de verhalen die men over jou vertelde voor de ombouw naar een anti nakker liegen er in ieder geval niet om
7258064 zijt ge apostolisch naar de naam slechts of apostolisch met den daad
7258065 m helemaal niet maar dat hoef ik niet te pikken ik schrijf nog n stukje en dan de groeten met het hele log het is inderdaad een spel van meningen en ook hier en daar het uittesten van elkaar maar hou het genuanceerd
7258066 de verwarming moet op 20 c nee vindt de ander hij moet op 19 c het orgel speelt te hard die die kan niet dirigeren enz
7258067 grote geest wiens stem ik in de wind herken en wiens adem de wereld leven brengt hoor mij aan ik treed voor uw aangezicht als een uwer vele kinderen ik ben klein en zwak ik heb uw kracht en wijsheid nodig laat mij in schoonheid rondzwerven en mijn ogen steeds de purperrode zonsondergang aanschouwen mogen mijn handen de dingen eren die u geschapen heeft en mijn oren uw stem horen maak mij wijs opdat ik de dingen begrijpen kan die u mijn volk geleerd heeft de kennis welke u in ieder blad en iedere rots verborgen heeft ik verlang naar kracht niet om mijn broeders de baas te zijn doch om mijn grootste tegenstander mijn ik te kunnen bestrijden maak dat ik altijd klaar sta om met reine handen en oprechte ogen u tegemoet te treden opdat mijn geest wanneer het leven als de ondergaande zon verdwijnt tot u kan komen zonder zich te hoeven schamen
7258068 nakker 12 een christen is niet iemand die elke zondagmorgen en woensdagavond en maandagavond in een kerkje zit in een kerkgebouwtje in het districht assen of elders
7258069 ik zal er zijn zonsopgang nieuw verbond dat hoge woord geschreven wit op zwart trouw van trouw hoe heeft het ons bvrijd beschaamd vervoerd getroost dan weer getart hoe dorsten wij te weten wie gij zijt
7258070 ik kan mij herinneren dat er van de bijbel werd gesproken als de bijbel is een dood woord als hooi en stro gelijk maar het woord wat hier wordt gesproken is het echte levende woord gods
7258071 levend water i p v stilstaand putwater moeten de schapen krijgen
7258072 in het verleden door dienaren met de beste bedoelingen toch veel fouten zijn gemaakt
7258073 als de heer wederkomt tijdens de middagdienst en jij zit in het voetbalstadion of in de bioscoop dan ga je niet mee
7258074 wie oren heeft moet horen wat de geest tegen de gemeenten zegt
7258075 dit zegt amen de trouwe en betrouwbare getuige het begin van gods schepping 15 ik weet wat u doet hoe u niet koud bent en niet warm
7258076 und gott segnete sie und sprach zu ihnen seid fruchtbar und mehret euch
7258077 und gott der herr sprach es ist nicht gut dass der mensch allein sei ich will ihm eine gehilfin machen die um ihn sei
7258078 darum wird ein mann seinen vater und seine mutter verlassen und seiner frau anhangen und sie werden sein ein fleisch
7258079 er aber antwortete und sprach habt ihr nicht gelesen der im anfang den menschen geschaffen hat schuf sie als mann und frau und sprach 1 mose 2 24 darum wird ein mann vater und mutter verlassen und an seiner frau h ngen und die zwei werden ein fleisch sein
7258080 darum wird ein mann vater und mutter verlassen und an seiner frau h ngen und die zwei werden ein fleisch sein 1 mose 2 24
7258081 denn es ist kein ansehen der person vor gott alle die ohne gesetz ges ndigt haben werden
7258082 darin be ich mich allezeit ein unverletztes gewissen zu haben vor gott und den menschen
7258083 kommt her zu mir alle die ihr m hselig und beladen seid ich will euch erquicken
7258084 habt ihr nicht gelesen im gesetz wie die priester am sabbat im tempel den sabbat brechen also durch bertretung des 3 gebotes s ndigen und sind doch ohne schuld
7258085 du sollst nicht ehebrechen du sollst nicht begehren deines n chsten haus du sollst nicht begehren deines n chsten frau knecht magd rund esel noch alles was dein n chster hat
7258086 und ihr habt geh rt dass gesagt ist 2 mose 20 14 du sollst nicht ehebrechen ich aber sage euch wer eine frau ansieht sie zu begehren der hat schon mit ihr die ehe gebrochen in seinem herzen
7258087 ik wil de sprekende zijn in de ure dat gij spreken zult
7258088 de genade van onze heer en heiland jezus christus de liefde van god onze vader en de troostrijke gemeenschap van de heilige geest zij en blijven met u amen
7258089 dat gij niet onware troost vat naast ware troost uit ontvangtenissen des zegens
7258090 maar ik heb tegen u dat gij uw eerste liefde verzaakt hebt gedenk dan van welke hoogte gij gevallen zijt en bekeer u en doe weder uw eerste werken maar zo niet dan kom ik tot u en ik zal uw kandelaar van zijn plaats wegnemen indien gij u niet bekeert
7258091 niet een ieder die tot mij zegt here here zal het koninkrijk der hemelen binnengaan maar wie doet de wil mijns vader die in de hemelen is velen zullen te dien dage tot mij zeggen here here hebben wij niet uw naam velen krachten gedaan en dan zal ik hun openlijk zeggen ik heb u nooit gekend gaat weg van mij werkers der wetteloosheid
7258092 geloof diegenen die de waarheid zoeken en twijfel aan diegenen die van mening zijn deze reeds gevonden te hebben
7258093 heerlijk om zo een fijne discussie te lezen over hoe het vroeger was mooi ook dat er op respectvolle wijze met elkaar wordt omgegaan eindelijk
7258094 andere deelnemers op dit web log respectloos behandelen c q afbranden
7258095 wijze mannen moeten zich niet beroemen op hun wijsheid sterke mannen niet op hun kracht en rijken niet op hun rijkdom
7258096 meneer u kent me niet maar ik ben de soldaat voor wie uw zoon zijn leven heeft gegeven
7258097 het is misschien niet veel ik ben niet zon groot kunstenaar maar ik denk dat uw zoon zou willen dat ik het aan u gaf
7258098 o nee meneer ik kan nooit terugbetalen wat uw zoon voor mij heeft gedaan ik schenk het u
7258099 we starten met bieden op het schilderij van de zoon wie biedt er op dit schilderij
7258100 wil iemand hierop bieden wie start er met 100 200
7258101 hier zijn we niet voor gekomen we willen de van goghs en de rembrandts zien laten we met de echte veiling beginnen
7258102 geef het hem maar voor die 10 laat ons de meesterwerken zien
7258103 het spijt me voor u allen maar de veiling is hiermede be indigd
7258104 het spijt me toen ik werd geraadpleegd om deze veiling te organiseren is mij meteen verteld dat er een geheime bepaling in het testament bestond deze geheime bepaling mocht ik niet eerder openbaar maken dan nu
7258105 ach henk de lieve god schud af en toe eens aan de boom en dan vallen de rotte appelen er vanzelf uit
7258106 we dienen toch te accepteren dat er mensen zijn die uiterst ingewikkelde zaken wel begrijpen en anderen niet
7258107 dus back to the sixties zou een uitermate slechte zaak zijn het programma voor de jeugdverzorging zorgt daar in ieder geval wel voor
7258108 officiele internationale literatuur voor de jeugdverzorging die conservatief zou zijn
7258109 nu wordt door sociologen sowieso al vaak gesteld dat voetbal langzamerhand de positie van religie overneemt maar de vergelijking is treffend wie niet voor ons is is tegen ons
7258110 dan consacreer ik het brood en de wijn wel zelf
7258111 het lied over de aarde wandelt een heilge schaar de edelen wie zijn zij het zijn de getrouwen van koning jezus
7258112 jij vindt klassieke muziek mooi ik niet even goeie vrienden
7258113 bemoeizucht en isolationisme zijn de twee polen waartussen de ik zwakke persoonlijkheid heen en weer zwalkt door zijn grenzeloosheid dringt hij voortdurend het domein van anderen binnen als die anderen zich daar tenslotte tegen verweren en hem de deur wijzen trekt hij zich mokkend terug in zijn eigen kamer vol verwijt over de onheuse behandeling die hem ten deel valt maar na een poosje vloeit hij weer als water onder de deur door naar buiten en dan begint het verhaal van de grenzeloze bemoeizucht weer van voren af aan tot hij opnieuw op grenzen stuit grenzen die altijd door anderen zullen moeten worden gemarkeerd
7258114 zou het niet veel beter zijn dat de kerk tot een dialoog komt en het verleden gaat opschonen bijvoorbeeld de boodschap van bischoff leg de verantwoordelijkheid bij de verantwoordelijken en beslist niet bij god
7258115 als je nu een staatslot koopt zul je de hoofdprijs winnen
7258116 al zit je met je mooie zwarte trui met rode strepen in het kinderkoor dat leidt alleen maar af van dat waar het om draait
7258117 als het me niet bevalt dan is het een behoorlijk eind naar beneden 6 hoog
7258118 ja nu maken ze zich er wel heel makkelijk van af
7258119 er is godsdienst die wil dat wij ons verstand inleveren ons denken uitschakelen en ons gehoorzaam en zonder vragen in de traditie voegen er is ook geloof dat voor geen vraag terugdeinst tegelijk wetend dat het laatste antwoord nooit kan worden gegeven omdat wij over geheimen spreken en omdat de eeuwige geprezen zij zijn naam boven het dak van ons denken woont
7258120 pas op dat je je gelijk niet boven je geluk stelt
7258121 in die zin ben ik een echte freudiaan ik geloof dat er onbehagen is in de cultuur en dat de beschaving een dun laagje is dat de driften nauwelijks in toom houdt
7258122 inhoudelijk wil ik nog wel vermelden dat het kunnen ontstaan van dit soort harde discussies wederzijds te maken heeft met het polariserende effect van dit weblog zonder gjs nu van alles de schuld te willen geven ligt de oorzaak hiervan naast het voor open discussies ongeschikte medium internet ook bij zijn keuze te blijven hameren op onderwerpen die voor het gevoel van de gemiddelde deelnemer en naar ik steeds meer hoor ook lezer reeds tot vervelens toe al besproken zijn juist dit leidt tot polarisatie er wordt ook niets nieuws gemeld om in gesprek te blijven worden de argumenten voor en tegen alleen nog maar stelliger gedeponeerd maar natuurlijk heeft gjs het recht om door te gaan en zn zegje te blijven herhalen zo ook zij die daar weer op reageren
7258123 huisvredebreuk dan moet je de deur van je huis maar niet open laten staan zet er een log op en je voorkomt het dat aononieme broeders en zusters hier schrijven kun je prachtige godsvrezende taal uitkramen over hoe geweldig je wel niet bent en toe maar de geest des heren spreekt er immers al over de valse apostel en profeten zie hier
7258124 we zijn wel op de wereld maar niet van de wereld
7258125 ik herken het gevaar van geknecht worden hier in nederland niet
7258126 jezus zou zich er over verbazen als hij zou weten dat hij tegenwoordig gezien wordt als de zoon van god
7258127 het hangt meer samen met de gedragingen van de leidinggevenden
7258128 de ervaring zal je moeten leren wie en wat je kunt geloven vertrouwen
7258129 het is heer uw werk en dat ging toen ook goed
7258130 hij gaf ons gevoelens zodat onze zinnen werden geprikkeld en vervolgens stelde hij regels in op grond waarvan we diezelfde gevoelens moesten negeren
7258131 verder heb je grappige overeenkomsten met een andere deelnemer hier die zelf altijd raadsels achter de anonimiteit probeert te doorgronden
7258132 dialoog betekent ook open staan voor wat een ander zegt
7258133 daarmee wil ik geen afbreuk doen aan het verhaal van thea
7258134 dialoog betekent ook open staan voor wat een ander zegt
7258135 ik heb nergens getracht recht te praten wat krom is en anders mag je me erop wijzen met citaten
7258136 hoort moede zielen die naar vrede smachten en verderop stond geloof ik staakt uw bange klachten god geeft u vertroosting
7258137 dan weet u ook eens hoe dat voelt en staan we weer gelijk
7258138 henk als ik je wat voorschrijf ben je er binnen twee weken vanaf als ik je niets voorschrijf duurt het ongeveer 14 dagen
7258139 nou dan is het misschien wel minder geworden trouwens ik heb zelf vijf heiligen aan de muur jezus de messias maria de moeder van god kurt cobain de lijdende mens en john lennon imagine en ook nog che chevara als revolutionair
7258140 de voorganger van de gemeente waar ik toe behoorde haalde in een dienst aan dat hij enige dagen daarvoor op huisbezoek was geweest en daar de foto van de apostel op de televisie had zien staan hij sprak daar zijn afschuw over uit
7258141 wat is er dan veranderd in al die jaren net niets
7258142 nog niet zo lang geleden heeft gerrit sepers opgemerkt dat ook de tweede generatie lijdt aan de dramatische gevolgen van de zogenaamde stamapostelboodschap onlangs is eduard bijland op 74 jarige leeftijd overleden donderdag 4 mei 2006 heb ik de ingetogen en plechtige crematieplechtigheid bijgewoond voor de duidelijkheid eduard bijland was de zoon van districtsoudste bijland district leeuwarden eduard bijland was muzikaal en artistiek zeer begaafd in zijn beroepsleven hij was docent in het voortgezet onderwijs kon hij deze talenten slechts beperkt aanwenden gedurende zijn pensioen heeft hij de schade gedeeltelijk kunnen inhalen eduard bijland was een zeer getalenteerd latinist tijdens eerdergenoemde plechtigheid wees haayo bijland de zoon van eduard erop dat de uit de vijftiger jaren van de vorige eeuw lees stamapostelboodschap zeer grote gevolgen had voor zijn vader eduard bijland raakte gebrouilleerd met zijn vader oudste bijland en niet alleen de vader zoon relatie leed hieronder maar had ook grote gevolgen voor de gezinssituatie van eduard bijland eduard en zijn kinderen leden onder de hierboven geschetste situatie eduard heeft inktzwarte tijden gekend perioden van neerslachtigheid en depressiviteit kwelden hem haayo bijland tweede generatie liet in zijn toespraak duidelijk merken dat deze toestand ook hem niet onberoerd heeft gelaten ik heb bewondering voor de wijze waarop de kinderen van eduard bijland hun dierbare en erudiete vader op een respectvolle wijze de laatste eer brachten
7258143 dit alles gaat mij veel te ver en ik kom nu zeker niet meer terug op dit weblog
7258144 ken je je niet een beetje inhouden uit respect voor de nabestaanden
7258145 want wij hebben niet te vechten tegen vlees en bloed maar tegen overheden en machten namelijk tegen de heren der wereld die in de duisternis dezer eeuw heersen tegen de boze geesten onder den hemel
7258146 11 doet aan de gehele wapenrusting gods opdat gij kunt staande blijven tegen de listige aanvallen des duivels
7258147 vage gast ja nu je het zegt het klopt dat er een tijdlang veel nadruk is gelegd op het ergeren of beter gezegd het niet ergeren dat brengt bij mij allerlei gedachten naar boven waar kwam dat idee vandaan was ergenis toen zon belangrijk item wie heeft dat bedacht erg grappig dat je dit punt noemt
7258148 wie mijn hand vasthoudt die breng ik aan het doel
7258149 wie mijn hand vasthoudt die breng ik aan het doel
7258150 wie mijn hand vasthoudt die breng ik aan het doel
7258151 het plegen van smaad zonder het bewijs te leveren der waarheid van het ten laste gelegde feit en tegen beter weten in
7258152 ik heb het persoonlijk ook diverse malen meegemaakt dat ik een reprimande kreeg omdat ik het niet volledig eens was met hetgeen een hogere ambtsbroeder vond en mij werd te verstaan gegeven dat dit niet was toegestaan en vervolgens werd er een klacht ingediend bij de distr voorganger
7258153 christelijke naastenliefde begrip geduld lankmoedigheid barmhartigheid en tolerantie was ver te zoeken bij oudste bijland toen het erop aankwam
7258154 het plegen van smaad zonder het bewijs te leveren der waarheid van het ten laste gelegde feit en tegen beter weten in
7258155 christelijke naastenliefde begrip geduld lankmoedigheid barmhartigheid en tolerantie was ver te zoeken bij oudste bijland toen het erop aankwam
7258156 het plegen van smaad zonder het bewijs te leveren der waarheid van het ten laste gelegde feit en tegen beter weten in
7258157 wind en zee doe zo ik het wil zwijg wees stil zwijg wees stil
7258158 christelijke naastenliefde begrip geduld lankmoedigheid barmhartigheid en tolerantie was ver te zoeken bij oudste bijland toen het erop aankwam
7258159 het plegen van smaad zonder het bewijs te leveren der waarheid van het ten laste gelegde feit en tegen beter weten in
7258160 het gebrek aan respect ontstaat als je vergeet dat je een deel van het geheel bent
7258161 want in zijn zoon heeft god u een plaats der ontkoming bereid
7258162 kind geloof toch elke dag hoe de storm ook woeden mag
7258163 als ik d t had geweten ja dan had ik daar vanzelf rekening mee willen houden
7258164 ik denk dat een aantal deelnemers het te druk heeft met boos reageren op wat de ander zegt dan dat ze werkelijk geinteresseerd zijn in wat de ander denkt
7258165 degenen die nog nooit zoiets als een trauma hebben opgelopen hebben niet het recht om zo te oordelen
7258166 godsdienst heeft een systeemdrang in zich een behoefte om de zaak dicht te timmeren maar daar krijg je blinde vlekken van en soms blinde razernij daarom houd ik van theologen die een beetje rafelig durven blijven
7258167 wat mijzelf betreft kan ik je antwoorden dat toen ik destijds mijn eerste ambtsopdracht ontving in 1988 als toen nog onderdiaken ik inderdaad welkom werd geheten in de kring der dienaren
7258168 ga even terug naar ons dorp en ga daarbij niet langs start
7258169 godsdienst heeft een systeemdrang in zich een behoefte om de zaak dicht te timmeren maar daar krijg je blinde vlekken van en soms blinde razernij daarom houd ik van theologen die een beetje rafelig durven blijven
7258170 slachtoffers hebben het ook voor zichzelf hard n dig om de dader vergeving te kunnen schenken want zonder dat blijven ze door hun haat angst en woede gebonden aan de dader en kunnen zij geen genezing en heling vinden door de dader vergeving te schenken ontnemen zij hem de macht over zichzelf vergeving is dus voor het slachtoffer van levensbelang
7258171 papa ik snap niet wat jij toch moeilijk vindt aan vergeven dat woord betekent gewoon v r geven weggeven de beantwoording van i c de schuldvraag willen overlaten aan iemand anders aan god of aan jezus
7258172 apostel een goed weekend als ik er maandagochtend niet mocht zijn weet u dat dit weekend de heer is gekomen
7258173 dat is recht uit mijn hart henk ik wilde dat er meer
7258174 ik weet nog dat ik jeugdleider mocht worden en ik hoorde er al helemaal bij kreeg verjaardagskaartjes van dienaren die me normaal niet zagen en toen ik geen jeugdleider meer was ook niet meer
7258175 met grote aarzeling werd pas veel later op 10 januari 1879 1949 de naam catholic apostolic church aangenomen
7258176 als je zo naar buiten kijkt kun je wel zien dat alles er niet zo maar vanzelf is gekomen er is een grote veroorzaker
7258177 look at you sleeping with your sleep here i am unable to sleep past 7am anymore and you enjoying sleep till 10am no more for me cause i have no soul i guess but you enjoying your sleep you get to enjoy
7258178 i couldnt tear myself away from 3 quarks daily to the point of neglecting my work congratulations on this superb site
7258179 i have placed 3 quarks daily at the head of my list of web bookmarks
7258180 just wanted you to know im one of many who reads and enjoys 3 quarks almost daily
7258181 hopefully i can provide some assistance in the future to this school and all that it can be
7258182 i know you are working very hard and struggling to bring up this school but i have said i will assist the school and i will do so
7258183 there was no doubt among us teachers that is what he meant we interpreted his words as meaning he would help fund the school either personally or by raising sponsors or both in order to give our school desperately needed modern facilities and a facelift
7258184 when he comes down here he will change the face of the school and believe me our poverty in kogelo will be a thing of the past
7258185 senator obama has not honoured the promises he gave me when we met in 2006 and in his earlier letter to the school he has not given us even one shilling but we still have hope
7258186 i am honoured that you have decided to rename the kogelo school in my name the land that the school is built on was donated by my grandparents and i am proud to carry on the tradition of supporting the school
7258187 when the us ambassador william bellamy came to visit the school for the official renaming ceremony in february 2006 we gave him two copies of the proposal one for the embassy and one to give to senator obama but we have not heard anything from either of them since
7258188 auma also promised to pass it on to her brother
7258189 we have no comment the family are not doing any interviews at this time
7258190 if you ask whether obamas family think he should give something to the village and to the school the answer is yes definitely but they feel it should come from him spontaneously they dont want to ask him for it
7258191 we must pay the man with the donkey to fetch us water from the river four kilometres away
7258192 i felt a calmness wash over me i felt the circle finally close i realised that who i was what i cared about was no longer just a matter of intellect or obligation no longer a construct of words i saw that my life in america the black life the white life the sense of abandonment id felt as a boy the frustration and hope id witnessed in chicago all of it was connected with this small plot of earth an ocean away
7258193 back then i was looking after 40 orphans at the orphan centre
7258194 we faced a desperate shortage of money and obama told us that he especially liked special dedicated projects like ours and wanted to help we thought he would give funds to help our project but we got nothing a few months later we were forced to shut down the orphan centre because of lack of funds just a million kenyan shillings 6 000 would have kept us going another year i feel disappointed that he did not come through

7258199 i really hope that this does not sound too forward of me but i was wondering if you might be interested in getting our boys together for a play date sometime i dont really know that many people that have boys and ive really enjoyed talking to you do you think you would be interested
7258200 hey want to hang out sometime i actually have become friends with a few of my customers outside of work so this would not be the first time this has happened to me
7258201 by now lindsay was sending i love you notes to samantha and signing them lindsay ronson but telling courtenay she loved her too
7258202 courtenay would throw fits of rage writing her hundreds of angry e mails from another room in the house

7258237 its wonderful to have this kind of audience sometimes we dont have as many but that doesnt make any difference were just glad to be doing it

7258256 organisasi misionaris ini semakin terorganisir dan sasaran mereka adalah mengkristenkan warga minang di seluruh indonesia dan malaysia
7258257 kelompok misionaris ini menilai program mereka berjalan lamban karena hanya mampu mengkristenkan seribu orang dalam lima tahun karenanya menurut informasi yang kita terima mereka pun kini bahkan sudah masuk ke sumbar agar program kristenisasi itu bisa berjalan lebih cepat
7258258 kita telah mencoba menelusuri ke berbagai pihak di sini kristen itu sendiri memiliki banyak sekte di mana setiap kita tanya mereka selalu mengelak dan satu sekte akan menunjuk sekte lain sebagai kelompok misionaris itu dan bukan mereka
7258259 tujuan utama kita adalah untuk bersama sama mengingatkan umat bahwa saat ini tengah berkeliaran kelompok kelompok misionaris yang dengan iming iming materi akan membujuk dan merayu umat agar mengikuti ajaran mereka
7258260 jika akidah dan keimanan kuat insyaallah mereka tidak akan berhasil membujuk umat agar berpindah agama

7258271 anak anak muda nu yang berada di kajian utan kayu islib itu cenderung menyalahkan kitab kitab klasik para ulama terdahulu mereka lebih menyukai pendapat pendapat hasan hanafi arkoun husain nasr dan sebagainya
7258272 padahal pemikir seperti hasan hanafi maupun arkoun dan lainnya itu sebelum menuangkan gagasan gagasannya itu saya yakin terlebih dahulu mempelajari kitab kitab klasik
7258273 tapi mengapa anak anak muda yang belum mendalami kitab kitab klasik itu malah justru mengkritik terlebih dahulu dan mengedepankan pendapatnya semata

7258277 i cant think of a better time for city council to pass this resolution than the eve of creating change
7258278 we will continue working with the aclu to help council translate this resolution into an ordinance that will protect detroits transgender residents workers and visitors like the ones coming this week for creating change
7258279 we applaud the city councils passage of a resolution welcoming the creative change conference and its statement that it opposes gender identity or expression discrimination
7258280 when it passed its human rights ordinance prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination in 1978 the city of detroit demonstrated that it was a leader among major united states cities in its commitment to diversity and equal opportunity its only appropriate that 30 years later the national gay and lesbian task force has chosen the city of detroit as its host for the creating change conference where lgbt activists and allies from around the country will convene to work towards full equality and opportunity for lgbt people
7258281 this just shows that the state of michigan is moving in the right direction in regards to state employees
7258282 we applaud governor granholms executive directive prohibiting discrimination in state employment on the basis of gender identity expression
7258283 during her second inaugural address the governor spoke about the next michigan one of transformation and opportunity todays directive brings michigan one step closer to that vision
7258284 triangle foundation is very proud of our advocacy for this essential change in state policy and we applaud the willingness by the governor to make it so
7258285 we are confident that our governors example will help to bring about fair and inclusive employment practices in the private sector as well as help move the state legislature to finally amend the states civil rights law the
7258286 our state now recognizes that an individuals capacity to establish a loving and long term committed relationship with another person and responsibly to care for and raise children does not depend upon the individuals sexual orientation
7258287 the stones we take away with us today continue a tradition started last year they are intended to represent the diversity of people that we are and to remind us that like them none of us is permanent these stones are different shapes sizes and colors just like us the smoothness of them remind us of our fragility and the weight and the roughness of them remind us of our strength i encourage you to each take a stone and carry it with you for one week and each time you see it or feel it remember again that we are all connected those of us in this room those whose memory we are here today to celebrate and indeed those who would see us murdered after we return to our seats we will go in clockwise fashion around the room reading each persons story until we are finished after the reading of each persons name i would ask that we say in unison we remember and connect again with you
7258288 dat moet je alleen doen als je daar zelf achter staat
7258289 you drive the car ill f ck him in the back seat
7258290 people expect regardless of whether were smaller or not theyll expect us to do something profoundly positive as well and leave our mark
7258291 there are a lot of pieces that need to pulled together still before we can get to a seamless operation of the games
7258292 of course they are all in play but theres still lots of work to do
7258293 we dont expect our challenge will be selling the tickets
7258294 but were not going to assume we can do things the way theyve done before and expect our seats to be full
7258295 we are for sure wanting to turn the city into a place where everybody wants to go at night to come face to face with the events
7258296 the fact is not every citizen is going to go to the competitions not every citizen can afford to go but they can all be part of the event and be downtown
7258297 when we came up with the own the podium plan in partnership with everyone else who was involved particularly the sport organizations we basically went to them and said what do you think you could do and how much money to you need to achieve it
7258298 they said we think we can be no 1 and we need 110 million we got the 110 so it would be somewhat hypocritical to say its not enough when they gave us what we asked for
7258299 we may for example ask businesses to consider opening their businesses earlier in the morning and shutting down later
7258300 i think were going to get a high degree of co operation because its been our experience that everybody wants to help everybody wants to be on the team
7258301 i see this as an area of possibilities where we think about historic neighbourhoods and what they provided to the city what they provided to the province
7258302 and if we look at those things and work on them as an integrated way i think you will see significant improvements by 2010
7258303 onze kleine meid is erg kritisch dus het duurde even voor we de juiste auto
7258304 eine l ge ist bereits einmal um die welt gegangen bevor die wahrheit berhaupt aus den startl chern kommt
7258305 sesungguhnya di surga itu ada kamar yang sisi luarnya terlihat dari dalam dan sisi dalamnya terlihat dari luar disediakan untuk mereka yang memberi makan orang orang yang memerlukannya menyebarkan salam serta mendirikan sholat pada saat manusia terlelap dalam tidur malam
7258306 nuruddin itu kecanduan sholat malam banyak berpuasa dan berjihad dengan akidah yang benar
7258307 nuruddin mahmud zanki menang bukan karena pasukannya yang banyak tetapi lebih karena dia mempunyai rahasia bersama tuhan
7258308 tuhanku betapa banyak hamba hamba mu yang berkali kali datang kepada mu memohon sesuatu yang sebenarnya tidak mengurangi sedikitpun kekuasaan mu apakah ini karena apa yang ada pada mu sudah habis ataukah perbendaharaan kekuasaan mu telah hilang tuhanku aku bersumpah atas nama mu dengan kecintaan mu kepadaku agar engkau berkenan memberi kami hujan secepatnya
7258309 jika aku mengantuk maka aku hentikan sholatku dan aku bersandar pada buku bukuku sejenak selang beberapa waktu jika telah segar kembali aku lanjutkan ibadahku
7258310 hai manusia engkau masih punya malam panjang karena itu tidurlah
7258311 akulah raja akulah raja siapa yang memohon kepada ku akan kukabulkan siapa yang meminta kepada ku akan kuberi dan siapa yang memohon ampun kepada ku akan ku ampuni dia terus berkata demikian hingga fajar merekah
7258312 play growin up and tell us a story about that god damn guitar
7258313 this is a song that almost didnt make the born in the u s a record it was this or pink cadillac weve played this a few times its good for a laugh and probably one of my most insightful songs about men and women
7258314 the price of gas is going up up up up up did you ever feel like you were held up without a gun
7258315 the nature of these negotiations leads us to believe that this outcome has been deliberately engineered by sky in order to suppress competition and coerce virgin medias customers into switching to its service by denying them access to the basic channels
7258316 this view is reinforced by skys decision to broadcast at the height of negotiations on february 12 a series of promotions claiming that the channels were about to disappear from virgin medias network this was nothing more than a heavy handed attempt to exert undue influence on the negotiating process
7258317 we have an agreement that virgin media can distribute those channels until the end of the month
7258318 virgin cannot distribute from march 1 if there is no agreement so sadly for our customers those channels would not be available
7258319 no doubt it was being used in the sense of homosexual and was capable of giving offence in this instance there was no editorial purpose which would have served to justify the potential offence and the complaints were therefore upheld
7258320 whilst there is a meaning of the word gay which may not be offensive in context broadcasters should take care about when and how frequently it is used
7258321 this is particularly true for programming that may have a significant number of children watching or listening it is possible for adults to be able to distinguish different uses of the word but it is not clear that children especially in the playground are capable of doing so
7258322 theres so much dumbing down on television im p d off that every awards ceremony has a special soap category
7258323 i dont want to be a snob but they only do it to satisfy market forces
7258324 soaps are a separate industry churned out on a treadmill with no time for any creative process so nobody gives a s
7258325 i have a soft spot for coronation street it doesnt take itself too seriously but eastenders is up its own arse
7258326 theres so much cheapness with all this reality stuff someone makes big bucks at someone elses expense and its the sadistic element of shows like big brother i find so cruel
7258327 were so screwed up with our principles we used to mock japanese game shows where they ate bugs now were doing the same if not worse its terrifying
7258328 it seems the better the quality the more youre penalised
7258329 if we bring life on mars in on time and perhaps under budget they say you can do it for less next time
7258330 if you said to a heart surgeon love your work cut your surgery time hed say the patient will die
7258331 its very frustrating when they want to hurry you up to save money
7258332 i tell them i didnt sign up for the bill lets do it properly
7258333 there are some very good people in television but a lot of fools running it
7258334 they put fame ahead of talent and think someone from eastenders will put bums on seats b if anything theyll be exposed
7258335 when i have school fees to pay you might read soap star philip glenister from dci hunt to the bill god no
7258336 for the first 15 pages i thought this is just another cop show
7258337 and then its ridiculous but suddenly bang i couldnt put it down its so ridiculous its appealing whod have thought a seventies cop show would be popular in 2007
7258338 there was talk john simm and i would be in it but id have ended up a nutter in the priory
7258339 if i was 10 years younger or didnt have children i might like to go to hollywood but its never been a burning desire and i cant be arsed now to start at the bottom of the pile im too old and cynical to go cap in hand
7258340 dan has done a good job at five and has been a wonderful colleague however we now need a creative director with the skills and expertise to run a portfolio of channels
7258341 i worked with lisa during my time at flextech and i know that she has the expertise and ability to take five into the next phase of its digital strategy and to develop our content strategy across all platforms
7258342 five has fantastic content and a unique position in the market im looking forward to working with the team to build a distinctive digital portfolio
7258343 i absolutely dont think we should do that because its not impartial its not our job to lead people and proselytise about it
7258344 it is absolutely not the bbcs job to save the planet i think there are a lot of people who think that but it must be stopped
7258345 has many public purposes of both ambition and merit but joining campaigns to save the planet is not one of them
7258346 this idea is still in development and the intention would be to debate the issue and in no way campaign on a single point of view
7258347 the thing that disturbs me most is that the bbc has such a leviathan position that if it decides that it is going to adopt climate change as a moral purpose i have got a lot of trouble with that i dont think it is the role of the bbc to spend my money on a moral purpose
7258348 it is not something to be proud of and it is something i have tried to give up on many occasions
7258349 david cameron was in the same position when he became leader of the tories but i note he was successful in giving it up so perhaps being labour leader in scotland will be the thing that will finally get me to kick the habit
7258350 iains very capable but his lack of charisma is a problem
7258351 but then the boss turned round and said in english no problem i studied at stirling university what about you
7258352 i said well i have experienced the mozambique health service and i can tell you it isnt
7258353 it is to our shame that there is significant poverty in scotland the necessity for supporting people is just as strong in scotland as anywhere else in the world the issues that concern people are the same everywhere they want the chance of a better job a decent wage they want their kids to have a decent education thats the same everywhere in the world
7258354 even in circumstances where we could barely imagine the difficulties there will always be people with aspiration and a willingness to work together and make things better
7258355 i have nothing against political banter but i do think that if you are the first minister of scotland no matter what party you come from there is a degree of dignity
7258356 i am a collar and tie politician if i go to a gala in my constituency i put a collar and tie on i might be the only one who wears it but my view is that i represent people and they are due that level of respect
7258357 my objective is to be first minister if i have learned one thing over the last four weeks it is that i want to do that even more than i thought i did
7258358 come on youre forming at the lagrangian point l4 l5

7258365 eric the night we took our dates to the restaurant on prom night i remember that i forgot my wallet and you had to pay for both of our meals
7258366 i cant accept payment on something i dont even remember
7258367 its not 91 dollars its just a gift certificate to show you that i appreciate what you did i remember that you always made people laugh and since i remember what you did i want you to have this
7258368 for i know the plans i have for you declares the lord plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you hope and a future
7258369 so it will be with the resurrection of the dead the body that is sown is perishable it is raised imperishable it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body
7258370 we will bear the likeness of the man from heaven jesus
7258371 death has been swallowed up in victory where o death is your victory where o death is your sting the sting of death is sin and the power of sin is the law but thanks be to god he gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ therefore my dear brothers stand firm let nothing move you alwasy give yourseles fully to the work of the lord because you know that your labor in the lord is not in vain
7258372 for out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks

7258409 no formal claim of responsibility has been made and the motive for the kidnapping remains unknown as well there have been no demands
7258410 it is not clear whether they are being held for political purposes as bargaining chips or for financial purposes but journalists who spoke on condition of anonymity for their security said the abduction seemed to be a pre planned attack
7258411 they were simply doing their job of reporting the story and presenting the plight of somali people to the world
7258412 and the humanitarian side of everything was is huge for amanda to bring that to the light so that people can help
7258413 mamata is a champion of the farmers cause i have come here to extend support in her fight against farmland acquisition
7258414 builders are grabbing farmers land under the mayawati regime in up we will launch a pan indian movement against farmland acquisition
7258415 we dont know if its political or a money issue
7258416 somalia has got to be the most dangerous and probably lawless place that i can think of
7258417 even foreign aid workers whove come in to try and help have become victims or have been kidnapped or killed and now these two journalists are the latest victims of the waves of kidnapping and killing that have been going on for so long
7258418 so on top of chaos clan and tribal warfare you have this ethiopian invasion which is being violently resisted by the somalis and has caused huge numbers of refugees and many deaths
7258419 there has to be a massive influx of some neutral foreign military force

7258428 we knew that we had to bring our best game and we thought after defending so well on the penalty corners
7258429 i am pretty happy i thought i had a good shot at a medal i tried to put myself in it early i came through 5k in 14 59 2 06 pace and i knew if i kept that up i couldnt finish i kept picking people off until i was 10th at about 25k then i started cramping up pretty bad my calf was cramping everything was going on me i had to stop just after 30k because my left hamstring was cramping up i put my emergency gels in my last bottles they have a lot of sodium so i drank those i didnt feel bad at all i was just cramping like crazy to be able to come here and finish ninth at the olympics its a big step for me hopefully i can continue climbing the ladder
7258430 they went out really fast i thought it was way too hard at least for me i would have died if i went out that fast
7258431 it was definitely warm out there but not as bad as i was expecting
7258432 i went out in about 1 06 20 1 03 30 and i kind of hit the wall at 35k its the olympics been great this is my first olympics its been a great experience for me everything has been great from the village to the city to the race course
7258433 it was not as bad as i had thought it wasnt stifling but it wasnt easy
7258434 today i was not thinking about the time i was only thinking about the medal
7258435 there were attempts to get rid of me many attempts
7258436 im very happy to be the winner in marathon in beijing olympics
7258437 i think if i can get a good course like berlin i can run two zero four
7258438 maybe next year i can go there and break the world record
7258439 i did the best i could with what i had
7258440 i think i can run much faster but like i said sometimes you do all the work and it comes together and sometimes it doesnt
7258441 i have a theory you should do everything before you die
7258442 muir weaves commentary thoughtful analyses and humor into a true art form
7258443 muirs genius lies in his giving context to the films
7258444 as a critic muir is acute in his analysis and as a writer he is easy to read
7258445 well grounded in the love and minutiae of sci fi and fantasy adventure
7258446 john kenneth muirs books for mcfarland are distinctive because of their authority and effective research
7258447 he really scrapes beneath the surface of the film and looks for the subtext every nuance is analysed
7258448 an independent film scholar muir explains film studies concepts in a language that is reader friendly and engaging
7258449 john kenneth muir must have had one mis spent youth
7258450 i have read quite a bit of horror film criticism and analysis in my day and john muir is one of the very best if not the best i have ever encountered
7258451 a good 18 steps above the usual dubious faux scholar blogger he takes enormous time and effort analysing unmercifully yet attuned to heretofore dismissed value every release he turns his attention to

7258473 the stresses in question are those that would be experienced in a natural disaster such as an earthquake or hurricane a terrorist attack or a sudden bereavement
7258474 the raw data suggest a two to three fold excess of schizophrenia in the cohort born in january 1968 whose mothers would have been in the second month of pregnancy in june 1967
7258475 the population of jerusalem would have been most stressed during the three days of bombardment on june 5 7
7258476 the hypothesis is that it may induce epigenetic changes but we didnt look at blood here
7258477 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war

7258483 its kind of like giving birth everybody had a different take on it
7258484 it is a watershed event in every groups existence i mean they have to have a name and a lot of them dont give it a lot of thought until they have to
7258485 ive always wanted to write a book and i finally found a subject that interested me enough and i thought other people would be interested in too

7258501 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7258502 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7258503 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

7258505 the arrests of three men over terror offences are linked to an investigation into threats to kill prime minister gordon brown the bbc has learned
7258506 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7258507 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7258508 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7258509 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7258510 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7258511 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7258512 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7258513 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

7258516 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7258517 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7258518 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7258519 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7258520 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7258521 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7258522 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7258523 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7258524 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7258525 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7258526 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7258527 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7258528 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7258529 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7258530 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

7258536 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7258537 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7258538 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7258539 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7258540 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7258541 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7258542 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7258543 who are open to doing something on the production side
7258544 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7258545 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7258546 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7258547 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7258548 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7258549 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7258550 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7258551 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7258552 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7258553 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7258554 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7258555 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7258556 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7258557 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7258558 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

7258561 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7258562 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7258563 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7258564 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7258565 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7258566 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7258567 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7258568 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7258569 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7258570 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7258571 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7258572 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7258573 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7258574 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7258575 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7258576 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7258577 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7258578 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7258579 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7258580 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7258581 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7258582 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7258583 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7258584 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7258585 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

7258595 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7258596 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

7258605 it is also becoming clear that israels economy is growing faster than all western economies even the war did not slow the pace the mirror of growth is employment which has improved greatly a total of 240 000 israelis joined the workforce in the past three years supporting themselves instead of relying on government handouts and that is the most important news for society the unemployment rate has dropped to its lowest level in a decade to 8 3 percent of the workforce compared to 10 7 percent in 2003 the number of people receiving unemployment payments fell from 97 000 in 2003 to 57 000 and the number receiving income support decreased from 155 000 to 140 000 in the same period

7258860 i suppose its right and proper that michael phelps will carry the star spangled banner in the closing ceremony but it would be a superb gesture to hand it to lolo jones this shows why and contrasts with brave paula as long as he doesnt get her mixed up with one of the sprint relay team the handover should be okay

7258867 some men came down from judea and began teaching the brethren
7258868 it is necessary to circumcise them and to direct them to observe the law of moses
7258869 brethren you know that in the early days god made a choice among you that by my mouth the gentiles would hear the word of the gospel and believe
7258870 now therefore why do you put god to the test by placing upon the neck of the disciples a yoke which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear
7258871 but we believe that we are saved through the grace of the lord jesus in the same way as they also are
7258872 you foolish galatians who has bewitched you before whose eyes jesus christ was publicly portrayed as crucified this is the only thing i want to find out from you did you receive the spirit by the works of the law or by hearing with faith are you so foolish having begun by the spirit are you now being perfected by the flesh did you suffer so many things in vain if indeed it was in vain so then does he who provides you with the spirit and works miracles among you do it by the works of the law or by hearing with faith even so abraham believed god and it was reckoned to him as righteousness
7258873 in der ersten rechtskurve bin ich nach innen gegangen doch da ist michael herck pl tzlich herein gezogen da mir der platz ausgegangen ist konnten meine bremsversuche einen zusammenstoss leider nicht mehr verhindern
7258874 ich m chte in den beiden noch ausstehenden rennen gute einzelresultate einfahren und mit den leistungen vor dem ende der saison weiter positiv auffallen und in spa war ich letztes jahr im qualifying immerhin vor timo glock
7258875 es war ein guter tag f r uns genau das haben wir gebraucht
7258876 unser auto war gut aber es war kein auto mit dem wir gegen carl edwards oder kyle busch mithalten konnten
7258877 das gibt uns selbstvertrauen und zu diesem zeitpunkt haben wir das gebraucht mehr als ein top 3 resultat k nnen wir uns nicht w nschen ich stelle mich nicht hin und fordere dass wir genauso viele rennen wie kyle gewinnen aber wir sollten in der lage sein regelm ig in die top 5 oder top 10 hinein zu fahren
7258878 wenn wir dazu in der lage sind dann sprechen wir automatisch ein kr ftiges wort um den titel mit denn es ist ja bekannt dass die konkurrenz auch einmal ein schlechtes wochenende haben kann wir m ssen uns nur in diese position bringen

7258891 the wheel of time turns and ages come and pass leaving memories that become legend legend fades to myth and even myth is long forgotten when the age that gave it birth comes again in one age called the third age by some an age yet to come an age long past a wind rose the wind was not the beginning there are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the wheel of time but it was a beginning

7258893 to look better to the public you cook the books
7258894 most hospitals never pay their bills for months and most of the suppliers are too scared to create problems because they are threatened with losing their contracts
7258895 we are a small business and we do need cash flow
7258896 its frustrating having to chase money especially when i give them goods and they get money back on the same day
7258897 its the lowest of the low for a big government agency to make suppliers hold out for payment of services and goods that they have supplied
7258898 its mean and its jeopardising some of those small businesses that have to pay their bills and staff on time they struggle to stay afloat
7258899 we have reached a conclusion that we should take off three zeroes from the current iraqi dinar banknotes
7258900 the process is progressing and we have taken some steps
7258901 the central bank governor sinan al shabibi has informed me that the bank is in the process of taking that decision
7258902 the central bank of iraq supports what the finance minister was saying
7258903 in a country like iraq where cash consists 80 of money dealing we need smaller bank notes
7258904 this time we arent in hurry if it takes two years to swap the new currency with the old one then let it so
7258905 we have reached a conclusion that we should take off three zeroes from the current iraqi dinar banknotes

7258936 we must speed up our work to achieve membership of the european system of security and raise the defense capabilities of the country
7258937 only these steps will guarantee our security and the integrity of our borders
7258938 ukraine condemns any attempts to undermine the current world order and its democratic values we condemn acts of forceful intervention and aggression
7258939 we are well aware of the threats that are emerging more and more acutely in our region
7258940 our countries are linked by years of spiritual cultural and historical ties i believe the main task now is not to allow this precious asset which we inherited from past generations to be wasted
7258941 before the biogas came the kids were just having cold washes in the winter and now they have hot water at school they dont have so many colds
7258942 i may be wearing a diaper but at least its not in my mouth have you no self respect running and jumping and throwing that disgusting thing lay down and be quiet you crazy dog lifes about belly rubs not balls

7258944 in a plain yellow font below the lighthouse the company name now zooms out from the bottom of the screen the light disappears when the lighthouse and the company name stays on the logo
7258945 the federal government should stop trying to do everything which it doesnt do well and start doing and doing better the few tasks that only it can handle
7258946 for instance uncle sam has become a nanny state telling us what we can eat and how old we must be to drink more than 100 university presidents have called on washington to reduce the drinking age of 21 maybe they are right and maybe they are wrong but this isnt a job for congress it should be the decision of the 50 states which have very different histories traditions and views of such issues
7258947 im a little disappointed not to make the top 20 but you can only do what you can
7258948 it is a huge honour to be carrying the flag at the closing ceremony when you consider the standard of the team it is a very special honour for me

7258955 many of these monuments mark watersheds in the history of our district events that have been part of bringing us to where we are today
7258956 colorado pretty nice but still land locked the last time i checked
7258957 it was a great top five definitely a great rebound from the last couple weeks
7258958 im real proud we fought hard we just couldnt get the car freed up enough there at the end and brought it home fifth so we will take that
7258959 i could have fought a little harder for third and fourth with denny hamlin and kevin harvick but it just wasnt worth it we had to come home with a great finish a top five
7258960 it wasnt the best race car that we put on the race track but it was a really good race car
7258961 we had good track position through qualifying and great pit stops everything really worked out it was kind of a flawless night in a way
7258962 im startled by the criticism giving away medals and bouquets was an international commitment for me after all im also the president of the asian athletics association i just could not be at two places at the same time
7258963 bcci is our richest sports institution and its president sharad pawar was kind enough to give rs 25 crore for the development of other games to the national sports development fund but i wanted them to raise the help to rs 50 crore a year and i am happy that pawar and bcci have decided to give rs 50 crore a year
7258964 this gesture just when the country has done so well in the beijing olympics will be welcomed by all our people
7258965 the day will come when after harnessing space the winds the tides and gravitation we shall harness for god the energies of love and on that day for the second time in the history of the world we shall have discovered fire
7258966 your one stop shopping for climate change news and views and overall round up of politics and the environment this site serves as my primary climate change information portal
7258967 ove new blog climate shifts is a welcome addition to the online coverage of climate change and coral reefs ove is one of the worlds top experts on the subject his 1999 paper on climate change and coral bleaching helped bring the problem to the attention of the public and other scientists myself included
7258968 its quite surprising to discover such a large patch of algal reefs that are relatively undisturbed by human activities
7258969 since some areas of the algae reefs have already been damaged the government should take immediate steps to better manage and protect shanyuan bay
7258970 for example coral reefs around the island have escaped bleaching because of the currents that prevent sea temperatures form rising too high
7258971 these men came near the paintings and tried to damage them they were carrying placards with jai shri ram written on them
7258972 police reached the spot soon after the incident but the miscreants managed to escape
7258973 the dcp of the area had been informed well in advance about a possible disruption but no security was provided making us an easy target

7258976 the children they just love it they cant wait for them to come out
7258977 the kids seem to know the joy they bring theres nothing like flowers
7258978 we had plenty of opportunities in the first half to put more points on them but we didnt take our chances
7258979 we paid the price for slow starts in both the first and second half
7258980 youve got to play to the conditions and we didnt
7258981 we were still enthusiastic and moving forward right to when the hooter sounded
7258982 we have not decided yet it could include a number of places and taranaki could be one of them
7258983 we still have a number of processes to go through before we have approval to make a new facility
7258984 what will happen if there is a disaster or an animal escapes it could be disastrous they have a very gung ho approach to this
7258985 the biotech bubble is going to burst its the pollution of our land i shudder to even call them scientists because the project is still in its infancy and no research has been done on the effects it may have
7258986 as a scientist i know the risk isnt zero but the opportunity is so small that we reject the idea that it could happen
7258987 for interests sake if there was some outside contamination it would not be dangerous
7258988 failed over and over and over again in my life and that is why i succeed
7258989 all we are asking for is a change or a chance to bring our own food
7258990 the food provided to offenders serving community work sentences is a decision made by the local area office
7258991 the food for this particular work site has been chosen because it is sufficiently nutritious and provides a quick hygienic and easily portable meal
7258992 but hurlstones plan to do it with one team if they run into unexpected difficulties with terrain geology or weather delays they are prepared to bring in a second team
7258993 under boring while more costly is less disruptive to householders and road users and less messy
7258994 however as new subdivisions occur on the coast the council now requires developers to set land aside as esplanade reserves and strips which in many cases has guaranteed public access to the beach
7258995 the three new subdivisions at mangahume do not affect access to the beach as they are on the cliff edge it seems the owners of the land in question where the fence has been erected want to protect some urupa sites on their land which they are perfectly entitled to do they are the same owners that have been there for many years but i guess they have decided that they dont want people going across their property anymore
7258996 it is their land and the council cannot make them let people walk across their property if they dont wish to however what we can do and have done is negotiate public access when new subdivisions are sought
7258997 i realise that access may not be as easy or convenient as previously but access will be available
7258998 we dont have limitless funds and we need to prioritise the council recently spent 150 000 improving access to arawhata rd by building a new road and carpark we maintain roads and supply toilets on stent rd kina rd paora rd and kaupokonui

7259004 but i repeat what i said he should show more respect for his opponents i also said he was a young man of 22 and he has time to mature
7259005 it is clear that china has put the bar very high
7259006 its going to be a challenge for london and also for all subsequent games i believe and my hope will be that london will put the bar higher
7259007 there are issues that london will not be able to copy or equal
7259008 a number of locations in the wolverhampton city centre area have been secured for forensic examination
7259009 the world learned more about china and china learned more about the rest of the world
7259010 the ioc is not a sovereign organisation and we have to respect chinese law

7259017 johhny johhny johhny you lost the dating argument fair and square on the science alone
7259018 we as a whole cannot date anything accurately you know it i know it other scientist know it they refuse to admit it because lord forbid if any of them are ever wrong
7259019 you lost you cant even date an eruption that we can prove in history happened
7259020 dude that whole argument smells fishy or at least squiddy they would have found them earlier if the would have gotten over their over blown egos see example above the reason no real effort to find one was scientists evos probably a few emoss as well said they couldnt possibly exist oh the high and mighty have spoken wow on there first real expedition having finally securing funds lo and behold what do they find a real live monster giant squid johnny come down off your highchair your flinging food all over and well since you think your part monkey your bound to start flinging something else whoops to late japanese fishing boats keep hauling up dinosaur carcasses
7259021 ill let mary schweitzer speak for herself and allow the people to decide flesh and blood from a 65 million year old dinosaur dragon thats still funny but you have to ask yourself why this isnt paraded around like their mighty date testing crap could be the people would see the man behind the curtain

7259024 they recently dated the new dome on top the volcano want to know how old the tests say 340 000 to 2 8 million years not only is that wrong but look at that margin not only is the error off by a multiple of 100 000 28 years 2 800 000 years but the gap between the readings is nearly 2 5 million years but that is a small camel to swallow for the camel swallowing long earth agers it has been demonstrated in the laboratory that the radiometric indicators used by evolutionists to get their great ages of the earth can be off by as much as a factor of 1 billion due to a billion fold acceleration of beta decay add to that the known errors in radiocarbon dating and you have an earth age that is dead center on the 6000 year age indicated by the genealogies in genesis and subsequent recorded histories in the tanakh so a 100 000 fold error is a small pill to swallow for these religious evolutionist nuts who have already swallowed a camel they have always gone on blind faith without any genuine bona fide evidence to support it
7259025 johnny has been as lost as a frog in a hailstorm from the very beginning of this discussion

7259041 i know how tough it is to be number one and i know i can just as easily slip back to number two or number three

7259059 the first individual gold for india in the history of olympics is a historic breakthrough and augurs well for the countrys future
7259060 i consider bindras gold medal as important as that of xu
7259061 i am sure other indian athletes will get inspired by bindras success in beijing and will try to emulate him

7259070 i am obliged to try to see the world through george bushs eyes no matter how much i may disagree with him
7259071 the report is groundless and the only evidence may come from central banks earlier move to encourage banks to lend more to small firms by allowing them to charge higher interest
7259072 the 200 400 billion yuan calculated by jpmorgan is only a guess but i agree with the point of saving the market

7259074 the election commission on friday set september 6 as the date lawmakers will elect a new president after the resignation earlier this week of president pervez musharraf
7259075 the senior party in pakistans governing coalition on friday nominated asif ali zardari widower of former prime minister benazir bhutto as its candidate in elections for president the announcement of the election date came a day after twin suicide attacks outside the countrys biggest weapons factory complex in wah 20 miles north of the capital islamabad
7259076 he has one of the worlds most dangerous jobs turning back the seemingly unstoppable tide of and taliban linked jihadi militancy sweeping across nuclear armed pakistan
7259077 and rehman malik photo above as we talk in his islamabad office makes it clear that the days of pussyfooting in pakistans fight against the militants are over
7259078 either we can hand this country over to the taliban or we can fight i am going to fight under malik pakistans policy has been transformed from one of retreat to pursuit of and the taliban but his tough rhetoric has also him a target of islamic militants
7259079 the suave 57 year old one time boss of pakistans federal investigation agency the equivalent of the australian federal police is an increasingly controversial figure as he takes pakistans war into areas it has previously avoided
7259080 in the few short weeks since malik and prime minister gilani returned from the white house pakistans much vaunted role in the war against terrorism has been transformed
7259081 suddenly and with little fanfare islamabads security forces are aggressively on the offensive in key areas where for months if not years the government had virtually given up leaving the militants to set up sharia courts
7259082 benazir bhutto appointed rehman malik as chief of the federal investigation agency fia which then launched a secret war against the taliban supporters in pakistan which amounted to a direct attack on the inter services intelligence isi
7259083 the pakistani military was equally dismayed by reports of fia contacts with the israeli secret service the mossad which had been cooperating with indian secret service raw to investigate taliban supporters on 5 november 1996 ghulam asghar head of fia and rehman malik the additional director general fia were arrested
7259084 ah right i got them on the phone indeed but they are on vacation out of town right now they try to come as fast as possible however it can take a while till they arrive

7259088 nino you are not serious are you do you really intend to play with your ds right now in this situation
7259089 why not we cannot do anything else than wait here anyway therefore i can also spend my time to continue with my game moreover you guys dont really know how i feel right now if i continue to just stand here and do nothing then i surely will go crazy because of worrying and thinking too much so please let me play my game otherwise i dont know what will happen
7259090 ohno had it with him a nurse gave it to me together with his necklace
7259091 nee sho kun did you take a look at the notebook
7259092 did you not ask yourself why there are so many drawings of yourself
7259093 actually i had promised ohno that i would not tell anybody about it but i think in this situation there is no other way
7259094 you you have scared me i didnt hear you come since when are you standing there
7259095 long enough to see that you just painted sho and you did that with such a lovey dovey look on your face
7259096 nino you must not reveal that to anybody ok no one should ever know about that this has to be a secret got that
7259097 eh but does sho know about it or will you tell him
7259098 because it would only cause problems i doubt that sho feels the same way as me maybe saying it would also even destroy our great solidarity within the group if i say it i could destroy everything im the leader i have to keep the group together therefore please dont tell anyone
7259099 but ohchan if you dont tell him then maybe you will forever
7259100 im alright drawing helps me i can put all my feelings in it therefore as long as i can transfer my feelings on the paper i will be ok
7259101 al met al was ik erg blij dat we waren aangekomen in pereira wat ook meer voelde als thuis dan mijn verblijf in bogota misschien doordat je weet dat hier familie zit of omdat je alles beter herkent of omdat je het gevoel hebt dat pereira je 2
7259102 het is toch elke keer weer aftasten als je elkaar na zon lange tijd weer ziet dus daar ligt het niet aan
7259103 its too difficult to pick up just keep it and enjoy it
7259104 walaupun sesetengah vaksin acyw 135 pada asalnya diperbuat daripada lemak babi selepas melalui pelbagai proses ia lahir sebagai bahan baru dan jelas penggunaannya dibenarkan dalam islam
7259105 vaksin ini diwajibkan ke atas jemaah haji dari seluruh dunia yang mengerjakan haji keputusan mengenai kebenaran menggunakan vaksin berasaskan lemak babi ini dibuat oleh kumpulan ulama fiqah terkenal dari seluruh dunia termasuk yusuf qardawi dalam seminar perubatan fiqh kelapan pada 1995 di kuwait
7259106 tidak timbul masalah sama ada islam atau bukan kerana dalam satu sudut orang yang bukan islam itu juga adalah jiran dan menjadi tanggungjawab kita untuk melakukan kebaikan kepada jiran kita
7259107 setahu saya tiada nas al quran atau hadis yang menyentuh mengenai doa orang islam untuk orang bukan islam bagi menyembuhkan penyakit bagaimanapun al quran mempunyai kesan besar dalam penyembuhan penyakit
7259108 di amerika syarikat sendiri ada klinik yang dibuka oleh pengamal perubatan islam dan ada juga pesakit mereka bukan beragama islam
7259109 jika berlaku keadaan darurat maka sesuatu yang haram itu boleh menjadi halal ini termasuk kegunaan vaksin daripada lemak babi yang jelas perlu bagi mengelak serangan penyakit meningitis

7259113 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
7259114 in cases where it looks like an officer needs training they direct that it happens in a timely manner
7259115 weve done a major initiative on compliance with seat belts and we attribute that decline to that directive

7259120 its unlikely that we will see another olympics of this scope and stature again
7259121 the stadium will be a very different concept to beijing
7259122 were talking about leaving a 25 000 seater all purpose stadium
7259123 the largest urban park created in europe for more than 150 years
7259124 a huge amount of our investment in the olympic park is for legacy we are cleaning up the land burying overhead power lines upgrading roads and railways and installing new energy infrastructure
7259125 a site of this scale and quality within a few minutes of a great city centre must be almost unprecedented
7259126 because there was damage to the port facility in poti we wanted to be sure the humanitarian aid got in
7259127 its highly important for us here to have representatives of the navy of our biggest friend the u s
7259128 this is a signal to the russians and the signal is we are not alone the world is with us
7259129 i dont think such a buildup will foster the stabilization of the atmosphere in the region
7259130 barbarians thats what they are they kill innocent people here how many kilometers outside the battlefield they bombed all over georgia
7259131 im an old man but i will return to abkhazia

7259134 barack has chosen joe biden to be his running mate
7259135 joe biden brings extensive foreign policy experience an impressive record of collaborating across party lines and a direct approach to getting the job done
7259136 in naming my colleague and friend senator joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee senator obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant
7259137 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgement and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realising that barack obama is not ready to be president
7259138 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7259139 im proud of our guys we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7259140 we couldnt and we havent found any identification showing they are taliban
7259141 the coalition forces have made mistakes so many times and killed so many civilians we are asking president karzai to come here
7259142 we are getting information that they are still in captivity but their whereabouts are unknown
7259143 we dont have any concrete informations on the kidnappers or where they have been taken but we are trying to find out how they are
7259144 some of the information we are getting so far indicates that the journalists were kidnapped by freelance militias who want a ransom
7259145 the pressure is going to be how do we get this war right
7259146 in the case of iraq the americans had a big strategic rethink about how they were handling it
7259147 that kind of rethink is whats going to have to take place with afghanistan
7259148 now that the situation is changing in iraq they are heading to a new front which is the one in afghanistan
7259149 were not in the blair kind of situation but it may come
7259150 in military terms i think we the french are pretty tough
7259151 our normal reaction to losing people is not to sit down and cry and then rush to the exits that is not the french way
7259152 killed more than 130 apostates wounded more than 100 and destroyed three barracks and several vehicles
7259153 the timing of course is simply the timing of when the agreement was completed
7259154 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
7259155 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
7259156 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats
7259157 fighting is still going on we hit and destroyed over 40 militants bunkers and a training camp
7259158 we have confirmed reports that 50 militants were killed while 10 of our soldiers were martyred
7259159 ich halte es f r selbstverst ndlich dass das zust ndige untergremium des haushaltsausschusses ber die neue sachlage gr ndlich informiert wird

7259164 wir sind entt uscht dass china die gelegenheit der olympischen spiele nicht genutzt hat um gr ere toleranz und offenheit zu demonstrieren
7259165 meine tibetischen br der und schwestern innerhalb tibets werden eingesperrt gefoltert oder sogar get tet wie kann ich zu einem so kritischen zeitpunkt zur ckstehen
7259166 administrativhaft von 10 bis 14 tagen ist in china m glich wenn ausl ndische staatsb rger kleinerer vergehen beschuldigt werden dies ist das erste mal w hrend der olympischen spiele dass wir von einer inhaftierung h ren die mehr als einen tag dauert
7259167 they are scared of our peaceful but massive demonstrations for freedom

7259178 defensive weapons which are not breaking the regional balance of power
7259179 playing nicely into the hands of syria which is using it to strengthen its ties with an old and resurrected friend send messages to a traditional foe israel and pressure the united states into changing course over damascus
7259180 syrias bad negotiating position is leading it to look for more weapons and to try to grow more teeth before returning to the table with israel
7259181 both assad and hezbollah are hoping to get new weapons systems from russia and greater diplomatic backing
7259182 disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7259183 visitamos las escuelas e informamos sobre las oportunidades que tiene esta actividad
7259184 no cumplir con lo que establece la constituci n ser a convertir en letra muerta ese mandato
7259185 la leg tima y tan ansiada autonom a municipal s lo se puede concretar o verse plasmada con el dictado del estatuto a trav s del poder constituyente local conformado por sus propios vecinos electos para tal cometido
7259186 cada municipio podr dictar su carta org nica mediante una convenci n convocada por el intendente en virtud de una norma dictada por la legislatura esta podr disponer la creaci n de tribunales de faltas previendo las v as recursivas ante el poder judicial

7259188 creemos que el zephyr est cerca de ser un sistema operativo aspiramos a que lo sea en los pr ximos dos a os
7259189 si algo contribuy al clima de intranquilidad que moviliz a los choferes a realizar una protesta fue la sospecha generada por la pr dica negativa de un operador ajeno a este proceso licitatorio el prestador transitorio de la l nea 19
7259190 no se trat de un lock out patronal mal pueden nuestras empresas haber promovido este conflicto cuando estamos seriamente interesados en la licitaci n nos perjudicar a de modo directo

7259194 hay una voluntad cierta de exclusi n de las empresas tucumanas a trav s de graves vicios que atentan contra los principios de igualdad concurrencia y transparencia que deben regir una licitaci n
7259195 uno debe darle importancia porque no sabemos en qu pueden terminar

7259197 nos juntamos para realizar tareas de acci n cat lica para el colegio estudiar chatear y tambi n salir
7259198 el problema radica en la falta de control de los padres
7259199 todos son chicos bien no son de las villas andan molestando todo el tiempo toman un vaso de alcohol y se creen los due os del mundo despu s cuando se meten en problemas salen corriendo a avisarles a sus padres para que los ayuden
7259200 andan dando vueltas mostr ndose quieren hacerse los poderosos ven a un chico y le pegan para demostrar que ellos son los m s picantes eso pasa desde hace mucho es una cosa normal en cualquier lado
7259201 despu s del incidente del quinteto logo se reforz la presencia policial en las esquinas de barrio norte donde se acostumbran reunirse los adolescentes no observamos pelea alguna evidentemente la permanencia de los uniformados y un mayor control por parte de los padres evit que se suscitaran las peleas
7259202 son pocas las v ctimas que denuncian la existencia de estas patotas deben demandar todos los casos de agresiones para que podamos investigar y desarticularlos
7259203 en principio l siempre da su posici n que es la misma hacerse cargo de su responsabilidad militar por sus subordinados en el marco de una guerra no es nada nuevo en lo que concierne a l
7259204 si no lleg s a ser popular sos un fracasado
7259205 los floggers famosos marcan la moda si ellos aparecen con algo nuevo lo empezamos a usar
7259206 desde que soy flogger tengo el triple de ropa de lo que ten a antes si me dicen algo en casa no nada mi pap me corta el pelo y mi mam me acompa a a comprar la ropa
7259207 somos una sociedad tranquila hacemos lo que nos gusta no molestamos a nadie pero s nos sentimos discriminados los otros chicos nos dicen que somos maricones y siempre nos quieren pegar nosotros no respondemos la violencia no va con nosotros cuando nos tiran la bronca preferimos irnos

7259210 no es una prueba relevante en realidad confirma sus dichos es decir que ella estuvo con carla paseando en moto nos duele que este caso quede en la nada
7259211 el problema es que no tenemos pruebas de que las chicas estuvieron en el cerro s lo l se ubic en la escena pero puede ser s lo una estrategia defensiva no hay nada que nos indique que hubo un homicidio
7259212 no hay nada y ella est haciendo muy bien las cosas
7259213 de las observaciones mencionadas anteriormente tiene conocimiento el se or jefe de polic a de tucum n comisario general hugo s nchez y el legislador sergio mansilla quien manifest que se tomar n las medidas del caso asegurando que las personas ubicadas en estos sectores estar n sentadas

7259216 mi conciencia me dice que el veto est bien pero la realidad es otra yo prefiero dar trabajo
7259217 lo triste es que festejamos lo que debiera ser normal parece que hay que aplaudir que en realidad el congreso legisle en vez de que la presidenta cristina fern ndez de kirchner decida como una gracia casi mon rquica y din stica qu es lo que puede ser o no debatido por los legisladores
7259218 hay que volver a leer la constituci n en particular la parte org nica que marca claramente cu les son las facultades de los tres poderes
7259219 se ores ustedes deben legislar sobre esto ya les advert
7259220 debe ser un actor mediador con tendencia a prevenir la conflictividad en esta particular materia
7259221 la carta magna da indicaciones bastante expresas por ejemplo establece la imposibilidad de permitir o favorecer el ingreso al pa s de residuos potenciales actualmente peligrosos se trata de una prohibici n absoluta
7259222 jur dicamente este es un verbo nuevo en el que deber n trabajar los civilistas adem s se consagra un derecho deber ambiental es decir no s lo el derecho ciudadano de contar con un ambiente sano y equilibrado sino que eso genera el deber de conservarlo en un contexto de desarrollo sustentable para las generaciones actuales y para las futuras

7259231 as the united states economy becomes increasingly knowledge based the concept of fair use can no longer be discussed and legislated in the abstract it is the very foundation of the digital age and a cornerstone of our economy
7259232 much of the unprecedented economic growth of the past ten years can actually be credited to the doctrine of fair use as the internet itself depends on the ability to use content in a limited and nonlicensed manner to stay on the edge of innovation and productivity we must keep fair use as one of the cornerstones for creativity innovation and as todays study indicates an engine for growth for our country

7259240 with the passage of sarbanes oxley more active enforcement of laws like the foreign corrupt practices act and anti money laundering rules and a generally heightened level of scrutiny of corporate financial reporting forensic accountants may be the most highly sought after professionals in the u s economy

7259242 i think the industry has probably quadrupled in the last seven years and over the next decade anything forensic or investigative will remain hot
7259243 we very much support the language in the bill which requires universities to provide evidence that they have a plan for implementing a technology to address illegal file sharing
7259244 such an extraordinarily inappropriate and punitive outcome would result in all students on that campus losing their federal financial aid including pell grants and student loans that are essential to their ability to attend college advance their education and acquire the skills necessary to compete in the 21st century economy
7259245 lower income students those most in need of federal financial aid would be harmed most under the entertainment industrys proposal
7259246 higher education community recognizes the seriousness of the problem of illegal peer to peer file sharing and has long been committed to working with the entertainment industry to find a workable solution to the problem
7259247 because it is added to the current reporting requirements that universities already have through the secretary of education it would have the same penalties for noncompliance as any of the others requirements under current law

7259496 once we got into the city it took us two hours to go a few miles
7259497 we didnt want to find an apartment then find a job that was too far away but at the same time we didnt have an address to put on our resumes companies dont hire you if you dont have a place to live
7259498 you really cant get an apartment without a job because they want someone with a steady income so we didnt know what to do first
7259499 it was trial and error to figure out if we wanted an apartment or job first we sent out resume after resume but it was hard because we didnt have an address to put on our resumes we only had a hotel address
7259500 he ripped us off and now we have a lawsuit filed against him to try and get our money back
7259501 we didnt think it was going to be as hard as it was so we were a little naive about the whole situation
7259502 since there are so many listings for apartments we didnt think it was going to be hard but in reality we spent weeks trying to look for a place to live
7259503 we went to a temp agency to find jobs my boss at my first job was a classic the devil wears prada boss
7259504 even though walking into the big e building was intimidating it was a much better fit thats when it finally hit me that i wasnt in monroe anymore i had found a permanent job
7259505 i really like it especially the creative portion of the job i get to work with designers on projects and ive met some celebrities
7259506 working with beauty products is a great start but my ultimate goal is to work in fashion
7259507 music com is really just launching so i wear a lot of hats im having fun with it
7259508 i eventually want to find a job in graphic design but this is a good start im learning a lot
7259509 it was very emotional but i felt like something else was out there for me i didnt want to have any regrets
7259510 i always wanted to pursue something outside of monroe i knew i could get a job in monroe but i felt i could do more
7259511 i hate being apart from them and its been an adjustment for everyone
7259512 but they never said anything negative or told me what i was doing was wrong my mom asked me a couple times if i was really going to do it but as time got closer to leave she knew i wasnt backing out
7259513 i always knew that i would go somewhere else to live as much as i love monroe i just always felt that way and my parents knew that too
7259514 i didnt plan on moving to the other side of the country but my family has been very supportive
7259515 being out here makes me really glad that i grew up in monroe it makes me appreciate where i came from

7259561 we are naturally disappointed but in a way the postponement is a victory for us under these circumstances there were only two solutions either to relocate the event to sri lanka or postpone it
7259562 had it been relocated it would have deprived us of the hosting rights
7259563 we are sure that the event will be held in pakistan next year
7259564 so that they can shoot us in the back again
7259565 this is no longer 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia

7259578 the region of the south caucasus and central asia could produce oil and gas in sufficient quantities to reduce the dependence of the united states on energy from the volatile persian gulf region
7259579 in the caspian black sea region the european union and the united states have concentrated on setting up a reliable logistics chain to connect central asia with the european union via the central caucasus and turkey ukraine the routes form the centerpiece of inogate an integrated communication system along the routes taking hydrocarbon resources to europe and traceca the multi channel europe caucasus asia corridor projects the traceca transportation and communication routes grew out of the idea of the great silk road the traditional eurasian communication channel of antiquity it included georgian and turkish black sea ports poti batumi and ceyhan railways of georgia and azerbaijan the baku tbilisi ceyhan oil pipeline ferry lines that connect turkmenistan and kazakhstan with azerbaijan across the caspian sea lake turkmenbashi baku aktau baku railways and highways now being built in turkmenistan uzbekistan kyrgyzstan kazakhstan and china as well as chinese pacific terminals as strategically and systemically important parts of the mega corridor

7259602 it is really important that obama responds to the charge that he is elitist democrats dont want the criticisms to take hold and affect public opinion

7259604 how can john mccain fix the economy when he doesnt think its broken
7259605 just because the other side is fighting dirty it doesnt mean we have to stoop to their level

7259607 these attacks can be unpleasant and a cause of anxiety but this exchange is important its very informative for voters the american public needs to know not only if obama can take a punch but if he can throw one the image of obama is that he is cerebral he needs to show that he has a gut instinct and that he can be a street fighter
7259608 heres one house american cant afford to let john mccain move into

7259629 however there was also a realisation that under the current circumstances some of the teams due to compete had reservations about touring there which could not be removed
7259630 in those circumstances it was considered prudent to postpone the event to october 2009 a time when we all hope conditions will be more acceptable for all the competing teams
7259631 if other members continued to express reservations over issues of safety and security then the icc would have the right to decide about the tournaments location

7259706 our findings highlight a risk associated with alcohol dependence in women that is not widely recognised a risk that has assumed increasing importance given the increased rates of alcohol misuse by women and particularly young women
7259707 young women who drink alcohol may want to consider the longer term consequences for later childbearing
7259708 if drinking continues or increases to levels of problem use their ability and opportunity to have children may be impaired
7259709 the observation is that they will have less reproduction and delayed reproduction
7259710 while the affect may be hormonal women with alcohol dependency probably dont make good partners thats another possible explanation i think we have to consider the direct behavioural consequences of alcohol too
7259711 it is a diagnosis that should not be used in anything other than a tiny fraction of cases in which it is made

7259775 our dna analysis corroborates what the historical sources say namely that vanilla was a trade item brought to tahiti by french sailors in the mid 19th century the french admiral responsible for introducing vanilla to tahiti alphonse hamelin used vanilla cuttings from the philippines the historical record tells us that vanilla which isnt native to the philippines was previously introduced to the region via the manila galleon trade from the new world and specifically from guatemala
7259776 the pre columbian maya had been managing their forests for millennia to cultivate cacao and to make chocolate and we know they were also cultivating vanilla to use it as a chocolate spice the maya created these forest gardens by introducing different types of species of wild cacao and vanilla from the surrounding forests which meant that species that had previously been geographically separated were then able to hybridize because they were in the same place thats the scenario we present in our research paper for how tahitian vanilla got started it is an evolutionary product but also a maya artifact
7259777 pesach has demonstrated that vanilla species can exchange genes quite frequently across species barriers
7259778 this provides an opportunity to breed new commercial varieties of vanilla through hybridization in the future

7259817 heaven the essentiality of being where everything achieves its full authenticity is already close to us in friendship
7259818 few things are as healing and life giving as is friendship between woman and man man and woman
7259819 a man needs something which is more than friendship and yet is not love as it is generally understood this something nevertheless a woman only can give
7259820 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
7259821 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know

7259823 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers

7259825 in this kingdom the distinctions and barriers between male and female were to be broken down to actualize the potential of any love in this case a male and female love of friendship can be to participate in the building of a kingdom of love spiritual friendships shared by men and women can be eschatological signs
7259826 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy

7259829 large corporate companies rely on anti virus products to protect their infrastructure but the problem with this approach is that these products only detect around 60 of threats out there in the right hands viruses can easily bypass these programs as was the case here
