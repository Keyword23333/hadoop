120000 hmmm on your last night thats not a good sign
120001 although i guess hed seen a lot of you in the previous couple of weeks
120002 hes also put pics on his facebook profile which make the two of them look like a couple and the other guys even met some of his family now ive met a few of his friends but not as many as the other guy and none of his family
120003 well thats not surprising because you dont live in the same city as boyfriend p do you and presumably the other guy does
120004 if we ever do live in the same city he suggested recently that we should date for a while rather than living together
120005 really what does he think that the two of you have been doing over the past few years if not dating
120006 i told him i didnt have any interest in dating after all the time weve spent in each others company if he doesnt know now that id make a good boyfriend then i dont think hell ever know i think he ended up accepting that dating wouldnt be necessary
120007 because after a couple of weeks in my company well be making plans about our future but as soon as im not there it all swings off in another direction i dont mind if he has other boyfriends of course but he keeps saying that he only wants one boyfriend if this other guy turns out to be mr big that means i get dumped and that would hurt a lot i get the impression that the only reason that hasnt happened yet is because the other guy doesnt want a relationship just yet i really do love him mate but sometimes it feels like weve been all the way through a deep relationship from start to finish without even ever having lived in the same country i also dont want to end up being boyfriend ps boyfriend and feel that hes settled for 2nd best for the rest of my life perhaps i just need the courage to move on
120008 what about boyfriend r do you ever see him these days
120009 no and ive got no inclination to either although hes a lovely sweet guy hes just too screwed up
120010 well gb i did used to enjoy the posts about your encounters if you do broaden your horizons again i hope that well all be able to read about it
120011 marked the biggest break up of the ice for three years
120012 the scientists say they believe the split was almost certainly caused by the warming climate which is affecting polar regions more than anywhere else the break up of ice known as calving is regarded by scientists as being symptomatic of the warming of polar areas
120013 ninety percent of the decreasing sea ice extent is empirically accounted for by the increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

120017 do we want to hand over our nuclear the british nuclear industry to the french government
120018 ofgems terms of reference suggest it may pay relatively little attention to the wholesale markets
120019 earn outs are normally seen in creative and knowledge intensive industries such as technology and pharmaceuticals where there may be genuine differences of opinion over the value of the intellectual capital the seller is bringing to the table here there are hard albeit ageing assets in the form of eight nuclear plants sites for a lot more and a tangible trading history if a structure emerges as reported it will reflect a cash strapped treasurys determination to keep buyers onside as long as an earn out lets a value discrepancy stand between buyer and seller both sides are forestalling the inevitable as with the consumer credit bubble somebody will win eventually and somebody will lose
120020 london bosses are being urged to raise the minimum level of pay to 7 45 per hour to help tackle obscene levels of poverty and depravation mayor boris johnson said he had raised the london living wage by 25p an hour to meet the increasing cost of living he said he expected the new rate to be the basic standard for all employers from next month tube cleaners will be paid the new rate after a series of protests called on their employers to pay them a fair wage speaking on monday mr johnson said he was stepping up the campaign to persuade london employers to ensure all staff are paid at least 7 45 per hour this is not only morally right but makes good business sense contributing to better recruitment and retention of staff higher productivity and a more loyal workforce with high morale he said
120021 sisters harriet has taken us to the promised land already equality here we come

120025 anguished cries will ring out from cubicles around north america today
120026 since the school is under use we were expecting more in take next year
120027 no sooner had i started moving to the construction site than i saw students running when i went to the scene i saw fire we tried to contain it with fire extinguishers together with the officer in charge of ndejje police station until the fire brigade came
120028 we had locked the dormitories because the students were doing examinations
120029 some students who were behind the dormitory heard an explosion we all ran and tried to save the dormitories but the fire spread very fast
120030 we believe it could have been arson because there was a blast but we have not yet concluded
120031 the faculty of law has already moved to write to the university council warning that this decision will not be accepted by the academic staff the idea was poorly conceived and if we are to be laid off they will have to immediately pay our terminal benefits
120032 if fixed term contracts are introduced the existing ones would have to be terminated in accordance with the existing terms the council should be fully prepared to meet the consequences of such departure from the existing contractual terms with the staff
120033 we are paid to teach government sponsored students we cannot be forced to teach evening students for free

120045 its not so much a legal defeat for cuban as it is an old fashion butt whipping
120046 cubans lawyers did a great job of trying to disguise their pig with lipstick and jewelry but unfortunately for them it kept oinking
120047 the weather is supposed to be perfect firefighting weather today
120048 no significant winds and its not too hot and the humidity has come up a little bit
120049 i kept hoping for the best so hearing its gone just kind of took the wind out of me
120050 it staggers the brain to think about how much devastation a fire can have how many people this affects
120051 typically we dont see wildland fires of this magnitude until much later in the season
120052 but with the dry fuel conditions that we have throughout the state we could see similar situations arise again until we get a significant amount of rain
120053 protect my family and me forgive my sins and help me guard against pride and despair give me the wisdom to do what is right and just and make me an instrument of your will
120054 nobody thinks george w bush and john mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face
120055 so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
120056 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
120057 he was describing that he was new to the political scene
120058 he was referring to the fact that he didnt come into the race with the history of others it is not about race
120059 the government is investigating ranbaxy and certain of its employees concerning possible violations of federal laws
120060 the government has reason to believe that these violations have resulted and continue to result in the introduction of adulterated and misbranded products into interstate commerce with the intent to defraud or mislead
120061 allegations from reliable sources indicate a pattern of systematic fraudulent conduct
120062 under these circumstances the company finds that the allegations are baseless
120063 the companys business in the united states continues as normal ranbaxy remains committed to providing high quality generic medicines
120064 if true these statements would call into serious question whether the leadership of the agency have met even the minimum requirements of due diligence
120065 with no exercise you can take a drug and chemically mimic it
120066 honestly i just dont know how that happens whether it would happen in a person i dont know i think its a small miracle it happened at all
120067 our feeling is there has been a dead zone at the epa almost as big as in the gulf of mexico
120068 they have the responsibility to act the deadline came and went a long time ago and most of our states dont have standards
120069 were looking at a total ecological shift in the gulf as far as what lives there
120070 when the epa set out its requirement in 1998 it was recognized that this was not just a local problem because nitrogen and phosphorus pollution are the leading causes of water impairment in the united states
120071 i can understand why the senator would like to have this matter concluded before the election
120072 i knew that our ordinance would not survive constitutional scrutiny
120073 some communities are truly seeing what is contained in the supreme court decision and theyre reacting appropriately
120074 others want to spend taxpayer money on some don quixote type quest
120075 we have no plans to amend our ordinance at this time
120076 were prepared to take this fight to the supreme court if necessary
120077 we want to have a stimulus package that creates jobs for economic development and also for disaster assistance
120078 i have serious doubts about whether we really need a second stimulus bill and i have even greater doubts about what it would look like out of this democrat controlled congress
120079 itll just be a giveaway that is well meaning and well intentioned but a big waste of taxpayers dollars and i dont think thats what most taxpayers want
120080 there is no question we would like a second stimulus package we think the economy needs it
120081 but it should be deeper and put its tentacles more into the economy than just a rebate which might be necessary as well
120082 a stimulus package by nature is counter cyclical you have to do it because youre having a downturn in the economy
120083 but if you do it in a way that weights you down with more budget deficit then what are you accomplishing
120084 clearly the stimulus plan has supported the u s economy during this difficult period and couldnt have been timelier
120085 american families spent companies invested and benefited from strong export growth
120086 look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
120087 the 64 000 question is whether senator john mccain s surge is a result of senator obama s much publicized middle eastern and european trip or just a coincidence that it occurred while senator obama was abroad
120088 dont look at my lies inconsistencies and lack of support for the troops card
120089 the executives current claim of absolute immunity from compelled congressional process for senior presidential aides is without any support in the case law
120090 we disagree with the district courts decision we are reviewing it and once we have had a chance to do that well consider whether the decision should be appealed
120091 presidential autonomy such as it is cannot mean that the executives actions are totally insulated from scrutiny by congress that would eviscerate congresss historical oversight function
120092 rests upon a discredited notion of executive power and privilege
120093 it is the judiciary and not the executive branch itself that is the ultimate arbiter of executive privilege
120094 permitting the executive to determine the limits of its own privilege would impermissibly transform the presumptive privilege into an absolute one yet that is what the executive seeks through its assertion of ms mierss absolute immunity from compulsory process
120095 were eating this same produce in mexico and we havent had any problems
120096 if you know the problem is there you can start addressing the problem
120097 it significantly impairs your ability to stay independent which is what people want
120098 it was something that has kind of been on my mind in general and once i started looking at balance it became very clear it would have applications in that direction
120099 poor balance isnt something you have to accept you can help yourself you can improve balance
120100 the event is far more family friendly than in previous years
120101 the failure occurred deep enough in the slope that i dont think a bolting program would have prevented it it was just too big
120102 john mccain and the republicans they dont have any new ideas
120103 he used similar language at two other campaign stops that day
120104 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
120105 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue
120106 but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
120107 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me
120108 hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name
120109 the republicans will be happy to play the race card
120110 the mccain camp watched our side in the democratic primary very carefully
120111 they heard something that senator obama said and they felt that they had to respond quickly to make sure that nobody got the impression that they were engaged in those kind of racial politics
120112 despite the magnitude of the horror i think everybody is safe on the bus
120113 safe reliable courteous has been the companys trademark and its always followed up on safety
120114 this couldve happened in a taxi cab it couldve happened on a train anywhere the guy decided to flip out and he happened to choose the bus
120115 im not nervous at all because i take the buses all the time
120116 the drivers are always very friendly and this kind of thing never happens
120117 he wants to be able to see who he puts on the bus
120118 he acted very intelligently some drivers wouldnt have thought of shutting the power off i give him credit for that
120119 if he was smart enough he couldve opened any window on the bus
120120 were waiting for funding from transport canada but im not sure what for
120121 were going to have to discuss safety screening for weapons
120122 its another added inconvenience but its a necessity thats coming were going to have to do something bus service has always been safe and economical are times changing yes for sure
120123 mostly ive had problems with people drinking but nothing i couldnt handle on my own
120124 this past fall i put two people off the bus they were drinking and causing a disturbance
120125 you cant throw them off the bus in the middle of nowhere
120126 all buses are equipped with cell phones and two way communication systems

120133 i knew steve would get a chance somewhere down the road
120134 i have nothing but great things to say about the people i worked with in vancouver
120135 i promised myself i was not going to move just for that gm position
120136 when i did move it would be for the right one and this is the right one
120137 steve is the strongest candidate in hockey at the executive level that wasnt a gm
120138 we realize there are more and more demands in this business at this level in order to get the job done you need many people doing it
120139 i was going to make some fairly significant changes anyways
120140 the pain wasnt so sharp i felt so weak in my right arm i couldnt hold my racquet on the forehand side it was very frustrating
120141 im fine i have no pain im just trying to get stronger on this knee little by little im getting better and moving better
120142 at the important times i really raised my level and won it in two sets
120143 but this is good for the future you learn little things playing against a world no 2
120144 wozniak is a little more aggressive she goes for it a bit more and tends to make a lot more unforced errors
120145 dubois is more consistent she moves really well its hard to make a point on her you really have to earn it
120146 i actually beat the ranking record which was 142 i think im about 120 now no 142 is the greatest portuguese player in history
120147 the system is broken people dont have confidence in the process and they feel they arent being treated fairly
120148 when there are instances of death or serious injury suffered by a civilian at the hands of the police there has to be an independent investigation
120149 the opcc has no role in the investigation no ability to change the investigation or the decision made by the police department it has oversight and can act if there is something obviously biased in the process and call a public hearing
120150 but these are expensive and take a long time and are only used in the most serious of complaints
120151 i agree with their frustrations we are endeavouring to operate with a police act that needs some work but a boycott isnt the answer
120152 we share many of their concerns and we have been advocating reform of the police act since 2003
120153 in 2005 we issued an annual report asking for all kinds of changes
120154 does not share their view on having incidents involving the police investigated by civilians
120155 this position was taken by former court of appeal justice josiah wood who did an extensive review of the police act in 2007 and found the police should still investigate themselves but the opcc needed enhanced powers of oversight
120156 most of these relate to police misconduct and in the past wed refer them to the opcc

120227 what they found lacking was the depth of understanding and vision in dealing with complex international and security issues articulation to comprehend and project pakistani policies in a clear and candid way more so on public places than in closed door meetings they did not find the will and the capacity in the prime minister to grasp the importance of issues take control of matters and make decisions which he could sustain
120228 the one issue which damaged gilanis credibility as a potentially serious leader and policy maker was the brutally botched up isi fiasco whoever did this to gilani actually torpedoed his us visit which turned into a non starter the moment the isi notification was withdrawn it was beyond gilani to stand by his order for more than a few hours and washingtonians got the message that they were dealing with a non entity and should not take him seriously
120229 but the moment the script was over and he had to answer questions the level of discourse and understanding came crashing down to earth the contrast was so stark and embarrassing it discounted both the images gilani presented and made him look like artificial and someone who was being remote controlled
120230 some information in the cia charge sheet were so damning that the pakistanis could not deny them

120465 the room we record and practise in is an upstairs room in a community centre in sunderland which weve been in since 2001 i wouldnt exactly call it a favourite space we cant really afford anything else but it is incredibly practical especially as we record ourselves and tend to spend quite a lot of time making our records the school of language record was recorded over about five months we share rent on the room between the three members of field music myself my brother peter and our schoolmate andy moore the futureheads and a guy called peter stebbing who occasionally features in a band called the amateur dramatics there are eight of us in total hence calling the studio 8 music ingenius eh me and the other field music ers are the only people who really use it as a studio for everyone else its primarily a practise room though everyones recorded bits and pieces there the building is a an old 1930s school building at some point probably in the 70s this became a sixth form college and now its a community enterprise building theres a creche people training to be gas fitters and a few rooms to do computing courses in the building our room is about 25 x 12 so its quite big the walls are covered by charity shop curtains which dont keep provide any sound insulation at all but do stop high frequencies bouncing around the room too much in fact its not sound proofed at all though the walls are quite thick and my dad who works for a building company and is very handy helped us fit an extra door and a second layer of double glazing over the windows unlike most studios we do get some daylight in which can really improve the atmosphere of the room and of course we can open them mid practise if it starts to get a little sweaty very little in the room is specifically geared towards it being a studio again because we simply cant afford that kind of thing so the fluorescent lights buzz and rattle and the walls are square to each other which is acoustically bad because it generates standing waves and its quite difficult to control the bass frequencies bouncing around the room contains an assorted jumble of amps guitars keyboards and studio bits it changes depending on whos on tour or whos busy rehearsing recording at any particular time keeping the room organised has become really important as weve all become busier you dont dont want to get home from a long tour and find theres no space to put your drum kit weve had the same mixing desk for over ten years an allen amp heath gs3 which we bought from peters student loan money to do a six month community recording project in 1997 its seems slightly crazy that i set up my own studio when i was only 17 writing out funding applications and sorting out insurance and paying rent over the last two years the desk has seen a lot less action as both me and my brother have been recording and mixing on computer its been quite important for us to have a real piano in the studio in fact we have two one mini upright and one portable electric grand a late 70s relic despised by roadies everywhere but with a really unique sound theres no way to replicate that sound as much as our equipment isnt far beyond what you might have in a bedroom studio having the space to record acoustic instruments live in a room or in the corridor outside the room or the toilets underneath etc capturing the air bouncing around is really important to us those field music records might sound quite pristine but you couldnt describe them as being highly produced just us in our little funny sounding room with three cheap microphones on the drums how much time we spend in the studio depends on whats going on while we were recording tones of town the three of us would be in the studio for four or five plus hours on an afternoon maybe three days a week when we were rehearsing for the tot tours wed do four afternoons a week and leave ourselves the rest of the time to do admin i always tend to gravitate to working on mornings for a whole host of reasons but partly because no one else really wants to be in the studio then the school of language album was mostly recorded in sessions between 9am and 1pam going in every day and then also doing a couple of evenings every week id also work on editing or mixing on the laptop at home or wherever i happened to be in a cafe on the train in a hospital waiting room luckily though i live really close to the studio just a ten minute walk theres a little bit of room for more spontaneity and i can always just record at home if i need to capture an idea quickly peter and i both write with a pretty clear idea in our heads of how we want the finished recording to sound for us a song isnt just a set of chords and some lyrics there are always lots of arrangement and production ideas in there from the very beginning maybe because of that it is often easier for us to work on our own and for school of language recording i think ill keep it fairly solitary its quite nice at the moment though having spent most of last year playing and recording on my own to get in the practise room with some other musicians and rock out and jump in a van and head out on tour for writing its easiest if im a little bit bored have a few journeys to make on the metro ideal thinking time and maybe a few cups of strong coffee it tends to be a back and forth process between sitting with a guitar or at the piano and having time to let my thoughts wander i find it difficult if not impossible to write on tour and i rarely write in the studio other than just coming up with fragments on the piano with the school of language albums any demo ing of ideas was done straight into the computer that way the demo can actually provide the basis of the finished recording even if there are loads of mistakes or the structure isnt in place rockist pt 1 disappointment 99 and extended holiday all came from very early demos and most of the others are just a generation or two removed we dont have a great deal of equipment i have two electric guitars an old sg and a jazzy ibanez semi acoustic two regular basses a precision and a funny short scale squier musicmaster which only cost 99 brand new and an epiphone acoustic we only really use one guitar amp a reissue of a 1965 fender deluxe reverb though occasionally ill dig out something else like one of those tiny toy marshall stacks or this six watt fender champion ive been using for gigging for bass we use whatevers around maybe jaffs ampeg or ours or the deluxe again and take care how we mic it up weve had the same pearl drumkit for about 16 years but now with a gretsch snare drum and reluctantly replaced cymbals we dont have a huge stock of microphones either two rode nt1 condensors three akg c1000s a rode valve mic with switchable polar patterns and a cheap nady ribbon mic it would be great to have a couple of really expensive great sounding microphones but i also quite like the limitations of working with so little equipment its encouraged us to be a little bit more creative with where we put the instruments in the hall at the top of the stairs in the ladies toilets and how we mic them
120466 we want to improve the quality of life for our employees both their personal time and their family time and give them a little more flexibility in what they do on and off hours
120467 for me its wonderful because i live in wahiawa and i catch the bus so it will be less bus riding and then on the last day i can spend more time with my family
120468 we are also hoping that this pilot project may help us as far as recruitment and retention is concerned with state employees
120469 we got those questionnaires and surveys back there were 27 out of the 100 or so employees who voiced any concerns and who indicated they had challenges
120470 i wont call them resolutions yet because we would like to see how it works
120471 i am not as concerned about me in particular i just want us to do things that as a state thats innovative and looks for different approaches to solve our energy problem and solve our traffic problems

120474 so much of the focus on this issue has been in africa but there the interface between humans and other primates is decreasing the intensity of bush meat hunting and infectious diseases have taken a huge toll on primate populations there individuals in africa who are interacting with other primates are often very isolated from other humans they live in small rural villages which limits the potential spread of pathogens
120475 some macaque species thrive in human altered environments given the tolerance of the local people
120476 this is a heterogeneous sample subjects reported contact with primates in a variety of contexts it seems that some of these contexts are going to be very important but they havent been studied much zoo workers and bush meat hunters have been typically considered at the highest risk for viral transmission but none of the zoo workers or hunters in our sample tested positive for sfv

120491 i was shocked to see what it looked like myself
120492 obviously you hate to jump to tommy john right off the bat
120493 but i think its to the point where its kind of foolish to try to rehab for five months and try to let it heal that way i think the damage is beyond trying to heal itself
120494 if he has surgery im going to obviously do all i can to try to come back next year and help this team win
120495 you know what those things will take care of themselves
120496 i want to come back and be strong next year and whatever happens happens
120497 the surgeries today are pretty good as far as coming back at 100 percent
120498 im not really concerned with if i have it am i going to be 100 percent after the surgery
120499 its hard to sit here and not play when you feel fine
120500 but at the same time if i go back behind home plate and catch a foul tip in the mask and im not completely healed its going to make my concussion a lot worse
120501 i just need time to rest just make sure be overly cautious i think monday will be a week i think thats what youre trying to shoot for

120510 i was wondering what was going to happen with the baby waiting to see if he moved
120511 he comes in and says theres no easy way to tell you this but your son maybe has some kind of heart defect
120512 they werent sure if it was a hole in his heart or what but there was blood and fluid all around his heart
120513 i was actually showing what was wrong with the baby because he couldnt show it
120514 but the doctor told him youre going in that room because your baby is going to have a 25 percent chance of making it out of that room alive he said it didnt look good and he wasnt going to sugar coat it for us
120515 but i said no my baby will be fine i felt it
120516 i knew as soon as they cut him out that he was going to make it
120517 i stayed at allegheny general and they said they would call when the surgery was over
120518 it seemed like eternity but they called and said he was out of surgery that he was doing better
120519 and from there it was just a matter of him getting bigger and stronger
120520 hes five months old and he should be doing more than hes doing
120521 i dont ever want to think hes perfect because i dont know whats going to happen right now hes doing well
120522 were just going day by day we never know whats going to happen or whats going to come our way

120529 theres a line that separates having confidence and being conceited i dont cross that line but i have a lot of confidence in myself
120530 thats what i said i am a confident player and a lot of people might look at it like oh another cocky attitude but i dont look at it that way
120531 i have an opinion i have a right to have one and thats the way i feel i felt ive played against the best over the years and felt right now that im the best player in the world
120532 you could have asked me about any other player and i would have given you the same answer
120533 i would have said that if he thought bryant was conceited
120534 i think the lakers are a great team but i think they ran into a better team
120535 they lakers beat the best in all the western conference they had the guy who was named mvp and the best record after the arrival of pau gasol but they just ran up against the better team
120536 i think they will be a great team next year maybe well see them back in the finals
120537 hes just not dealing with the same set of cards he had in spring training
120538 hes got a great combination of strength and physical size
120539 he moves pretty well its a battle every time you go out there and see him across from you
120540 i am not a receiver i am not built to be a quarterback i take pride in doing the dirty work that is it i always have but being nose is just that i feel like it is one of the most important positions you have on the defense
120541 whats nice is even when his hands are not inside and he doesnt have the proper leverage theres a lot of other things that he can rely on to not get moved
120542 its olive oil but they infuse it with truffles so its heart healthy
120543 a lot of people know that the game has to be over for an hour before i believe its over

120548 when you stop breathing in your sleep you dont know it it doesnt typically wake you up
120549 our findings along with those from the wisconsin cohort remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
120550 it is likely that our findings may underestimate the mortality risk of sdb in other ethnic groups or the lowest socio economic strata where there is poor awareness and access to health care

120578 joey will be requesting a personal hearing in relation to the charge

120607 paul is a real adventurer a sports fanatic and a trained physiotherapist he had been in california for about a week and sky dived every day over recent years he has done at least 100 sky dives in places like orlando germany and spain and was on his fourth of the day
120608 but when he was approaching the landing mark he made an adjustment the parachute spun out of control the canopy hit the ground first and paul crashed to the ground we dont know how he survived it indications are that his spine and head were not seriously injured and as a christian he is asking everyone at home to pray for him
120609 frankly im astounded that he survived he was in terrible shape and was in the theatre of the local hospital for eight hours
120610 i saw it all and my immediate reaction was that he was a goner
120611 he is out of the intensive care unit and into the general ward and the doctors tell me he will make a full recovery but it will take time hes a strong fit young man had it been the like of myself that would have been it
120612 i wasnt tutoring paul i was in charge of a group of younger men but i landed beside him and we had him in hospital within 10 minutes and are relieved that hes going to be ok its was a harrowing experience all round
120613 well do all we can to help his dad when he arrives and were delighted to have good news for him
120614 we may set up a fund to finance the situation but the first priority is to see for myself how paul is coping
120615 after his hospital stay in america he will be coming home but the prognosis is that he could take two years to recover
120616 it will be an awful burden for a young man who is fanatical about his sport
120617 he has just landed a job as a fitness instructor with the council in castlederg and he was planning to go to a base camp at mount everest next year on a fund raising campaign to raise money for disabled sports people
120618 he has paid his 500 deposit for that adventure and was in the process of raising another 2 800 but all that will be placed on the long finger
120619 it will be very difficult as he fights back to full fitness he has been involved in sports like amateur boxing karate track and field events and he will find this very tough
120620 as a result of having various tubes down his throat during his time on a life support machine he cant actually talk but im told thats coming back although hes had to write to communicate with the doctors and nurses and his instructor john horne who rang me to tell me he doesnt know how paul came out of it alive
120621 i can only hope and pray he will make a full recovery and can pick up the pieces of an active useful life but hes determined and competitive and we are optimistic he can make a 100 recovery
120622 reporting hate crime is one way of ensuring that further incidents are prevented and offenders are brought to justice we want to encourage people whether they are victims of a crime or witnesses to an incident to report it to police
120623 there are a number of methods available to make reports either in person via telephone email letter or alternatively online reporting
120624 the bluetooth message is clear and simple hate crime is unacceptable no one deserves it and no one deserves to get away with it
120625 since he ran so well in the pierse handicap hurdle at leopardstown as black queen had done too we hoped to come here and get a little winterish ground
120626 we were planning to run them both but the going today would have suited indian pace better
120627 the blinkers helped to keep him going and pauls 5lb claim was a help as well with just a length to spare

120638 you can save quite a bit of money especially if you have several kids going back to school
120639 youll see a lot more laptops on campus than desktops
120640 laptops are definitely the way to go for college students
120641 their living quarters are small and with a laptop they can take it to the library when they need to get away from their roommate or to find a place to work on projects with other people
120642 if youre outfitting a student who is studying any type of media design or web design macintosh computers are far superior to pcs mayer said
120643 you can upgrade ram later if you need to and you can always add an external hard drive if you need more space later but its much harder and more expensive to upgrade the processor

120645 we evaluate every situation on a case by case basis and have no comment regarding the scrabulous developers new application at this time
120646 were encouraged that the developers of scrabulous are continuing to build new and innovative games for users one of the things thats important with all of the new innovation from third parties on facebook platform is that as part of the developer terms of service developers own the intellectual property for the applications they build and attest that their applications do not infringe on any copyright or trademark laws
120647 its going to come down to the little things like squares and circles and double triple and so on
120648 what theyve done is taking a step in the right direction but i dont think its a big enough step

120654 honestly we feel a need to get flo throwing better he needs to get his work in thats tough to do here
120655 it also allowed us to make a roster move with carpenter right now we cant put our team in a position to give him the exposure he needs while we may want to get something in the next couple days its not meant as a precursor to anything
120656 im going to try to work on things from different angles but right now there doesnt seem a high probability of getting a deal done
120657 he wasnt sharp early but the other starters are watching how he handles those situations thats why his value goes beyond the day he pitches
120658 its fun to get out there and compete at this level this is what its all about

120662 im really happy we won but the best thing today was to see him back on the mound
120663 in the fourth i was able to get the ball down my cutter was better my breaking ball was better the location of my fastball on both sides was better but by then im out of pitches
120664 i was a little rusty going into the game but i was trying to stay sharp if for nothing else for him
120665 hes a team leader everybody knows that carp and albert
120666 since all the votes have been cast before the meeting all thats really left is the theater
120667 i want to hold this board and management team accountable for the last year

120673 on this job were not taking on our normal role
120674 it was a matter of gateway wanting to have 100 percent confidence it was right
120675 we dont have to do a lot of rework we dont end up in court
120676 you not only have to build it but you have to guarantee it for a little bit longer
120677 this is to ensure if we did happen to miss something from this audit oversight process we have a one year warranty
120678 we have a little more of a cushion than we normally would to make sure everything is working as it should
120679 these guys realize no matter how fast they get the project done if they dont do it correctly they dont get the next job
120680 well go along with the recommendation then after those two weeks are up see where everything stands i wouldnt rule out anything at this point
120681 im just hangin waiting to see if i survive my first trade deadline in three years

120693 i think people should have the right if they want to drink to be able to do it
120694 i think a significant amount of greenville residents believe this to be an economic development issue
120695 overall the city hasnt been able to recruit enough business into the area recruit enough jobs into the area one of those issues could be the fact that the city doesnt allow the sale of alcoholic beverages

120703 the deal that they developed countries would have got this time will not be same developing countries have realised that the world trade organization is biased towards the developed economies this was very much evident in the talks so when talks resume probably by mid 2009 developing countries will harden their stand countries like the united states are adept at taking everything on the table and giving little in return
120704 once when six of the seven countries wanted a cut of about 13 per cent in trade distorting farm subsidies the us said it was willing to commit only less than 15 per cent wto director general pascal lamy acknowledged the us stand technically it was argued that less than 15 per cent cut could mean 13 per cent but then it would have also meant just less than 15 per cent

120778 we are very content with the results for the second quarter where our core profits have risen by nearly 20 for the second consecutive quarter as a result of our strategy and the initiatives we have adopted since q4 2007 the bank has shown great resilience in a challenging market environment we have continued to successfully increase our core income and profits while at the same time focusing on several cost cutting initiatives we estimate that these co ordinated efforts will start to bear real fruit in the second half of the year during the first half we have successfully raised eur 2 4 bn in funding while paying outstanding maturities of eur 2 1 bn at the same time we have maintained a strong cad ratio of 11 2 despite a severe weakening of the isk we have also been successful in deleveraging our balance sheet the banks liquidity position remains strong at eur 8 1 bn at the end of the quarter the bank launched a new international deposit product save amp save in norway and iceland which will be expanded into other markets in due course looking forward we will continue to focus on our core operations leveraging on the banks niche strategy and the positive outlook for the global food and energy sectors where we have a strong market presence in our immediate plans we do not expect the wholesale funding markets to improve in the near future with our strong asset quality intact we will continue to manage our balance sheet further diversifying our funding sources and deleveraging non core assets

120787 our marketing strategy with fall release choke is to get all the chuck palahniuk fans in
120788 the problem is theres no real way to measure how big that base is
120789 sometimes that small group can be loyally fanatical and will never grow to the point of critical mass
120790 there are some shows youre never going to find profitability with no matter how much a fan base loves it
120791 the total number of people in the blog world is probably only a few hundred thousand and as much as they might hate to hear it for most movies thats not going to make the difference between a success and a failure
120792 why cant we share the wealth with these clubs and volunteer firehouses who use their money for charitable purposes

120800 but say it doesnt were still under a lot of pressure to get a park that is our own that isnt going to go away so my hope is that well find a way to make it happen it has not been as easy as i thought it would be
120801 to lew i think it seems like theyre delaying things
120802 in lews mind i think he thinks theyre not being entirely reasonable im not super worried but im concerned i think its important that we get the issues resolved so that we can move forward
120803 but the problem is we cant give them exactly what they want
120804 there is nothing drastic out of this audit like something horrible is happening
120805 but we need to know where every nickel is spent
120806 so many times you hear that vta is going bankrupt
120807 no were not going bankrupt were financially stable were moving in the right direction

120816 the doctors concluded that mr popal did not know the nature or consequences of his behavior
120817 this puts many projects on hold just when we were building a wind manufacturing infrastructure in this country
120818 its deeply disappointing and hard to fathom that congress cant get this done especially when 90 percent of congress supports this
120819 but the dynamic is different this year because of the presidential election
120820 we dont want to get swallowed up in the issues between the two parties
120821 she is saying we are going take no prisoners and try and beat this back before it qualifies
120822 there may well be people who think madison nguyen is not the right person but the time to make that decision is at the next election
120823 im very pleased with how well the obama people are getting their people out
120824 i have stood on stage with him in 22 debates but whos counting
120825 i have seen his passion and determination his grace and his grit his own life exemplifies the american dream
120826 but now it is time for us to unite and together stand up and say no more of the republican ideology
120827 i respect his many accomplishments my differences with him are not personal
120828 they are with the policies he has proposed because while he legitimately can tout moments of independence from his party in the past such independence isnt characteristic of his presidential campaign
120829 so she can partially forgive me for not supporting her losing candidate
120830 all of us are on the same team again everyone has worked hard on the clinton event

120838 i have a real one from italy and i knew there were no cane corso breeders in the nine county bay area

120840 made me run my shoes through a little bucket of clorox he said he didnt want his dogs to get infected from human bacteria the whole place was full of feces
120841 he kept telling me he was breeding the macho dog that would be more powerful than pit bulls and be great for dog fights or guide dogs
120842 from the outset i thought it was a little strange because he asked me to bring him dog food out of my pocket

120859 i am pleasantly surprised at the low number of times the officers used force
120860 we need to remember that the chief is doing this so he can see if there are areas to improve in
120861 he is doing that on his own initiative and i appreciate that
120862 this is the police department making its own best case and it is self serving and one sided as one would expect

120882 the whole place was packed with people trying to figure out how to get served
120883 go ahead were all getting laid off or minimum wage

120891 inquiries to date lead me to believe this incident was a case of mistaken identity
120892 it is vital that we trace this woman as soon as possible
120893 well ive depicted the sort of typical environment that bandicoots live in really
120894 im from tasmania where theyre still relatively plentiful i think here in south australia and in most other states in australia theyre getting quite scarce
120895 we have a lot of long term business in that sector but clearly we are benefiting from current operations in iraq and afghanistan
120896 im going to be working for the city of new york for the next 519 days so you dont have to worry about me being there
120897 i listened carefully to those who encouraged me to run but i am not and will not be a candidate for president
120898 the flawed elections in zimbabwe could set a negative precedent which could undermine democratic stability in the entire african continent
120899 we need countries to follow harmonized guidelines set out by regional leaders
120900 were being told the soviets are striving to achieve a comparatively low standard of living with ours but actually they have reached a basic stability in meeting their needs and are now planning to double their production
120901 alice came in as an independent she came in through the progressive movement the former chicago mayor harold washington coalition and she remained loyal to that progressive base throughout her political career
120902 she was a citizen of the world and she brought back a vast knowledge because of her travels
120903 she would always come back with progressive ideas to benefit the people of illinois global warming she was talking about it before the rest of us back when both of us were elected as democratic ward committeemen in 1989
120904 but the soviets do not link these issues with ruining the living standards of human beings
120905 the soviets are carrying out a policy to resolve inequalities between nationalities inequalities that they say were inherited from capitalist and czarist rule
120906 they have a comprehensive affirmative action program which they have stuck to religiously if i can use that word since 1917
120907 alice was a progressive and the type of person who felt like you had to talk to everybody around the world regardless of their political persuasion and i agree with her for the most part
120908 just because someone is from a different culture or a different political persuasion to say we wont talk with him is ridiculous
120909 power concedes nothing without a demand never has never will
120910 i dont remember her having any kind of imprint on any particularly legislation i dont have much memory of her having any signature bills or anything like that
120911 some people talked about that i think she would have made a great mayor but i dont think that was serious conversation back then
120912 i remember her as a reasoned voice and well thought of and well spoken
120913 when i served in the senate with her republicans were in control so those kinds of agendas were not part of our dialogue
120914 it hyde park is an extremely liberal part of chicago from my perspective i look at the perspective i have of sen obama in the senate certainly i would consider him to be very liberal so that does speak to the politics of that very area i suppose
120915 i plan to go to canada to learn first hand about the system and to look for ways we can adapt and improve it to meet illinois
120916 health care reform is of major concern of all americans i support the implementation of universal health care legislation based on the canadian system which provides health care services to all citizens
120917 that may have been something she saw in another country she did travel the world
120918 there were things she would see in another country doing better than us or in a different way thats effective why not bring it home to our citizens so she was way ahead of the curve on universal health care and climate change
120919 all of us were outraged by the decision and we felt that we needed to go on record and challenge the u s justice department to pursue whether rodney kings civil rights were violated with as much enthusiasm as they are following what happened with the white truck driver
120920 were concerned about government ethics and reformed election reform and civil liberties in criminal justice
120921 we are opposed to capital punishment we were supportive of the gay rights bill that was up and controversial around that time 1995 in illinois were pro abortion rights we favor progressive taxes
120922 i liked alice palmer a lot i thought she was a good public servant it was very awkward that part of it i wish had played out entirely different
120923 she tapped obama to run and he went out and got petitions and the like and she after losing the primary she flipped changed her mind
120924 i dont think she had a lot of sympathy from democrats having chosen her successor have him go out and work hard to get on the ballot and then all of a sudden she changes her mind and wants her spot back
120925 im just happy to be able to come here and meet the president and just see our nations capital
120926 and im really glad the president could take time out of his busy schedule to say hi and spend time with us
120927 i think i speak for all the scouts and probably all the leaders too when i say were really glad we could be here but we just wish that all of us could be here
120928 some have referred to our scouts as heroes and in our hearts we know they are
120929 but what is so remarkable is that they were doing what they were trained and prepared to do they were doing what comes naturally to a scout
120930 the fact is that the war on terror is in afghanistan we need more resources there that was clear from the day we left our full attention from afghanistan and moved onto iraq so i do think that its essential that we win the war in afghanistan
120931 we are understaffed there not only in our military presence but also in terms of the reconstruction of afghanistan so the benefits of the democratic government are more clearly presented to the people of afghanistan
120932 yes the bottom line is i think obamas trip was brilliant not in the short term but in the long term because its changed the whole debate and the whole debate now is focused on afghanistan more than on iraq
120933 as obama has said we need more troops in afghanistan and that all of our troops are tied up in iraq sends a clear message that our priorities are not in order
120934 we will start with shrimp cocktail and a light german wine
120935 if your net income tax liability net income tax liability is tax before credits including the alternative minimum tax less all nonrefundable credits other than the allowable child tax credit like i didnt know that is at least 3 000 your stimulus payment is your net income tax liability up to 600 or 1 200 for joint filers however generally your stimulus payment will not be less than 300 600 for joint filers

120939 indeed i did have a relationship with miss lewinsky that was not appropriate
120940 in fact it was wrong it constituted a critical lapse in judgment and a personal failure on my part for which i am solely and completely responsible
120941 around 90 of the people who purchase mp3s from amazon continue reading
120942 but say it doesnt were still under a lot of pressure to get a park that is our own that isnt going to go away so my hope is that well find a way to make it happen it has not been as easy as i thought it would be
120943 to lew i think it seems like theyre delaying things
120944 in lews mind i think he thinks theyre not being entirely reasonable im not super worried but im concerned i think its important that we get the issues resolved so that we can move forward
120945 but the problem is we cant give them exactly what they want

121024 what was going through her head while she was flipping around
121025 i tried to make this a boy version but im just too
121026 weve got theories weve been talking to police and experts in all different fields
121027 the difficulty is every theory ends up in a dead end or a point where it becomes ridiculous and theres no sort of factual information to back up you know to make that theory have any substance and thats the difficulty of the whole thing
121028 the family are still doing things very tough a day doesnt go by where its not spoken about and looked at
121029 were hoping that the inquest will drive out that information that the authorities have got or the possibility that other people that havent come forward yet will come forward with something that we can use
121030 the overwhelming support and help weve had through this would indicate that people would do everything they could to help but if theres a sinister side to it someone might be sitting on something that they know or saw
121031 ultimately that would be the best outcome out of the whole lot

121039 this is not a condition that kills you acutely it is a condition that erodes your health over time
121040 have been sleep deprived for perhaps very long periods of time they are struggling to sleep if this is happening night after night week after week on top of all our other schedules this is a dangerous recipe
121041 when you stop breathing in your sleep you dont know it it doesnt typically wake you up
121042 our findings along with those from the wisconsin cohort remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
121043 it is likely that our findings may underestimate the mortality risk of sdb in other ethnic groups or the lowest socio economic strata where there is poor awareness and access to health care
121044 our findings indicate that the initial hospital costs associated with penetrating trauma are substantial and vary to a considerable degree by patient injury and treatment characteristics
121045 although the costs of penetrating trauma resulting from shooting are higher than from stabbing the most commonly used weapon in violent crime in england and wales is actually a knife
121046 at an average cost of 7 699 per penetrating injury from alleged assault and a total of 417 injuries per year requiring hospitalisation for at least three days the total acute care cost of this type of injury alone may exceed 3 2 million annually
121047 public health initiatives that aim to reduce the incidence and severity of penetrating trauma are therefore likely to produce significant savings in acute trauma care costs
121048 considering the additional medical costs of rehabilitation and broader costs to society resulting from lost productivity permanent disability premature death and the pain and suffering of the victims and their families there is a compelling argument for money to be better spent on prevention strategies that reduce violent incidents
121049 it should be borne in mind that most of the cost of trauma especially stabbing is not to the health service but in billions per annum to the taxpayer through legal costs loss of productive tax paying years in those that die or are severely disabled and in long term care
121050 organizations like the kenneth b schwartz center are an important tool in the fight against cancer as they help create better relationships between caregivers and patients by doing things like improving communication and helping caregivers be more emotionally present for their patients
121051 our mission is to support and enhance the patient caregiver relationship and much of our work takes place at cancer centers around the country so we are thrilled to be part of its survivor circle exhibit
121052 substance abuse varies significantly depending upon the purpose for which these are used for example 28 6 of those drinking alcohol do so to help them get to know a potential sexual partner while 26 2 of those using cocaine take it to make sexual intercourse last longer
121053 those who consume alcohol cannabis cocaine or ecstasy under the age of 16 are likely to have had sexual relations before this age too
121054 the current patterns of drug use among the study participants reflect their number of sexual partners with regular cocaine users in comparison with those who have never taken it being five times more likely to have had five or more sexual partners within the last 12 months or to have paid for sex
121055 prevention experts must be aware of how young people view the relationship between drug use and sexuality there are very few preventive programmes in our country that take this link into consideration
121056 now that we are aware of this link and the associated health risks new programmes and preventive strategies will be needed in addition to further research in the area of drug use and its social psychological and physical links to sexuality based on the real and important experiences of young people themselves
121057 giving comprehensible and appropriate information about survival benefit is extremely difficult in addition the reluctance to inform patients of the limited survival gain of palliative chemotherapy may be motivated by a desire to protect patients from bad news
121058 however the reluctance to address these difficulties and sensitivities may be hampering patients ability to make informed decisions about their future treatment

121097 this job gives me the opportunity to talk about my dad every day when someone is grieving the loss of a loved one they spent 65 years with i tell them they are blessed you had them for 65 years and i only had my dad for ten
121098 i think its interesting they served their country and then served science so that makes them unique here

121104 mit ausnahme der grundschulen wird es zu beginn des schuljahres an den allgemeinbildenden und berufsbildenden schulen in rheinland pfalz zu teilweise erheblichen engp ssen und zu strukturellem unterrichtsausfall zwischen 3 und 6 kommen
121105 in fast allen schularten gibt es nicht mehr gen gend bewerberinnen und bewerber um die vorhandenen planstellen besetzen zu k nnen
121106 zurzeit suchen die einstellungsbeh rden h nderingend nach lehrerinnen und lehren um die l cher zu stopfen vor allem durch den abschluss von vertretungsvertr gen weil es f r die planstellen niemand mit der angeforderten f cherkombination mehr gibt
121107 wir kritisieren diese verschiebeaktion schon deswegen weil die abgeordneten an den schulen ihrer schulart auch ben tigt werden
121108 das ministerium errechnet statistisch einen lehrkr fte berhang den es so gar nicht gibt weil es bei seiner berechnung des lehrerbedarfs die klassenmesszahl und nicht die tats chlichen klassengr en zugrunde legt
121109 dass alle im haushalt zur verf gung stehenden planstellen in diesen schularten noch besetzt werden k nnen die gew fordert aber mehr planstellen f r notwendige p dagogische arbeit an den grundschulen z b f r individuelle f rderung und differenzierung und eine vertretungsreserve f r alle schularten in grundschulklassen mit zum teil bis zu 30 kindern ist die f rderung einzelner kaum m glich
121110 wir bersehen nicht dass das bildungsministerium in den vergangenen jahren mehr personen zum referendariat zugelassen hat als noch vor zehn jahren
121111 wir verstehen aber nicht und kritisieren deswegen immer wieder warum trotz des real drohenden lehrerinnen und lehrermangels nicht alle geeigneten bewerberinnen und bewerber in den studienseminaren zugelassen wurden und werden wenn hier kein schnelles und rigoroses umdenken erfolgt werden wir trotz zur ckgehender sch lerzahlen in f nf bis zehn jahren ganz schwierige verh ltnisse haben
121112 die gew fordert die landesregierung auf die besoldung ihrer landesbeamtinnen und beamten an das bundesweite niveau heranzuf hren und die verbeamtungsgrenze im schulbereich wieder auf mindestens 45 jahre anzuheben
121113 die herabsetzung der altersgrenze durch eine verf gung des finanzministers auf 40 jahre ist zumindest im schulbereich ein kontraproduktiv die folgen m ssen nun die betroffenen kolleginnen und kollegen und in zunehmendem ma e auch die sch lerinnen und sch ler in rheinland pfalz ausbaden
121114 mit seiner informationspolitik auf der eigenen homepage diskriminiert das ministerium die arbeit tausender engagierter hauptschullehrerinnen
121115 oder wie soll der hinweis dass f r realschule plus die lehrbef higungen an berufsbildenden
121116 betrachtet man die immer noch karge empirische grundlage insgesamt so sind die daten zu widerspr chlich ihre m glichen deutungen zu vielf ltig
121117 mehr baf g f r mehr studierende das ist ein sehr gutes signal an alle jungen menschen in deutschland
121118 ein starkes baf g ist ein starkes argument f r ein studium und es ist das beste mittel f r mehr chancengleichheit in unserem hochschulsystem
121119 es ist gut dass die bundesregierung den weg frei machen will f r eine leichtere zuwanderung ausl ndischer fachkr fte mit den 190 000 ausl ndischen studierenden haben wir allerdings viele der h nderingend gesuchten fachkr fte bereits im land

121141 as sick as she is shes involved she does a lot more stuff with her kids than ive seen a lot of parents do
121142 i dont know how but the adversity makes her stronger
121143 she is completely devoted to her children and she does not let her illness keep her from what a mother needs to do
121144 i want them to have a good time and to remember it
121145 thats one of the many questions we have to answer
121146 it also affects the buyback price because if we cannot sell it back to the students then obviously we cant pay them as much

121152 wettelijk mogen jobstudenten geen werken uitvoeren die als gevaarlijk en of ongezond worden beschouwd daar valt ook het oppompen van vrachtwagenband onder
121153 als er risicos aan verbonden zijn adviseren we altijd om zon werk niet aan te nemen of op te stappen
121154 het oppompen van vrachtwagenbanden moet in ons land verplicht in een veiligheidskooi gebeuren maar de arbeidsinspectie is daar bijzonder laks in en controleert die procedure nauwelijks daardoor zijn er garages die het niet zo nauw nemen omdat dit tijdverlies betekent
121155 bij een bandexplosie word je met een enorme kracht weggeslingerd ik ken heel wat gevallen waarbij mensen een hand of arm verloren het fatale ongeval met de student had dus perfect kunnen voorkomen worden
121156 de arbeidsongevallenverzekering van de werkgever komt wel tussenbeide in zon gevallen in het geval van kasterlee zullen ouders en zussen of broers vergoed worden en is er ook een tussenkomst voorzien in de begrafeniskosten
121157 de band waar ben aan moest werken was de dag voordien al door andere werknemers bij autobanden sooi opgepompt

121178 were continuing to move mario around to both sides mario is not improving the way wed like him to so well just continue to push him but its not close right now
121179 thats just our belief in trying to suit only seven linemen
121180 it gets you one more special teams player at another position to be able to suit up on game day if you go to eight usually a linemans not really valuable on special teams and youre losing a core guy you want on special teams to help you thats why were training them now so when the game happens guys are able to play two positions
121181 you can see a little bit of velocity issue with him right now different from normal that will go away here pretty soon
121182 im just trying to protect myself as much as i can
121183 i just wanted to get out here just so i could get back in practice i dont really like sitting out and watching guys bust their behinds when i can be out there doing something
121184 it wasnt really all arm i just hitch my wrist and got my body into it it didnt really take much
121185 hes such an explosive player that its something we have to look at
121186 part of that will be determined by how the other returners do
121187 if you have a great return situation to put darren out there that may not be worth it
121188 if were struggling then it becomes more valuable to us lets say theres a difference in average of 10 yards then its valuable
121189 i returned kicks in college so coach is always telling me to go over and just work on kick returns

121251 barack obama has played the and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
121252 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
121253 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
121254 she victoria is hot funny and lets not forget her success with the spice girls
121255 she has not been approached but the beckham boys are big fans of high school musical

121260 the rugby cranes have expressed a need to have some of their training expenses met directly
121261 the idea was basically to avoid media pressures and other factors what is clear is that he mulindwa will be in dar es salaam for the deal
121262 that was the first time i saw the boys play almost perfect rugby
121263 it was smooth the passing was divine it was as close you get to perfect as you can i think that was the time that rugby in uganda stopped being full of potential as everybody would say and actually at a different level all the wins after that were almost just routine
121264 like so many times nobody gave the boys a chance
121265 we had about three injuries and zimbabwe was full of confidence but we went out and took them down they couldnt believe it that time i saw the fighting spirit of the rugby cranes and i knew we had a great future
121266 it was the first time uganda beat kenya at home weve always had this rivalry with kenya and they came pumped up and full of confidence but we wiped those smiles off their faces and to rub it in we went to nairobi and also beat them there i will never forget that game where robert seguya kicked in all his conversions and most of the players today were just reaching their peak
121267 its a fight that we have been anticipating for long and the opposition is very strong
121268 it would be a big boost for semo if he wins this fight because we are planning to have him fight for the wbc i title against a south african pugilist
121269 the fact that they zimbabwe have not played a competitive match because of the indefinite postponement of their match against senegal should give us a slight edge over their level of match fitness

121290 i know that im endangering my life and am even liable to lose my father but i hope that hell understand this and that god will give him and my family patience and willingness to open their eyes to jesus and to christianity maybe one day ill be able to return to palestine and to ramallah with jesus in the kingdom of god
121291 send regards to israel i miss it i respect israel and admire it as a country
121292 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death
121293 its still early but certainly we are pleased by where were at at this stage of the campaign
121294 if we had more money to give them we would
121295 we want to keep marriage defined as one man and one woman throughout the nation
121296 i think we have to spend more than they do
121297 i dont think we have to spend a lot more but i think we have to spend more than they do and were completely capable of raising that
121298 at 12 10am on wednesday we received a third party allegation that a photographer had been spat at by an individual outside a restaurant in hanway street w1
121299 officers established the incident occurred at approximately 10 20pm on tuesday evening
121300 the alleged suspect a 22 year old male was spoken to by police
121301 my husband makes a decent living but to live in santa clara valley it takes over 100 000
121302 we have all worked extremely hard to meet our commitment to commence production of the mg tf in august we are delighted to have reached this important point and are looking forward to seeing the cars in showrooms shortly
121303 the launch of this car also marks the re introduction of the mg brand to the uk existing mg owners our huge band of enthusiasts and fans of the authentic sports car driving experience have looked forward to this day for a long time
121304 our state faces a looming cash crisis this situation leaves me with no easy choices
121305 this is not an action that i take lightly i understand that this will affect people at a time when they are already struggling and so i want to apologize to all the state employees for having to do that
121306 the whole place was packed with people trying to figure out how to get served
121307 go ahead were all getting laid off or minimum wage
121308 our workers have received mixed messages from their supervisors about which employees will be exempt and which employees will not be exempt
121309 he cant force us to do anything different than were already doing
121310 he is under pressure and were all under pressure thats why i dont understand why this distraction was needed
121311 shes in the ladies bowling league honey we share lanes with them
121312 the main driver behind fare increases will be the high oil price its very clear that the industry is going to have to reflect this high price
121313 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
121314 fuel prices have doubled in the past year a successful hedging programme mitigated the impact but nevertheless fuel costs at 706 million were up 233 million in the quarter
121315 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date
121316 but say it doesnt were still under a lot of pressure to get a park that is our own that isnt going to go away so my hope is that well find a way to make it happen it has not been as easy as i thought it would be
121317 to lew i think it seems like theyre delaying things
121318 in lews mind i think he thinks theyre not being entirely reasonable im not super worried but im concerned i think its important that we get the issues resolved so that we can move forward
121319 but the problem is we cant give them exactly what they want
121320 i am one of the few fans who aside from season ticket holders have attended at least eight games this year
121321 i can no longer do that the rest of this year not when i am watching a minor league team or a group of players who are boring and simply unwatchable i want to attend games but i need more than root beer to do so
121322 but we decided to spend more than we normally would to add or keep our best players
121323 were trying to win every game but there comes a time when youve got to decide where your team is going to be in a few years and general manager billy beane has done his job in identifying where we are now and where we want to be
121324 i dont think its fan apathy as much as the market has been established
121325 we made a real fight for the playoffs in 2006 and in 2007 the fan interest was no greater it says to me that our fan market isnt elastic
121326 we cant have aging players and keep them just because the fans would like to see them here
121327 after 10 months of sommerers supervision there was still no school no medical care and danieal was dead
121328 what was in essence a forgery fest in her office
121329 her horrifying condition had to be obvious to anyone who saw her for a second
121330 was a failure of institutional inclination saving danieal was just too much trouble
121331 critically important to prosecute those responsible for a childs death
121332 errors are covered up or hidden under a cloak of professed confidentiality
121333 simply knowing that others are watching and that dereliction will be exposed might cause employees to be more careful in the first place
121334 supervisors must move beyond merely counting numbers of visits or pieces of paper in a file although those are important as a bare minimum
121335 it needs to judge its own performance and that of its workers and contractors based on the achievement of goals set for individual families
121336 it is equally important to systematically reform the organization otherwise it is only a matter of time before the next such tragedy occurs
121337 how did danieal become this emaciated corpse in this morgue photo
121338 ought to take it over and exercise stricter control not give a provisional license again and again
121339 certainly the findings in that report indicate everything that dhs doesnt stand for
121340 there are a lot of pieces to the reform and i think one of the questions we will ask is just that question
121341 we are certainly going to monitor the situation but the governor believes that the new administration and the new leadership at the agency deserve an opportunity to straighten things out
121342 we recognize that todays developments will take us one step further in the pursuit of justice for danieal kelly we are more determined than ever to make the changes necessary to ensuring that such a case does not happen again
121343 epa has determined that pcbs are toxic and persistent pcbs can enter the body through the lungs gastrointestinal tract and skin can circulate throughout the body and can be stored in the fatty tissue
121344 cannot comment on real estate transactions that are not completed
121345 it involves damage to property that is vital to our military any action that delays delivery of materiel or that endangers the integrity of army aircraft affects the safety of the men and women who are serving our country and will not be tolerated
121346 fortunately this senseless act of vandalism was discovered quickly and no physical harm occurred to personnel as a result
121347 however the potential threat to safety from such acts is serious and therefore such cases must be aggressively investigated and prosecuted
121348 i thought it was a gun i was scared i didnt know if it was real or fake i didnt know
121349 since i had the gun in my hand i pulled the trigger
121350 some kid down on 2nd street had gave it to me
121351 i would rather it be in the car than on the street
121352 youre saying after he was shot tykeem law was trying to move on his bike
121353 is there any possible explanation why anyone in your car didnt
121354 aint that what i said a couple of times sir
121355 because my client was the only one to see tykeem put his hand under his black t shirt doesnt mean it didnt happen
121356 tykeem throws down his bicycle walks to the passenger side of the mazda and does this
121357 who among us would not have thought he had a gun
121358 tykeem law was not armed and did not have anything on his person that could be considered a weapon
121359 could this defendant have retreated what was in front of him when tykeem moved aside nothing
121360 point that at the most vital area of the human body
121361 he decided to kill that boy for no reason at all
121362 om aan voldoende hulp te komen beginnen we steeds vroeger met de werving maar het kost steeds meer moeite om het rooster rond te krijgen
121363 er zijn vakantiebaantjes die beter worden betaald de zorg is nu eenmaal geen rijke sector laatst zag ik een folder van een thuiszorgorganisatie die i pods weggaf om vakantiekrachten aan te trekken dat zouden wij ook wel willen maar daarvoor hebben we het geld niet toch denk ik dat ook wij in de toekomst meer creativiteit aan de dag moeten leggen bij het werven van vakantiekrachten maar ik heb nog geen idee hoe we dat gaan doen
121364 the floor person says to me youre emanating an odor but you can go eat at the buffet and well pay for it
121365 how could they possibly say that to me i said hey buddy if youre going to give me a free meal how about bobby flays or seablue dont send me to the trough like a pig theyre discriminating against me because im obese
121366 he told me to go up to my room and take a shower
121367 i was pristine when i came in it wasnt like i was working on a garbage truck and just walked in i wasnt a rose but i didnt smell like a skunk
121368 ive always been treated decently there but this was right out of left field
121369 they could have handled this in a much more businesslike manner
121370 he was a very violent individual who needed to be off the street
121371 hes lying straight out when he says this is going to benefit gas prices
121372 the american people will be the beneficiaries of obamas energy plan
121373 weve been using all means necessary to fight for whats right for america and the environment
121374 a lot of people are interested they just dont see the truth on television
121375 the current situation in the west bank is similar to that in the gaza strip before hamas took control security forces are committing crimes in their interrogation and torture centers
121376 its not as good as wed like it to be but i want to remind you a few months ago there were predictions that the economy would shrink this quarter
121377 were hoping people come out on saturday and take the initiative to become responsible adults parents and children
121378 it really is just a group of individuals and community groups that came together knowing that violence was out of hand
121379 we are going to make people aware and help them step up in creating and maintaining a violence free community
121380 the west oak lane site and south philly are participating for the first time
121381 they can volunteer in the school system or become big brothers or big sisters
121382 ongoing guidance at least in the first 10 years is of the utmost importance
121383 my husband and i have been married three and a half years
121384 but i can definitely say despite a very happy marriage we need lots of support and guidance all young married couples need guidance because it is hard and guidance from a priest or from another more experienced couple can really help you persevere
121385 in marriage two people meld two lives into one and we need as much prayer and support as we can get it is important to hear over and over again that the most joy will come from what seems the most challenging giving yourself for your spouse and for your children
121386 the last thing i want to do is be a distraction here in the administration
121387 i think public service is important and i have really enjoyed what ive done
121388 if i decide to run and im the only contributor to my campaign i think id take that as a vote of no confidence from the rest of the voters
121389 he knows he shouldnt turn his back on the political establishment either
121390 he was a popular governor and nobody hates him people who are undecided might like to see somebody from their state get in
121391 they spend a lot of time focusing on themselves instead of the voters
121392 i say they should lower the jolly roger and raise the stars and stripes harrisburg needs an enema
121393 the olympiad cycle was a very simple four year cycle and you dont need a sophisticated instrument like this to calculate it it took us by huge surprise when we saw this
121394 but the games were of such cultural and social importance that its not unnatural to have it in the mechanism
121395 why cant we share the wealth with these clubs and volunteer firehouses who use their money for charitable purposes
121396 we would charge a licensing fee of 1 000 for each machine up to five per club theyd be hard wired so wed be able to monitor each bet
121397 you think the gaming board and casino operators are going to let anyone in on their play
121398 revel is mourning the loss of several of its team members
121399 the design team was heading to minnesota for a glass manufacturing meeting
121400 theres a good chance some of them are gone unfortunately
121401 zum ersten mal bieten wir eine seminarreihe an die einen umfassenden einblick in die gro e bandbreite der public relations gibt
121402 das angebot der sommer school reicht von einem bewerbungsseminar ber ein rhetorik und schreibworkshop bis hin zur krisen pr und dem richtigen umgang mit ger chten

121404 rhetorik und pr sentation stehen bestehen und berzeugen vor publikum
121405 this was a big game for us and we knew we had to put daylight between ourselves and halifax
121406 we also knew it was important to stop halifax picking up a bonus point we simply had to hang in there
121407 we know have a seven point cushion and there is a lot of competition for places within the side we have our nose in front and we just have to keep on pressing because there is a lot to play for
121408 thats all i can tell you we were the underdogs but we showed them we can play together
121409 its kind of a bummer to have her sitting out
121410 this league is about getting better and i wish she couldve been there
121411 as much as i wanted to play i thought i should rest it
121412 it wouldve been a harder game with kristi but we dont want her to get injured
121413 we looked out for each other it was a blast
121414 i was just lucky i was hoping none of the other coaches would take her
121415 when i got her i thought were going to win well take our lumps in the regular season but when jaime is there for the playoffs watch out
121416 with us being the number four seed it was nice to come out and win a few games
121417 not everybody has that opportunity to go back to their hometown and work with something they love to do and their passion
121418 for me to go back to a facility where the courts are named after him its even extra special
121419 my charge is to grow the game of tennis bring some new people into the game run events and do that kind of thing
121420 i will do some teaching myself but i will also hire some staff in addition ill oversee the fitness area and also be renting out the turf area and scheduling the turf area
121421 its a nice blend for me because it gives me some new challenges but yet will draft on the skills that i have and the things that i enjoy
121422 as much as im looking forward to heading back to iowa city i feel like its the right thing to do but these past couple days have been very very emotional
121423 matthews one of those guys that plays in many positions hes played on glass a lot over many years that may happen again harvey said
121424 it will be intriguing the matchups and who goes through the midfield on sunday
121425 shaun would just like the guys to play the way he does harvey said
121426 i hope the games spirited confrontational at times and its last man standing thats what i hope and thats what ill talk to them about
121427 well acknowledge shaun after the game in the best possible way we can worsfold said
121428 seemed like a good idea at the time but am thinking about moving over to the prius very seriously right now
121429 there is nothing drastic out of this audit like something horrible is happening
121430 but we need to know where every nickel is spent
121431 so many times you hear that vta is going bankrupt
121432 no were not going bankrupt were financially stable were moving in the right direction
121433 i always felt the revenue projections were so loose they would flop around and were tied to the political environment you cannot allow that to happen and have the public trust you
121434 i thought you said you were chrysler 300c amp 300c touring dodge caliber jeep compass amp grand cherokee amp commander amp cherokee amp wrangler abs anti lock brake system recall
121435 rising fuel prices have definitely accelerated demand for fuel efficient four cylinder cars
121436 however families and other suv buyers are focused on requirements such as space comfort performance and reliability as well as fuel efficiency
121437 we have retrofitted our avti digital advertising signage hardware software into multiple coca cola vending systems located at laguna hills shopping mall in laguna hills california for the initial stage of a multi phase southern california base pilot program with coke this is creating an opportunity for coca cola to be part of type of network that it is so familiar with branding and disseminating information

121439 its one of those names you hate when youre growing up
121440 we both came into the profession in the 80s when there was a generation of young lawyers concerned about miscarriages of justice and making the law more accessible not speaking arcane language that no one could understand you would not find keir customarily in wing collar and stripy trousers
121441 traditionally the police have had their hands on the prosecution of cases and that has to change it has to be more of a partnership with the prosecuting lawyer following the case through taking the ultimate decisions prosecutors have an ethical obligation to decide in the public interest there is no incongruity that someone who has been a defence lawyer should know best how to look at a case from the other side
121442 whenever one of us left home they replaced us with a donkey
121443 i had the idea of changing things for the better i was always interested in constitutional issues and politics i thought id become a solicitor but then the idea of actually presenting an argument being the person who got up in court began to appeal
121444 he has fantastic leadership qualities and you dont get to be head of chambers without being well liked by your colleagues he has an ability to motivate and he is not easily cowed if there is a row with the government he will certainly fight his corner
121445 i gave him a copy of kafkas the trial today and said he should read it every year he says he already knows it backwards
121446 beh hai una bella ragazza la famiglia e gli amici nn hai tempo da perdere dietro i brutti ricordi goditi la tua nuova vita

121490 go placidly amid the noise and haste and remember what peace there may be in silence
121491 nick robinsons blog is a detailed and thorough analysis of whether a new chancellor is needed and worth reading for that
121492 i agree with nick robinson that as journalists we will be sorry to see mr bush go he gives great quote
121493 nick robinson has an interesting take on why it david davis resignation may be bad for the conservatives
121494 nick robinson reports on a flurry of interest in jacqui smith as prime minister and the picture he paints is quite convincing
121495 thats it im off on my hols rarely have i gone away so uncertain what the next few months will
121496 depending on your view of the intrinsic value of british energy invesco and the pru are either heroes or villains
121497 china never announces the unblocking of websites so you have to click around every day to see which sites are
121498 this year we have decided that birthdays will be celebrated by decorating the desks of students rather than by parent provided snacks
121499 then with magic companies start make money they cut how you say fat
121500 and stock go up and they get more money to grow
121501 well maria the markets up because there were more buyers than sellers
121502 the crowds are smaller at cocktail parties the aura is stained but there still is the letter b as in billionaire next to their name
121503 they may still have halls named after them at universities but the idea that these guys are the kings of investing that time has passed
121504 as persuasive as kesslers arguments may sound the hard evidence proves otherwise average returns on older firms surpassed the returns on the newer firms technology stocks which pay the lowest dividends have scarcely been market beaters
121505 more money has been lost chasing yield than has been lost at the point of a gun
121506 anyone who makes investing decisions based on one year results is just being silly
121507 by acting on his advice i estimate it will take two years if im lucky to get even
121508 we need a little more sanity in a period in which everyone feels invincible
121509 what does everyone out there think today hmm oil up 2 because of rigged nigerian elections and venezuelan nationalizations others think it will spill over but theyre being too emotional no way its worth 2 ill take the other side of that trade
121510 nyses neutron bomb strategy of removing people and leaving the exchange intact is progressing with a publicly traded stock and the protection from the trade through rule theyll soon put their own capital up and profit almost every time someone else trades
121511 i just figured ok we could just throw one together and that would help people create a page
121512 within two weeks two thirds of the school had signed up
121513 i just told my roommates and it kinda spread from there by the end of sophomore year it had expanded to about 30 colleges
121514 for the final exam we had to learn the historical significance of something like 500 pieces of art from that period having not really read that stuff i was in a lot of trouble spending my time building facebook instead of studying
121515 by taking the understanding that all the individuals have and pooling that knowledge together you get a better set of knowledge
121516 thats kind of what we are doing here but with whats going on in the world with these people that i care about
121517 and the people that are their confirmed friends around facebook
121518 the power here is that people have information they dont want to share with everyone if you give people very tight control over what information they are sharing or who they are sharing with
121519 they will actually share more one example is that one third of our users share their cell phone number on the site
121520 but really what i care about is giving people access to connect and the information they want as efficiently as possible
121521 before newsfeed basically you had to go and you kind of look at peoples profiles you wanted to check up on but there was nothing to tell you what was the most interesting stuff now as soon as they log in people get a sense of what is going on in their world more efficiently
121522 when we launched newsfeed someone made a group students against newsfeed and people started joining it and this trend was mounting and every single persons newsfeed had a story that said man all these people are joining students against newsfeed a lot of companies probably would have altered the code to block that from propagating and we probably could have but we have this focus on openness so we felt like no thats not the right thing to do its kind of like journalistic integrity
121523 i would hear man early on i was freaked by newsfeed and now i dont know how i can live without it we want to build good things and thats the cost of doing it the net effect was really positive
121524 actually i dont have a tv but i do read newspapers but how i read them is important i dont pick up a physical get sent a link the experience is very different given to me by different people what my friends sent to me or what other people think and send to me
121525 in the next iterations youre going to see real stories being produced these people went to this party and they did this the next day and then heres the discussion that was taking place off of this article in the wall street journal and these two people went to this party and they broke up the next day whatever you can start weaving together real events into stories as these start to approach being stories we turn into a massive publisher twenty to 30 snippets of information or stories a day thats like 300 million stories a day it gets to a point where we are publishing more in a day than most other publications have in the history of their whole existence
121526 as information is available that really affects how people think about the world how people think about and absorb things democracy at a really high level its both an ideal in the abstract that we fight for and work toward as part of our mission but its also a practical value inside the company we place a really high value on being able to talk about a lot of things anything
121527 it just took a certain amount of people getting in trouble and then they learned we need to give people tools to share whatever information they want
121528 but really what i care about is giving people access to connect and the information they want as efficiently as possible
121529 you should have access to the information others want to share
121530 this is all in response to comcast trying to kill off pirates arrgghh
121531 this is all in response to comcast trying very unsuccessfully to kill off pirates at the same time they severely inconvenienced their customers who often have no other solution to turn to
121532 with net neutrality there will be no new competition and no incentives for build outs bandwidth speeds will stagnate and new services will wither from bandwidth starvation
121533 municipal or privately run wireless data services using wi fi or wimax should be sprouting like weeds but they arent being built because of lack of access to street lights of all things to set up access points
121534 yet despite an overabundance of bandwidth pulsing throughout the u s we are still stuck with rationing to our homes havent we learned that advancing technology is never served by arbitrary rules to divvy up scarce resources
121535 the internet will only expand based on competitive principles not socialist diktat
121536 cable modems work by taking away a tv channel or two and using them for data at 59 per month for 4 5 megabits per second and 69 for 8 meg while 100 meg in japan is 30 month
121537 japan has surged ahead of the united states on the wings of better wire and more aggressive government regulation industry analysts say
121538 comcast cant block google or a whole google sub service
121539 if you had the choice of paying 3x more for being able to download something in 2 hours instead of 6 hours while all other services stay the same would you
121540 i personally would climb telephone poles on my street to run fiber if i could get 100 megabit internet service
121541 i have no problem with comcast cutting back bittorrent or anything else as long as i know about it and i have a choice to go elsewhere with my business
121542 entertaining a smart aleck tour of academic labs where kessler says the future is being invented think
121543 a strong case for a digital revolution in medicines approach to diagnostics
121544 a captivating eminently readable narrative built around his personal quest to determine if anything makes sense in the 1 8 trillion system kessler packages all of this in addictively short thriller like chapters woven with a breezy nouveau gonzo style
121545 nope theyre all trying to hit fish with a baseball bat
121546 true so what is it balance sheet partners their logo
121547 you just play the trials i dont give a shit what drug it is it almost always works the same way
121548 a team of systems engineers from the university of sheffield uk is developing an intelligent computer system which imitates a doctors brain to make treatment decisions for intensive care patients
121549 this new system not only monitors and treats critical patients but it can also learn from the experiences of medical staff who can override the machine at any time if overridden the system assimilates the doctors input and uses the new information to make decisions about similar cases in the future
121550 what is your advice to physicians on adapting to this brave new world
121551 health savings accounts are being touted as a way to control costs and i very much doubt that claim
121552 more likely than those with traditional medical coverage to have difficulty paying their medical bills 49 of consumers with deductibles above 500 per year wound up with outstanding medical debt vs 32 with regular coverage
121553 microsoft chief executive steve ballmer says health is a hot market for technology and the company is likely to be in the market for a few healthcare related software companies
121554 yeah double e worked on wall street for a bit too long
121555 i figured that howd you get into funding medical research
121556 my dad survived colon cancer my mom died from ovarian cancer
121557 ovarian cancer is known as the silent killer its asymptomatic most doctors diagnose a bladder infection and prescribe antibiotics it spreads fast you cant even see it on scanners its soft tissue on soft tissue kind of blends in i figured there had to be some way to detect it early
121558 anyway i left cisco in 2000 had to sell the options at well you remember what it was like then but i set up a foundation and figured i could take an active role
121559 but how isnt most research segmented into silos islands funnels whatever
121560 look youve been in silicon valley for a while right stuff happens technology spreads people share information you motivate people and they break down old ways of doing things
121561 not much of that in medicine the fda is like the fcc big pharma like the regional bells
121562 were just missing entrepreneurs and open standards to get things going i started canary fund to see if i could create an open platform for early detection i work with stanford and usf and the hutch its just not there yet
121563 tell me about this canary fund its a venture fund and what is the hutch
121564 no no lets see if i can explain in the fall of 2003 i gave 10 million through a family trust to the fred hutchinson cancer research center up in seattle to focus on early detection i also joined the board to make sure it happened theyre the largest u s funded cancer center something like 300 million
121565 fred hutchinson was a baseball player who died young and his brother was a doctor that helped set the place up in his name
121566 theyre not as famous as m d anderson or sloan kettering but they do some important stuff its just that none of these places spend much on early detection
121567 lots of reason politics too hard not glamorous who knows
121568 the key are these biomarkers you know what they are
121569 something that you can identify in your blood or urine that points to some type of cancer being present over simplifying each tumor will express a unique protein and if you can test for that protein you may have a biomarker
121570 not even close there even is a biomarker for ovarian cancer called ca 125 its 80 effective meaning 20 false negatives let me say that again it means that 20 of women who actually have ovarian cancer are told they dont with ca 125
121571 yeah pretty much none of them are all that good thats why i am funding this work to not only find biomarkers but to create a platform so that others can more easily identify new biomarkers then medicine gets turned completely around
121572 look to get biomarkers to be real you have to have both specificity and sensitivity picking up just on one protein and not missing it but there are millions of proteins we probably know about 5000 of them im funding a bioinformatics platform to hold all this protein info its amazing no one has done this yet ive got a bunch of ex microsofters writing code
121573 you are probably used to thinking of eight inch wafers and billion fabs cranking out microprocessors forget all that think mass spectrometers one protein at a time often a protein whose quantity is eight orders of magnitude lower then other stuff in your blood its not easy at all its a couple of gigabytes of data out of the mass spec for each one
121574 there is talk of getting it down to a chip thats when it gets interesting
121575 what you can do with the technology that makes it all interesting
121576 newspapers should have licensed craigslists or ebays technology years ago
121577 we bought them because we can turn anything into gold
121578 what is media anymore can you just slap videos up on the web and become a younger and more vibrant rupert murdoch or sumner redstone
121579 amateurish video i get it dont drink diet coke after eating mentos
121580 channels layer cakes slivers political entrepreneurs virtual pipes and other gimmicks
121581 there is only one valid definition of business purpose to create a customer
121582 you want to wear those you wont get the 3d effect from that end
121583 as you can see i can pull up menus in the cave move them around and click on what i want with this wand but the really cool stuff is visualizing stuff here let me pull up my favorite ok if you have ever been to florence you probably waited on line to see michaelangelos david during its recent restoration cleaning really they let in some stanford researchers to do a 3d capture of david over a 30 day period head to toe tip to stern
121584 a set of lasers scanned the entire sculpture digitizing every nook and cranny and crack
121585 we cut a friendly deal and were able to obtain the very large data set the digital david
121586 weve got a whole bunch of windows pcs just above our heads microsoft is one of the benefactors of our work these machines crank away calculating how every one of the pixels should be displayed for your left and then right eye here let me show you cue the drumroll
121587 this is a pg show so we are sticking with just the neck up view your looking at piece of a couple of billion pixels probably now about million plus polygons each accurate down to 2 millimeters which is why i am able to zoom in so closely lets look up his nostrils there you are now lets back off a bit here is something you probably didnt notice if you saw david in florence hes a bit cross eyed his eyes are looking in two different directions
121588 of course we only can capture the surface of the sculpture
121589 ok now if i click to lock in this perspective ah there we are done now i am david fetch me a slingshot i feel strong enough to slay giants today lets look around
121590 ok enough of this fun stuff let me show you what this technology is really used for
121591 this is the model of glucose just to show you we can represent macromolecular structures in 3d this is the killer app for pharmaceutical and biotech companies here let me bring up the model of a tumor cell a bit more complex
121592 we can look at this a lot of different ways we can do 3d images constructed using the 3d iso surface module we process them in metamorph by low pass filtering and then do multi thresholding to segment the image volume and distance transform applied to create concentric shells of the cell
121593 rational drug design is about as real as the tooth fairy doris lets go its time for bloodies at ruloffs
121594 well sure they are not that much different from a flat panel display
121595 oh no as we go from 4 to 16 to 64 slice the detectors can be manufactured discretely and butted up against each other we dont have yield issues
121596 are you ready to buy one today or this month
121597 no no although i wouldnt mind one in my garage im a tech guy
121598 oh ok well these are basically one or two million dollar machines
121599 i know pretty cheap we think we have a variety of advantages over the competition and you will see in the face off that
121600 why so much ive been in enough factories and those flat panels are a couple of hundred bucks each and the motor to rotate cant be more than
121601 probably not we do have high selling expenses when you only sell a hundred of anything there is lead generation and a sales pipeline and funnel
121602 doctors arent buyers not for these machines we sell to a few clinics the rest is into hospitals they are the only ones that can afford them for now
121603 but you said cheaper i mean these can be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars instead of millions
121604 this year is going to be so much better than last years face off
121605 ladies and gentlemen welcome back take your seats fasten your seatbelts this is going to be exciting i am pleased to announce that for our 3 rd annual workstation face off we have five different vendor groups competing well facing off we have five different data sets brain runoff lung colon and heart
121606 on the stage we have workstations from ge healthcare dr gruden please take a bow also vital images philips medical systems siemens medical solutions and terarecon may the best workstation win lets get started
121607 ok lets start with the brain ge you have six minutes for both the angiogram and the perfusion go
121608 ok we can see the internal carotid artery on the right hand side so now lets quickly move over to this area on the left ah not hard to find there it is we see the ica stenosis lets measure it 63 blockage
121609 we can zoom in and clearly delineate the calcified vs the soft plaque
121610 lets mark this tissue at risk for infarction and measure some things while we are over in the left cerebral ok mtt is 86 7 ttp lets call it 52 5
121611 ok time 5 minutes 32 seconds very nice thank you
121612 ok a perennial favorite lets move on to the bowels this years virtual colonoscopy will require identifying and measuring five different polyps as well as comparing supine and prone data sets to differentiate stool from polyps
121613 thank you for this data set we have decided to show off our handheld interface device it is a two handed device requiring minimal keyboard usage
121614 lets go into c a d mode to navigate through the colon
121615 now what you have all been waiting for the grand finale someone left their heart in san francisco
121616 some like to hold up a magnifying glass but i like to keep my hands free for the papers and the dictation machine
121617 uh huh r2 sees it too these triangles are just calcifications but that asterisk means it might be a mass yup we agree usually do it might be a mass lets check last years film might be something no this is probably no problem see its the same size it hasnt grown no problem good
121618 lets schedule a six month follow up solon finkelstein next
121619 the bio rad classification book is over there that big thick one if you want to go through the government regulations
121620 the government insists that if there is something but less than 25 what i consider granular tissue i have to call it probably benign and follow up in three to 12 months but who wants to get a report that says probably benign and worry all that time its a judgment call but its often better to say benign and follow up in six months
121621 well the extra ones must be here somewhere usually they are in the file oh here it is
121622 i feel like going home and getting my catchers mitt
121623 doc i promised i wouldnt get in the way but you keep referring to what r2 thinks
121624 sort of here ive had enough of this for now lets take a walk ill show you around and maybe youll get an idea of how this works now
121625 ok this is the mammography machine you can figure out for yourself what goes where we take a top down and a side to side view four films in all a tech brings the films over here to this kodak machine where they are developed
121626 it takes all of 90 seconds and the films end up in this bin the tech just moves them over here to the r2 box and loads them in
121627 the r2 scans all our mammogram films i think it takes 30 seconds per image i look at the original films and then i can then pull up what r2 thinks on those monitors we used to do double blind two radiologists reading every mammogram thats the law now its just one and r2 they call it computer aided detection and we can do away with the extra human reading to me its a pretty good backup
121628 we do a lot of mammograms here this is a slow morning and ill probably go through 40 of them theyve been underpaying for mammograms for years
121629 it gets kind of expensive to have two of us read films so one plus r2 works maybe even better not sure plus we get reimbursements 29 i think
121630 we got one of the first ones r2 is down in sunnyvale or mountain view or something
121631 most mammograms are negative i think something like one half of one percent show actual cancer we find that younger docs
121632 recall something like 10 of patients for biopsies or mri or something else thats a pretty high false positive rate us old guys are at around a 4 recall rate hey ive done 250 000 of these over my career and never been sued
121633 so do you see a day when r2 would look at films first and then alert you to look only at the ones it flags
121634 i dont think so technicians do that already flag something they see on film put a mark on it but the liability is so great i dont see your scenario happening ive never been sued but you need someone to blame
121635 except maybe in the military you can get away with anything in the military
121636 great this should take about 3 minutes put your hands over your head
121637 ok you can collect your things and wait out in the lobby
121638 all the things that the displaced gang members deported from the united states have brought there theyre into the aesthetic but they dont really understand why
121639 gave all of central america carte blanc to start killing off all the gang kids
121640 its basically a low level genocide where theyve been killing hundreds of kids a year in each central american country
121641 a program that tries to get youth out of gangs basically save their lives find them a direction in life
121642 our concept was arte es la vida art is life
121643 for this mural to be that widely received as a community muralist as a community artist its as good as it could get
121644 if i could do projects like that for the rest of my life i would have the most successful life
121645 cause its not really about money its about your work counting for something
121646 we are representing the face and the cross that is this place we see the beauty of our city as well as the suffering by the residents of the marginalized neighborhoods
121647 all of a sudden we all heard this scream this bloodcurdling scream
121648 when we came back on the bus he was cutting the guys head off and pretty much gutting him up
121649 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
121650 there was no rage in him it was just like he was a robot or something
121651 some people were puking some people were crying other people were in shock everybody was running screaming off the bus
121652 working on wall street id listened to plenty of pitches for the latest miracle drug or medical device but every time i looked at health care costs were going up not down
121653 its embedded in their brains today you need a doctor for a blood test a procedure even drugs are controlled by their prescriptions
121654 ive trained myself to look for quantum leaps entire industries that are created overnight from some new technology
121655 wasnt finding it in computers or cellphones or even consumer electronics
121656 i had the time i had the energy i had the desire i had the resources just had no good ideas
121657 health care budges even slightly from chronic care to early detection the waves of change rip through medicine like cat 5 hurricanes
121658 i drink only on days that end with a y
121659 we bought them because we can turn anything into gold
121660 in this country you gotta make the money first then when you get the money you get the power then when you get the power then you get the women
121661 so there are millions of people who play wow there are also millions of people with a drinking problem i place them in the same category
121662 it has kesslers trademark bawdy stories and acid observations but it is an outsiders examination and diagnosis of an industry that looks poised for change
121663 the fda is like the fcc and big pharma is like the regional bells
121664 this guy was zooming through someones brain like it was level 60 in world of warcraft the place went crazy this was repeated on each of the workstations by different doctors to often thunderous applause i had a mild headache from all the excitement
121665 this one specific integrin alphavbeta3 is specifically expressed on proliferating endothelial cells and tumor cells that are forming new blood vessels thats how we catch them we find these integrins
121666 in this country you gotta make the money first then when you get the money you get the power then when you get the power then you get the women
121667 so there are millions of people who play wow there are also millions of people with a drinking problem i place them in the same category
121668 im 47 and i got really scared surely there was some way to look inside me to see if i had some cancer or was going to have a heart attack any time soon
121669 there are lots of interesting tools in medicine but almost all of it is way too expensive so insurance companies and medicare wont pay for it until you are actually sick
121670 it blew my mind but then again the thought of carrying around 4 gig memory devices or 20 gig hard drives and using them to listen to music was pretty whacky not long ago
121671 maybe the early detection brakes arent locking up on the active runway of runaway spending on chronic patients it feels like its not the end of the road in portola valley at stanford at the hutch or for scanning instead it feels like the start of something big probably just the end of medicine as we know it

121684 guardare in faccia al proprio destino non facile anche perch il futuro non si vede mai
121685 we are working flat out to develop and improve our kers system we have investigated various options and now the challenge is to refine the system before we run it in a car for the first time at this stage our development has been completely based at the factory rather than the race track because 95 of kers development can be done on the kers simulation dyno the 2009 regulations mean the tf109 will be quite different to the tf108 so we see little advantage in testing kers on the track at this stage
121686 we have not set a date for this as it will depend on our development progress in the factory we will run kers in the car only when the system has met our stringent requirements for performance and safety
121687 the fia has defined the regulations in order to avoid a huge difference between a team having a very good kers versus a team having a poor one kers will not make a massive difference to lap time as the extra power will only be available for around 6 5s per lap so a time benefit of around 0 1s and 0 3s per lap is realistic without considering the weight distribution and packaging implications but an additional benefit kers could offer is a chance to overtake on one lap performance it is questionable whether it will provide an advantage compared to a non kers car when you take into account the weight distribution issues but providing that you have traction you could have a better chance to overtake
121688 no it is expected that our car with kers would still be at the minimum weight as defined in the rules because at the moment our car is significantly lighter than the 605kg minimum but we comply with the regulations by using ballast if kers makes the base weight of the car 25 35kg heavier then you have less ballast to move around and this could have a performance impact as it limits the opportunities to change weight distribution however we do not know exactly what effect this will have as we obviously do not have experience of the tf109 on track therefore we are pressing ahead with our kers development
121689 the 2009 regulations make kers optional not compulsory so it is logical that every team has considered that possibility however kers has the potential to bring an improvement in lap time so we are working at full speed to take advantage of this opportunity our development is focused on producing a kers system which is appropriate for formula 1 and brings performance increase we have a group dedicated to this and we trust them to deliver
121690 inevitably a new technology of this kind requires significant resources in order to develop a safe and effective solution costs have been particularly significant with kers because it is a major new technology for formula 1 and there are a number of potential solutions which had to be looked at
121691 if there is some know how in a company it has to be an advantage but we do not expect this to provide us with much tangible benefit compared to the other teams as kers is not directly comparable to what is done on a normal road car formula 1 is a unique environment where weight reduction is vitally important the way toyota develops a road car is different and the aim is for efficiency in terms of fuel consumption the ideal version in a road car is more sophisticated than kers in formula 1 because it not only means you can downsize your engine but also takes into account other conditions it recovers energy from the front and the rear and there is no limitation on the time it is deployed
121692 and given the way the market is at present responding very quickly to bad news it is likely to spark share selling
121693 the market in north america is difficult and unless there are huge changes in oil prices or exchange rates its only going to get more difficult

121741 at 12 10am on wednesday we received a third party allegation that a photographer had been spat at by an individual outside a restaurant in hanway street w1
121742 officers established the incident occurred at approximately 10 20pm on tuesday evening
121743 the alleged suspect a 22 year old male was spoken to by police
121744 when i opened the door i heard my wife groaning she was vomiting and had a rope tied round her neck i saw the children lying in bed i moved over and touched them they were dead
121745 she wanted to start working but we had nobody to take care of our children i wanted us to get a maid before she would start working
121746 my brother telephoned me when i arrived the bodies lay on the bed marion was very cold and her neck had scratches neighbours said they saw their mother holding a kaveera and a piece of wood she could have used those items to kill them
121747 mama marion stayed in her house most part of the day it was unusual because i did not hear any sounds from the house i saw her only in the morning when she stood in her doorway
121748 we wonder why she did this her husband works hard and often returns home at night he was providing her everything and she would dress smartly
121749 recently she beat them up badly when we intervened she brushed us off saying after all they were her children
121750 we thought she was a quiet character but she would beat up her children regularly and whenever we intervened she would tell us not to meddle into her domestic affairs
121751 one day i sternly warned her against beating the children since they were also our responsibility
121752 they were young and risked catching diseases whenever we mentioned it to their mother she kept quiet but she did pay the fees they owed us no money this term
121753 our problems should not be the end of the world the children had no fault yet their mum ended their lives

121758 enterasys was taken private in 2006 and has pretty much remained silent for quite a long time given some of the financial viability concerns i think a lot of current customers wanted any sign that there was light at the end of the gores group tunnel siemens provides the brand some cash and a promise for a more stable revenue stream
121759 if anything it means that gores is more committed to enterasys than ever they kind of need enterasys to make the whole thing work
121760 siemens has got to be careful how much they position enterasys as part of the voip solution

121769 it was a cruise holiday you take whatever mother nature dishes out
121770 the captain said it was seven metre swells and 50 knot winds and thats not much for a ship like that
121771 there was obviously some superficial damage internally from items that moved around as it took a sudden movement
121772 but we have a team of technical people assessing the ship and public safety is our absolute priority
121773 because the vessel has been hit by such heavy weather causing injuries to a number of passengers mnz and the various other agencies which have responsibility for the safety of the ship need to be satisfied that she has been thoroughly checked over in all respects and cleared before being allowed to depart new zealand

121789 weve got theories weve been talking to police and experts in all different fields
121790 the difficulty is every theory ends up in a dead end or a point where it becomes ridiculous and theres no sort of factual information to back up you know to make that theory have any substance and thats the difficulty of the whole thing
121791 the family are still doing things very tough a day doesnt go by where its not spoken about and looked at
121792 were hoping that the inquest will drive out that information that the authorities have got or the possibility that other people that havent come forward yet will come forward with something that we can use
121793 the overwhelming support and help weve had through this would indicate that people would do everything they could to help but if theres a sinister side to it someone might be sitting on something that they know or saw
121794 ultimately that would be the best outcome out of the whole lot

121801 mi nombre es alonso de paones y nac en el reino de le n qu lejanos quedan todos esos recuerdos ahora que pienso en que tan s lo quedamos cuatro caballeros de la orden de santa mar a de monte gaudio en tierra santa somos conscientes de que los inmensos pecados y la nefasta ambici n nos han llevado hasta esta derrota pero para mi desgracia yo tampoco estoy libre de faltas jur que no ser a de ninguna otra mujer y hu de mi tierra para alejarme de mi amada jimena de sanfelismo sabiendo que jam s podr a olvidarla y que su recuerdo seguir a cubriendo de herrumbre mi alma de le n me traje aquel juramento que ha sellado mi destino y una amenaza siniestra silenciosa y eterna que me ha ido persiguiendo hasta mis ltimos d as en jerusal n ahora tras a os de recuerdos de remordimientos y peligros s que debo terminar con todo ello y no hay mejor sitio que aqu en lo alto de la colina del gozo desde donde los primeros cruzados vieron la santa ciudad y derramaron l grimas de alegr a he picado espuelas y junto a mis hermanos lanza en ristre me dispongo a cerrar mis cuentas con el alt simo mientras ella sigue presente en mis pensamientos pater noster qui es in coelis santificetur nomen tuum

121806 kaya kailangan kong umalis and i have to stay there for a while
121807 ang situatuion kasi is i really have to stay there for a while e para kasing halimbawa dito sa atin nag aartista ako wala pa ako masyadong name ngayon nakatira ako sa bohol you have to stay here in manila
121808 yon that is the question kasi halimbawa may party you have to be visible e punta ka sa party makikilala mo si ganito ganon yon e kailangan visible ka e parang back to zero ako doon e well ang maganda lang sa akin kasi ang kilala kong mga producer mga jew like sina lawrence bender producer of inconvenient truth kill bill buti na lang sila jewish kasi ang producer ko doon e kapag pilipino ang producer ko hindi na ako magpu pursue
121809 kasi gusto ko iyong trabaho e alam mo naman yong dream natin if talagang sure na makakakuha ng another hollywood project
121810 right now its good for us kasi that will give us time to think more about whats the best well we know already whats the best pero ito yong time na healing time ito e and realization
121811 but of course we know already the answer kaya we cant be separated okay were not separating
121812 babalik din naman ako kaagad mabo bore ako doon sa new york e magre resume yong show the singing bee and pakikiramdaman ko iyon kung medyo matagal pa iyon e
121813 i wanna thank all the people who continually support us yong mga nanonood mga viewers from all over the world i know its hitting u s japan etc kaya nagpapasalamat po ako talaga sa lahat
121814 magiging isang oras na kami kasi sayang yong mga joke namin mga side comments namin hindi nyo po talaga napapanood lahat kapag naging isang oras na kami naku mas matutuwa po kayo
121815 so abangan nyo po ang pagbabalik ng the singing bee mawawala kami for a while pero magbabalik po kami na may dalang revenge
121816 its blackout more memorable yong production just like the pictorial the process of how i prepared for it
121817 its not just about that its a show its fun and its part of the tradition ng bench to showcase their talent and produkto nila its a perfect venue na magsama sama yong mga taga ibang istasyon alam mo yon nagkakaisa lahat sila
121818 when i came out wala akong nakikita wala akong masyadong nakita much more wala akong narinig ganun ako kapag concentrated sa ginagawa ko parang nagkakaroon ako ng blackout talaga
121819 so ang focus ko lang talaga e gawin ko lang ang dapat kong gawin and tapusin ko lang yon yon lang naman iyon so kung ano man yong reaction afterwards hindi ko siya nakita hindi ko siya narinig
121820 were planning to get together yon nga birthday special para sa mga supporters namin its going to be in araneta coliseum isa siyang malaking birthday special lahat ng mga hits ni marian makikita nyo doon lahat ng mga kalokohan na puwede mong gawin makikita mo doon
121821 masaya lang siya its a fun party iba ito sa nakikita ninyo sa tv hindi kami uma acting dito we will still perform mga kung anu anong klaseng mga song and dance numbers kahit ako hindi ko pa alam kung ano talaga pero im sure its going to be fun
121822 i really spend a lot time sa aking birthday na makasama ko sila taun taon magmula nang magsimula ako they are the same people that are still there so mahalaga sila sa akin
121823 enjoy lang wala pang masyadong seryosong plan at saka na iyan
121824 alam mo pag konti kayo konti rin ang insecurities e yun lang yun e di ba basta kailangan masaya ka sa ginagawa mo
121825 nagkakagulo silang tatlo si piolo si dingdong at saka si richard kung sino yung lalabas bago mag finale
121826 so sabi ni ben chan owner of bench kung ganun na nagkakagulo kayo tanggalin na yung tatlo
121827 ako hindi ko alam ha but ang pagkakaalam ko lang all the numbers were presented to them how it will be presented doon sa mga meeting meeting nila in fact during the rehearsal night nandun sila para makita nilang lahat actual rehearsal yun kung ako ang tatanungin mo dapat noon pa lang gabi rehearsal nakita mo na nakorek mo na if ever you wanted to make some changes
121828 who are we to say na palakpakan nyo ako o hindi who are we to blame at saka pagdating talaga sa stage pagdating sa modeling lalo na yung mga big show na ganun mga gala alam mo kanya kanyang gimik yan
121829 anong ginawa ni jake cuenca kaya napansin siya anong ginawa nung isa pbb housemate kian kazemi naglagay ng rose dun sa ano niya si dingdong what did he do he took his time tinanggal niya yung pantalon niya nang dahn dahan nag build ng excitement gimik talaga
121830 mas marami akong time with richard kasi nung bata pa siya kasama ni tito eddie gutierrez kasama ni tita annabelle magkakaibi gan kami and then some of his projects si douglas quijano gomas manager ang nagha handle so parang hes part of our family also
121831 sa pogi factor lahat naman sila mga pogi e but im really happy for them im happy for richard dingdong even from the other station like piolo because hes also a bench member
121832 naiintindihan ko naman na hinahanap nila ang ginawa ko dati pero naging test din naman po sa akin ito na at the end of the day parang siyempre nandoon yung question sa utak ko na baka tinitilian lang nila ako dahil naghubad ako pero alam ko naman po na ang mga taong nagpupunta sa bench fashion show gustong makakita ng naka brief doon ako masaya
121833 okay masayang masaya po ako sa nangyari sa bench siyempre masaya rin ako na masaya ang network ko sa akin napaka weird nung night siyempre ang daming pressures sa lahat ng artista pero masayang masaya po ako sa lahat ng nangyari
121834 yun nga e yun nga pero siyempre ibinigay ko na po yun sa mga taong nag underwear hindi naman po ako pupunta roon para manapaw ng ibang stars siguro yung ipinakita ko po roon yun lang naman po ang kulang na hindi ko pa ipinapakita e bale nagawa ko na ang lahat
121835 what i did is nag 50 50 ako at hindi ako nag overboard tulad ng palagi kong ginagawa pero siyempre ano rin hindi ako magdi disappoint ng mga taong nag aabang naghihintay ng gimmick sa tingin ko hindi ko naman sila nabigo dahil wala naman po akong naririnig na masama
121836 ako po personally hindi po ako nakikipagkumpitensiya kasi ako po bago po ako makipagkumpitensiya gusto ko munang maayos ang trabaho ko bago ko makipag compete sa kanila gusto ko na maayos ko muna ang trabaho ko at yun naman ang tinitingnan ko palagi ang trabaho ko
121837 siyempre meron may healthy competition pero more than anything else ako kasi ayoko ng nakikipagkumpitensiya dahil nakakaragdag lang ng pressure siyempre kapag nagko compete ka masyado kang nagmamadali at the end of the day madarapa ka rin sa kakamadali mo mas mainam na yung iniisip mo lang kung ano ang kailangan mong gawin
121838 basta ako masayang masaya na ako sa naging reaction ng tao sa akin at masaya ako dahil nandoon ang nanay ko tatay ko first time nila kong nakita sa ganoong klase ng environment at pag uwi ko naman proud naman sila sa akin
121839 at maging ang mga tao sa abs they called me they said it was a good show at least daw hindi ako sumobra masaya everyone was happy
121840 may nabasa nga ako sa isang diyaryo na laos na daw kami nina sam milby nina diether ocampo ang sa akin lang hindi ako mag e elaborate kung tinilian ako or hindi
121841 naiintindihan ko naman na hinahanap nila ang ginawa ko dati pero naging test din naman po sa akin ito na at the end of the day parang siyempre nandoon yung question sa utak ko na baka tinitilian lang nila ako dahil naghubad ako
121842 kung meron man nagsasabi na kinarma ako sa bench fashion show nagpapasalamat ako dahil napakaganda ng karma ko nung gabing yun dahil lahat ng gusto kong mangyari ay nangyari nung gabing yun
121843 well all i could say is im happy with what happened with bench i gave my best and i gave my 100 at na appreciate ko po ang suporta ng gabing yun sa araneta
121844 taping ako e simula nang mag artista ako lahat ng birthday ko may trabaho ako two years na akong nagtang birthday ko pangatlo na ito
121845 actually ayaw kong sabihin laging sinasabi nila na princess nila ako ganyan ganyan na ako ang next big star ayaw kong isipin ang mga ganyan kasi kung iisipin mo nang ganun wala namang mangyayari sa buhay ko e mamaya lumaki pa ang ulo ko mamaya ganun
121846 at saka ang lagi kong sinasabi sige kung nasa isip ko na ako yong big star na yon at ako ang princess nila hindi ako ganito magsalita sa inyo ngayon so gusto ko lang yong normal lang yong lahat yong totoo ako sa sarili ko
121847 alam nyo iyon ever since at saka alam ng tao kung gaano ako ka transparent kung gaano ako kapalaban kung gaano ako walang kaanu ano na kiyeme ganun talaga ako masaya ako na nagagawa ko yong trabaho ko at nagagawa ko nang ako to at wala akong tinatago yon ang masarap
121848 ang nag isip niyan yong mga managers namin popoy caritativo for marian and perry lansigan for dingdong at saka mga boss sa gma 7
121849 parang ang dami nang nagawa ng mga tao sa amin bilang gantimpala naman sa kanila bibigyan namin sila ng libreng concert namin ni dingdong sa araneta
121850 kasi birthday namin parang thanksgiving na rin para sa kanila fans kasi sobrang oa ang suporta nila sa amin
121851 actually noong rampa na yon nagdyo joke nga ako sabi ko parang napasubo yata ako ah kasi nakaka tense talaga siya at hindi ko alam kung paano ako tatanggapin ng mga tao kung ano ang gagawin ko
121852 noong hindi pa ako lumalabas talagang kinakabahan pa ako pero noong lumabas na ako tapos narinig ko yong mga tao nagtsi cheer talaga sila sa akin nawala yong kaba ko
121853 actually kinu consider namin siya pero hindi ngayon kasi ang dami ko talagang ginagawa itong august na ito mayroon akong australia para sa pictorial ng jag tapos pupunta kami ng new jersey tapos ang dami kong commercial na isu shoot tapos meron pa kaming movie na gagawin ni dingdong so hindi pa namin alam kung kailan siya isisingit pero kinu consider namin siya
121854 excited din akong makatrabaho si iza kasi magaling din e alam mo yon magaling umiyak matsa challenge ka rin talaga
121855 at saka first time din namin ni dong puro kami soap opera magkasama first time lang na movie so excited din talaga
121856 gusto ko na palagi akong masaya kasi importante sa akin ang pagiging masaya at saka sana mas mahalin ako ng mga tao sa pagiging ako kasi gusto ko yong sarili ko sa pagiging ako e
121857 kahit pa sabihin nila na yan si marian naku palaban iyan bungangera yan i dont care basta ako totoo ako sa sarili ko na ito ako naipapakita ko sa inyo kung sino ako kesa naman sa wala ngang nasasabi sa yo pero hindi naman totoo yon
121858 i take all those things constructively opinyon yan ng mga tao na kailangang pinapakinggan din idol is such a huge franchise a lot of expectations are going into it
121859 kasama sina gary valenciano piolo pascual michael v marian rivera kyla jaya and more
121860 personal favorites ko sa album yung songs ni rey valera
121861 kay vic sotto yung kung sakali and i like it naaalala ko noong kinakanta pa yun ni pabs dadivas ang lakas lakas niya sa radyo at maski sa malls kapag nagpu promote ako nararamdaman ko ang pagtanggap ng mga tao and im so happy
121862 sa youtube nga im so surprised maganda ang comments ng mga bata nakakatuwa dahil maganda ang response doon sa kung sakali lalo nat yung music video kami ni marian rivera ang magkasama di ba
121863 first love ko singing kaya gusto ko lang balikan palagay ko okey naman ang response ng new generation for the past twenty years din kasi tinutugtog ako ngayon inilabas itong bagong album at yung carrier single talagang marami ang nagre request mukhang tanggap siya ng mga kabataan nasa approach din binago ko kasi ang interpretation mahirap tularan yung mga original so i have to sing it na magaan lang pakinggan
121864 this is why nahirapan kaming isingit ang schedule para sa movie na dapat ay gagawin namin ni regine for viva and gma films
121865 hindi ko rin alam kung ano ang pupuwedeng mangyari lets just wait and see kasi tingnan mo naman ang support sa amin ng gma 7 pareho kaming hindi na nawawalan ng trabaho ni regine kaya yung ibang offers talagang mahirap isingit
121866 opinyon yan ng mga tao na kailangang pinapakinggan din idol is such a huge franchise a lot of expectations are going into it
121867 mayroon namang positive comments lately medyo gumaganda na ang mga nasasabi kaya ibig sabihin were taking the criticisms well were learning
121868 yung mga batikos kina jolina magdangal at wyngard tracy ang tingin ko kasi riyan walang maling comments
121869 habang naroroon kami sa gala iba yung tunog sa tv iba rin yung tapon may aspects na ganoon that we really have to consider all in all maganda ang resulta ng ratings namin kaya happy na rin kami roon
121870 wala naman sigurong bayarang nangyayari kasi malinaw naman yan na text votes ang pagbabasehan ng lahat nakakalimutan lang ng ibang contestants na hindi lang ito talent search you really have to campaign its part of the mechanics
121871 we put a lot of that heartbreak into the script into the show so it would hurt as much to watch as it did to have it taken away from us i would not have been as brutal about the ending had we had another season

121904 remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided
121905 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
121906 yes great and when will george w bush and dick cheney face trial for war crimes
121907 the commander in chief and those under him authorized a systematic regime of torture a government policy was promulgated to the field whereby the geneva conventions and the uniform code of military justice were disregarded there is no longer any doubt as to whether the current administration has committed war crimes
121908 the threat of domestic criminal prosecution under the war crimes act
121909 in which u s military and civilian personnel are credibly alleged to have abused or killed detainees
121910 u s facilities throughout afghanistan iraq and at guantanamo bay
121911 is there a difference of emphasis it certainly looks as though there is
121912 the military option although always available is not our preferred route
121913 we have made that point clear to them and the world in our public statements and private meetings
121914 a policy that consists of keeping all options on the table must be maintained
121915 is a sovereign state and we understand that they view this as an existential threat and we take the threat thats posed by iran seriously as well
121916 risks are rising in cell phone handsets on which nec has pinned comeback hopes and pasolink the main driver of earnings to date
121917 we have a lot of long term business in that sector but clearly we are benefiting from current operations in iraq and afghanistan
121918 but the lackluster top line performance coupled with the overhang of the doj u s department of justice investigation is likely to somewhat offset the increased guidance
121919 we see those three in particular as markets wed like to add to our home market list
121920 the u s whether its mccain or obama are determined to maintain national security and their role in the world defense spending will stay at very very high levels
121921 risks are rising in cell phone handsets on which nec has pinned comeback hopes and pasolink the main driver of earnings to date
121922 we now expect that the pretax return on sales for the year to be at least 4 per cent
121923 business conditions for the automobile industry have deteriorated sharply over the past weeks
121924 rising oil and raw material prices the weakness of the us dollar the impact of the international financial crisis and a weaker us economy have made business conditions significantly more difficult
121925 ach der karadzic im literarischen quartett fand ich ihn immer ganz sympathisch aber mit dem vollbart ist er mir irgendwie unheimlich als h tte er was zu verbergen
121926 eine riesensauerei was da wieder auf dem r cken der steuerzahler veranstaltet wird wir haben uns in der ddr 40 jahre lang verschaukeln lassen und mir hats gefallen aber das werde ich nicht unterschreiben das k nnen sie denen da oben ruhig sagen
121927 naja ich finde das schon ne heftige sache aber hallooo v lkermord geht ja mal gar nicht und was der gemacht hat war schon hammer ich mein gehts noch jetzt kriegt der zwar seinen superlangen proze und so aber das wird auch nicht wirklich prickelnd
121928 go placidly amid the noise and haste and remember what peace there may be in silence
121929 all our letters are forwarded to the supreme court they will study it if they will require additional information it depends
121930 the market at the moment has decided that growth concerns are dominating
121931 and therefore that the rise in inflation we are seeing is unlikely to have a sustained impact on policy rates
121932 surely we will see a rise in key policy rates at the next meeting this month because inflation is accelerating
121933 inflation may peak in the fourth quarter but only if oil prices fall
121934 the bank of korea is expected to raise interest rates next week to tackle inflation and to control the money supply but im not so sure on its next steps
121935 investors will have to take their cue from the inflation rate in the previous month
121936 it would make them more jittery about going back to the market
121937 market players are watching for the non farm payrolls report tonight
121938 the general rule of thumb is that lower oil prices go hand in hand with a stronger us dollar against major currencies
121939 this should weigh on asian currencies such as the singapore dollar and taiwan dollar that track major currencies
121940 market is still playing it cautiously on ringgit direction given heavy intervention for most part of this week
121941 politics is still there but there has been a shift towards the rates story
121942 the factor inhibiting a bigger than 25 basis points hike is likely to emanate from stronger rupiah in the recent sessions amidst healthy capital inflows to the shore
121943 were very pleasantly surprised the first half loan demand has been strong
121944 i think going forward depending on how the economy turns out we think we can still do somewhere between 12 and 15 percent for the whole year
121945 the good news is that everyone has been able to hold their costs the bad news is we are revenue challenged everywhere
121946 with inflation there is margin compression and we are suffering it but it encourages us to work harder
121947 we are hearing voices i believe those inside the rubble will be saved
121948 i can confirm that we arrested mohammed dali carvalho santos yesterday near the murder scene i cannot tell you exactly where but it was in a hiding place he had fled to after the murder he has already confessed to murdering cara and decapitating her body
121949 he has yet to show any remorse for what he has done he has not cried or expressed regret of any kind
121950 the murder took place at a flat in goiania near to the university which they used to share until they stopped dating some time before the killing after cara ended the relationship
121951 cara was living with friends at the time she was murdered and mohammed was still at the flat he killed her with a single stab wound to the ribs using a kitchen knife which we have recovered and are currently examining for forensic evidence
121952 we have found drugs but i am not in a position to say how many drugs have been found or what type of drugs they are
121953 we can confirm the death of a british national in goiania in brazil next of kin have been informed and we are providing consular assistance to the family
121954 myspace comedy is another example of how myspace continues to innovate and break new ground on the social web
121955 theres a lot of frustration that can come while getting this prepared but when the day comes its all worth it
121956 the festival is very positive its succeeding weve been very successful in our endeavours
121957 if it rains this weekend then the festival may be in a deficit next year its a very thin line and you cant walk that line continually
121958 the lack of money over the years has set moth research back at least a decade
121959 la d forestation comme toujours continue tre tr s importante
121960 its an important weekend for discussing the relevant issues of the day
121961 the economy and the loss of jobs are of great concern and thats why im running for governor to lead indiana in a different direction in growing the economy and in creating good paying jobs
121962 its a difficult time for hoosiers theyre paying record high amounts for gasoline theyre paying outrageously high prices for groceries when they go to the grocery store we have a home mortgage foreclosure crisis in indiana home sales are at an all time low
121963 a state that had good paying jobs that paid better than the national average those workers now make about 88 cents on the dollar relative to the rest of the country i come from a farming background i live on a farm and i know what its like to struggle to make ends meet
121964 who continues to go around this state telling people just how good things are that leads to more frustration on the part of hoosiers
121965 to suspend the indiana state sales tax collected on gasoline because the state is getting a windfall and the governor increased the sales tax from 6 to 7 cents we are one of only seven states that charge a sales tax on gasoline hoosiers need a break and hoosiers would save about 25 cents on the gallon if the state sales tax were suspended
121966 i know people are concerned about whether we at the state level can do anything about the gas prices about jobs and about the impact that house bill 1001 is having on cities and towns and schools thats a big concern for everybody
121967 i cannot tell you how many concerns have been brought to me from our district about the problems that people are having with the privatization of the family and social services administration weve got to do something about that
121968 about southern indiana that i think encourages people to relax a little enjoy each other
121969 its time for democrats to get together in a less formal environment than the democratic convention to discuss policy
121970 ive never gone to french lick without driving to the west baden grounds because i have always found it so lovely i am really looking forward to seeing the restored dome
121971 this is an annual cycle which we have already predicted

121980 the high growth areas in which we do business have borne the brunt of the collapsing real estate prices
121981 there is a domino reaction with slowing employment and the declining wealth effect has created anxiety far beyond our borders

121988 we want more people to participate in our democracy and we want you to come up with ways to make this happen
121989 were doubling down were going to increase the headcount and operating expenses by 30 percent this year
121990 we know that things are tough for the auto industry but its the perfect time to make this investment there are new customers coming into the market and they are looking for new experiences
121991 there are a lot of technologies that are two to three years out that are going to provide even more connectivity and innovation
121992 theres such a disconnect between what people experience in their cars and what they experience in the rest of their lives it hasnt really evolved that much
121993 even if you get a 10 percent or 20 percent market share youve got an enormous scale
121994 ford and microsoft working together to deliver sync has been a great experience and demonstrates what can happen when the power of two iconic brands comes together
121995 ford sync has proven to be a tremendous differentiator for us in the marketplace and working with microsoft has been the key element in setting the industry benchmark for connectivity
121996 clearly the customers are recognizing the value and they are willing to pay for it
121997 in short order sentiment in the telecom sector has gone from bullish to guarded to well slightly queasy
121998 i think at amp t is pedaling as fast as it can to transform themselves from a wire line to a wireless company
121999 if you own a home business they are going to want to sell you not only a line for your home but one for your office too
122000 they are going to want to sell you more more of everything
122001 but there comes a time when all the people who want to leave have already left
122002 we start at a set of well connected initial pages and follow each of their links to new pages then we follow the links on those new pages to even more pages and so on until we have a huge list of links
122003 even after removing exact duplicates we saw a trillion unique urls and the number of individual web pages out there is growing by several billion pages per day
122004 this graph of one trillion urls is similar to a map made up of one trillion intersections so multiple times every day we do the computational equivalent of fully exploring every intersection of every road in the united states except itd be a map about 50 000 times as big as the u s with 50 000 times as many roads and intersections
122005 we start at a set of well connected initial pages and follow each of their links to new pages then we follow the links on those new pages to even more pages and so on until we have a huge list of links

122008 customers continue to take advantage of our low prices free shipping and amazon prime
122009 amazon prime membership costs less than a tank of gas more and more customers are joining the program and enjoying its benefits
122010 its a tragic ending to what was once a warm and fuzzy silicon valley story
122011 frankly we are challenging some of the core assumptions that we have made about our business
122012 instead of focusing on being an auction business we are looking at what it takes to create the best marketplace out there
122013 ive paid ebay many hundreds of thousands in fees over the past several years and believed them when they talked about a level playing field and they just plain and simple are going back on their word
122014 there is fair and there is outright stabbing you in the back
122015 the way our fees are structured we cant compete with a company with free three day fixed price listings
122016 you can imagine why most sellers are pretty upset about that deal
122017 we have to fit our business model to theirs most sellers think it should be the other way around they are doing what they think is the best for them and we just have to try to hang onto their tail
122018 this is open to everyone its a strong incentive for sellers to strive for greatness and grow their ebay business
122019 people now expect that something you buy online should be nicely wrapped in a box and sitting on your doorstep 48 hours later the best companies like amazon do that
122020 ebay has to make it clear that it can participate in the fastest part of e commerce growth
122021 its head and shoulders above the rest of the blogging services
122022 the attraction for the bad guys in targeting blogger is that things pretty much get spidered instantly into google because it blogger is part of google
122023 we see 16 000 malicious web pages added every day thats one every five seconds and thats just little old sophos google may see more than that
122024 you could post a link into someones blog and even if you checked that link at the time it may be totally harmless in 20 minutes time the hacker says ok googles now checked me now ill update the page so you have to continually scan all of the links on all of the blog pages to do this properly which basically is another whole new google re spidering the web to check if theres something malicious there
122025 google takes the security of our users very seriously and we work hard to protect them from malware
122026 using blogger or any google product to serve or host malware is a violation of our product policies we actively work to detect and remove sites that serve malware from our network
122027 this is not a quarter where they can go back to microsoft and say they deserve a higher price
122028 and microsoft cant come to them and say the business is falling out of bed and we can pick you up for a song
122029 higher than the national figure for all other countries in the world except china
122030 the united states may have the lowest pc software piracy rate in the world but still
122031 oh if only people paid for their software then little timmy would have a new middle school to go to
122032 the majority of bsas leads come from current or former employees who have information relating to the unlicensed software activity
122033 as soon as you get into vista applications in notebook and desktop you start running into very demanding applications because vista is not optimized for flash memory solid state disk
122034 the next generation controllers need to basically compensate for vista shortfalls
122035 unfortunately ssds performance in the vista environment falls short of what the market really needs and that is why we need to develop the next generation which well start sampling end of this year early next year
122036 we have very good internal controller technology as you know that said id say that we are now behind because we did not fully understand frankly the limitations in the vista environment
122037 in very low end ultra low cost pcs existing controllers can get the job done for 8 16 and 32 gigabyte storage because these are relatively unsophisticated requirements
122038 the loading of software into the ram creates a copy under the copyright act
122039 numerous courts that have held that the transmission of information through a computers random access memory or ram creates a copy for purposes of the copyright act
122040 the court is not free to disregard ninth circuit precedent directly on point
122041 whether the transferee kept the copy acquired from the copyright holder
122042 nintendo was already planning to appeal this case to the federal circuit court
122043 the recent ruling by the trial court does not impact that decision
122044 there are lots of false starts where the band cant get it together

122050 ive always been a big believer in art going hand in hand with wherever it comes from
122051 de boot kan vertrekken we weten alleen nog niet naar waar hij juist naartoe vaart en wie er aan het stuur staat
122052 het is ook niet onze taak om dat te bepalen
122053 voor de mechanismen de organisatie van de dialoog en wie die moet leiden was er te weinig tijd bovendien waren veel betrokkenen met vakantie
122054 im honoured to get this from the scouts but im also really pleased that thousands of young people are being encouraged to learn about food and cooking through the scouting movement
122055 i hope they will develop their passion for food into adulthood so that they can look after themselves and their families with some decent cooking
122056 ik heb de afgelopen jaren behoorlijk ge nvesteerd in mijn persoonlijke ontwikkeling door drie jaar in buitenlandse dienst te rijden bij de rabo ploeg wil ik me verder ontwikkelen

122060 barack obama glaubt keinesfalls dass die mccain kampagne rasse als thema benutzt aber er glaubt sehr wohl dass sie die alte schmalspurpolitik benutzt um die w hler von den wahren themen des wahlkampfes abzulenken
122061 es ist ein gro er schritt einen 46 jahre alten schwarzen kerl namens barack obama zu w hlen
122062 wir glauben dass der ton des wahlkampfes sich nicht mehr ndern wird
122063 brooklyn based group who built up a solid fan base thanks to touring with oxford collapse
122064 its an awful era in a sense because its the age of narcissism its probably worse than global warming
122065 it must have something to do with the flood through every part of society of popular culture of film photography television and performance all this look at me stuff people dont read as much they cant write you get film stars giving their views on everything its quite serious but nothing can be done about it as soon as you complain you look like an antique
122066 its very dangerous to disobey archetypes in art its so deep structured in us
122067 this seems to be a ghastly pattern i started another novel and spent 18 months maybe two years on it then i put it aside its not to say i wont go back to it it was nothing but a man and woman talking and i thought aside from the difficulty i was sick of men and women talking anyway but there had to be more underneath the same thing happened with eucalyptus i spent a couple of years mucking around with a book that i wasnt comfortable with i chucked that one out
122068 everything started to go grey and tilting and i thought blimey im not sure im going to another few minutes i would have been in trouble
122069 psychology and philosophy too much of one not enough of the other
122070 the confessional self analysis in the first person which is now common its difficult though not impossible for it to enter myth
122071 philosopher in the shed masses of papers he wanted his philosophy published
122072 ive got a friend in melbourne whos a sort of francophile but hes never left australia hes hardly left melbourne hes like a gerald murnane the writer who dislikes travel and i was going to leave him some money on condition he went overseas but knowing him he wouldnt have taken the money
122073 was very good for me psychologically in a literary sense
122074 its probably like most things from my terrible methodist upbringing in adelaide
122075 that upbringing simplifies things to a terrible extent and most of my time since having left the place and methodism has been spent trying to overcome it not quite successfully
122076 they have quite good virtues as well a plain modesty which i have in spades of course
122077 im quite interested in women more than i used to be
122078 im interested in the way they carry on theres this mixture of the sympathetic and the soft and the sudden shift
122079 its a bit like trying to understand music isnt it
122080 so it was like looking at her through a godfrey miller painting or a tennis racquet
122081 a very very kind woman a natural kindness not constructed
122082 i like seeing friends more and more i like drinking red wine i really like red wine good red wine
122083 the tower headland will provide something we have never had in blackpool before
122084 we are currently in the position that we cannot hold some major events and performances as we dont have appropriate outdoor space available
122085 not only will the headland play host to the biggest events blackpool has ever seen it will also provide a fantastic opportunity for community groups and schools to put on smaller performances
122086 we are grateful to the court for its ruling which makes it clear that lucasfilm and george lucas are the rightful owners of the copyrights related to star wars
122087 we do not intend to use this ruling to discourage our fans from expressing their imagination creativity and passion for star wars through the costumes and props they make for their personal use rather we see the courts decision as reaffirming that those who seek to illegally profit from star wars will be brought to task wherever they may be

122091 gaas component demand is skewed towards mmic solutions with some limited demand for discretes as well
122092 despite the increase in unit demand asp pressures will mean the market for gaas devices will be effectively flat over 2008 and 2009
122093 while strategy analytics believes that asps will hold up better than previously forecast gaas device manufacturers targeting this market such as triquint and avago technologies in north america toshiba and mitsubishi electric in japan and ums in europe will need to optimize their supply relationships to maintain margins in this competitive market
122094 in a circle with seven operators keen to bid for 3g spectrum blocks in the 2 1 ghz band the reserve price ought to be at least rs 100 crore per 5 mhz block of spectrum
122095 in line with previous analysis wireless infrastructure satellite and dbs markets will drive demand for gaas discretes though the overall market will show only a 1 caagr from 2007 to 2012
122096 meanwhile the market for digital gaas ics actually showed year on year growth for the first time in several years as a result of demand from the 10gbps gigabit per second fiber optic markets

122131 hes got the no 9 hitter up and grady sizemore on deck and he throws him a 3 2 breaking ball
122132 thats not acceptable i dont have a problem with the home run but what happened before that was not excusable
122133 i cant get too upset about that the stuff that happened before that when i hit a guy and walked a guy is what im upset about

122140 we have some good leads that we are following up on
122141 casual dining is declining and people are buying more from the grocery store and thats benefiting us the cereal industry seems to have picked up due to changing habits due to the economy
122142 this cereal growth is the strongest weve seen in a number of years and its an indication that we are seeing more and more people go to the grocery store for food
122143 going against our very strong first half performance in 2007
122144 given the tough comparables were very pleased with our q2 performance
122145 our belief is to keep the brand vital and exciting to consumers
122146 and new product innovation is one of the tools to do that
122147 construction is being done on the parking structure and things are progressing quite rapidly
122148 we expect to be complete in the third quarter of 2009
122149 officers established the incident occurred at approximately 10 20pm on tuesday evening
122150 the alleged suspect a 22 year old male was spoken to by police
122151 its important to make a government that tackles reforms with the goal of improving and encouraging peoples lives but remains gentle for the less privileged in society
122152 what people really want is a fundamental political change a change in policies something more substantial
122153 nadie es capaz de evitar el amor y tampoco de evitar que el amor acabe
122154 it will just be good to see this group thrive
122155 weve worked hard at it weve made some great strides it would be good to get that confirmation that we have made progress tomorrow night
122156 i suspect this weekend could be a grind it could be ugly but it will be intense and there will be drama
122157 we are all proud and we are happy to see our king crowned and we wish he will lead us to a new life and a new prosperity
122158 we have about 40 000 genes in every cell and the main reason a brain cell is a brain cell is because only a small fraction of the genes are turned on the remaining genes that are not expressed are shut down by an epigenetic process called dna methylation
122159 interestingly the nature of this chemical modification is long term and hard to reverse and this fits with depression
122160 the whole idea that the genome is so malleable in the brain is surprising finding that epigenetic mechanisms continue to influence gene expression is pretty unusual
122161 these observations open an entirely new avenue of research and potential therapeutic interventions
122162 it is sending a clear message that he fukuda wants to win the election with aso
122163 the situation is not one in which the ldp can win under aso its only a bit of a plus
122164 its no secret that aso is quite hostile towards china a member of the pro taiwan lobby he has ruffled feathers in a number of ways
122165 if they win the election fukuda stays and if they lose aso has to quit too
122166 we are hearing voices i believe those inside the rubble will be saved
122167 there now appears to be a degree of durability in gains
122168 nobody is going to trust the north korean number they have given on plutonium they made
122169 the ball is in the north korean court and we will see what they come up with
122170 in the battle of iraq the united states and our allies have prevailed
122171 four passengers have sustained injuries the cause of the fire is under investigation
122172 the ticket checking staff noticed the fire and alerted the driver and guards who stopped the train
122173 the fire spread to the other coaches due to wind
122174 doing the best we can to do our part to take care of the environment
122175 at the same time we know that the deities want us to take care of ourselves to stand on our own two feet as individuals as families as a community as a nation
122176 epa is bending to the will of corporate financial and misguided political interests that will pollute new mexicos skies
122177 epas decision ignores its obligations to protect the health of residents and the environment in new mexico and the region we will not allow this ill advised decision to stand
122178 it is a devastating blow to tribal members who continually suffer from the large coal complex encroaching upon our land
122179 this one massive plant will negate the emissions reductions being implemented by the northeastern states in the first mandatory regional program to cut global warming pollution
122180 the administrations shameful decision rewards polluters flouts the clean air act and fails the american people
122181 this is an old charge that karadzic started in 1996 such a deal would have been immoral and unethical it obviously didnt happen
122182 ambassador holbrooke and we have repeatedly made clear that no agreement was ever made in which radovan karadzic was provided immunity from prosecution or arrest
122183 and in order to explain this to his own people he put the story out then and he has embroidered it over 12 years but there is zero truth to it
122184 if holbrooke still wants my death and regrets there is no death sentence at this court i want to know if his arm is long enough to reach me here
122185 what i said was that i know that the hague does not have a death penalty but if anybody deserves the death penalty its radovan karadzic because he was responsible directly or indirectly for 300 000 deaths
122186 the current dream of the chinese people is to accelerate building a modern country realise the great renaissance of the chinese nation and with the peoples of the world seek peaceful progress amicable co existence and harmonious development
122187 when political arrests end in the west bank everything else will come to an end
122188 constitute the destruction of any palestinian and arab call to end the schism

122202 we believe it is very important to service local markets with local people
122203 it is so scary it makes me remember the shells landing here and there the ground shaking and ear splitting artillery explosions
122204 if it flares up we will be sitting ducks like we were before the ceasefire
122205 i pray sanity prevails on both armies and they dont turn again our villages into a firing ranges
122206 i dont see or feel any tension here we are all relaxed
122207 there is nothing serious i am sure the recent firing was aimed to give cover to terrorists
122208 we have successfully foiled major bids of infiltration and that has helped us a lot
122209 the numbers are enough for us to carry through the legislation we would like to clear all this in the next session
122210 there is a comprehensive legislation prepared including a plan to raise the fdi limit to 49 percent to get more investment in the insurance sector where the potential is immense and there is low penetration
122211 some impact has been felt of the rbis measures on banks profitability when they did not pass on the increased costs but they are in a position to take that
122212 the expectations are there will be a good crop we hope it will have a sobering impact on prices
122213 we would like to see it strike a balance where the interest of the exporters and the importers is balanced

122216 more than ten lack students appear for engineering entrance examinations every year many of them are from tier ii cities these students move to nearby cities in the quest of better coaching thus spending a lot of money whereas bigger cities have problems of traffic congestion and increasing distances in the present scenario online learning is the best option as it provides access to the best teachers to students from the comfort of their homes

122228 we created the comodo forum hoping it would evolve into a strong knit community that consisted of both our customers and others interested in online security
122229 it now attracts a diverse community including some of the brightest minds in our industry i am deeply gratified to see how community members actively support each other to help manage the every day issues people have in staying safe online this level of passionate commitment has become an integral part of comodos approach to our development across our entire business
122230 we tried to look for ideas in every choice that we make in our homes hoping that everyone who goes through it will be inspired to make some change on some level
122231 some people will walk away and want to do an entire new home or some people will think when they go for their towels next and go for organic linens
122232 it is happening but the industry needs to do a better job of getting information into peoples hands when theyre looking for it
122233 i like not making a negative impact on the earth
122234 its got so much to be said for it because it uses nature and natural materials
122235 its open you bring the outside in and you can even bring the inside out its a house built for humans its plausible in real life
122236 the impression that green building has to be modern weird solar ugly
122237 one of the things thats fundamental to green building is that it can look like anything it can be a regular craftsman house or a cape cod house in new england or an adobe house in santa fe you dont have to change what the home looks like to make it green
122238 but we hope people will make informed decisions when theyre building when theyre renovating
122239 at the end of the day there is an order that mr ainsworth infringed our copyright and the next stage of the case will be discussing remedies for that
122240 he must have been crazy what can you really do
122241 doesnt matter to me as long as hes not going to be out on the street
122242 the doctors concluded that mr popal did not know the nature or consequences of his behavior
122243 it is consistent with our strategy to focus on specialty areas of high unmet need
122244 its not as good as wed like it to be but i want to remind you a few months ago there were predictions that the economy would shrink this quarter
122245 but say it doesnt were still under a lot of pressure to get a park that is our own that isnt going to go away so my hope is that well find a way to make it happen it has not been as easy as i thought it would be
122246 to lew i think it seems like theyre delaying things
122247 in lews mind i think he thinks theyre not being entirely reasonable im not super worried but im concerned i think its important that we get the issues resolved so that we can move forward
122248 but the problem is we cant give them exactly what they want
122249 i heard the dogs barking and a lot of screaming and then all of a sudden it stopped
122250 the kids came over banging on the door saying their house was on fire and i said where is your mother
122251 i was always telling her what was she doing with him i didnt really like him he didnt have a job or a car
122252 she was saying she was dying and moaning somebody call 911 somebody talk to me she then just laid down
122253 she was very nice very quiet paid her rent on time
122254 there is nothing drastic out of this audit like something horrible is happening
122255 but we need to know where every nickel is spent
122256 so many times you hear that vta is going bankrupt
122257 no were not going bankrupt were financially stable were moving in the right direction
122258 i always felt the revenue projections were so loose they would flop around and were tied to the political environment you cannot allow that to happen and have the public trust you
122259 the fact that it melted at zero degrees centigrade leaves very little doubt
122260 this is not a condition that kills you acutely it is a condition that erodes your health over time
122261 we are committed to honoring the group that is elected by our employees
122262 means what it says a civil action for damages against the university is available only when the plaintiff employee has first filed a complaint with the university and the university has failed to reach a timely decision on the complaint
122263 act powerfully to defeat the purposes of the whistleblower protection act
122264 the parties agreed four years ago to stop spending taxpayer money on housing youth in hurtful illegal conditions
122265 its fair to conclude that the defense is substantially out of compliance very very serious problems continue to exist at the states juvenile detention facilities
122266 when i got out i was like a baby my whole thought process had to be restructured
122267 with over a quarter of a million dollars per ward why cant you build new facilities
122268 if were spending that much money which is by any measure extraordinary why isnt it clearer in these hearings what the impediments were why hasnt there been more progress
122269 my husband makes a decent living but to live in santa clara valley it takes over 100 000
122270 the rising phenomenon of men using cats and dogs to make passes at women and pester families
122271 if a man is caught with a pet the pet will be immediately confiscated and the man will be forced to sign a document pledging not to repeat the act
122272 with all due respect to you personally i will defend myself before this institution as i would defend myself before any natural catastrophe
122273 this puts many projects on hold just when we were building a wind manufacturing infrastructure in this country
122274 its deeply disappointing and hard to fathom that congress cant get this done especially when 90 percent of congress supports this
122275 but the dynamic is different this year because of the presidential election
122276 we dont want to get swallowed up in the issues between the two parties
122277 at the same time for some people hair loss can be a really traumatic thing especially for women
122278 its a little bit like a free lunch without the calories
122279 the fact you can mimic exercise is a big advantage because diet and exercise are the pillars of diabetes treatment
122280 it is possible that the couch potato segment of the population might find this to be a good regimen and of course that is a large number of people
122281 she is saying we are going take no prisoners and try and beat this back before it qualifies
122282 there may well be people who think madison nguyen is not the right person but the time to make that decision is at the next election
122283 this legislation will create a higher education system that is more affordable fairer and easier to navigate for students and families
122284 we take this stuff so seriously which is why we are trying to prosecute this guy to the full extent of the law
122285 when our officers got there one of them found him at the rear of the high school on foot no vehicle no dog no luggage
122286 he kind of looked blank there was no look of fear or concern
122287 i have a real one from italy and i knew there were no cane corso breeders in the nine county bay area
122288 i looked at his dogs and said those are neopolitans bred with pit bulls
122289 made me run my shoes through a little bucket of clorox he said he didnt want his dogs to get infected from human bacteria the whole place was full of feces
122290 he kept telling me he was breeding the macho dog that would be more powerful than pit bulls and be great for dog fights or guide dogs
122291 from the outset i thought it was a little strange because he asked me to bring him dog food out of my pocket
122292 he brought me to the back of his property and said oh yeah i have these two males cane corsos they were in an 8 foot by 8 foot kennel filled with feces and the dogs should have weighed 110 pounds they weighed 45 pounds and had no hair on their bodies you could see their spinal cords
122293 the key mission for the united states looking forward is to maintain the cease fires and prevent people from going back to the warpath
122294 their purpose in iraq is increasingly changing from fighting a war to keeping a peace
122295 im very pleased with how well the obama people are getting their people out
122296 i have stood on stage with him in 22 debates but whos counting
122297 i have seen his passion and determination his grace and his grit his own life exemplifies the american dream
122298 but now it is time for us to unite and together stand up and say no more of the republican ideology
122299 i respect his many accomplishments my differences with him are not personal
122300 they are with the policies he has proposed because while he legitimately can tout moments of independence from his party in the past such independence isnt characteristic of his presidential campaign
122301 so she can partially forgive me for not supporting her losing candidate
122302 all of us are on the same team again everyone has worked hard on the clinton event
122303 and on the flip side for obamas august 17 event the clinton people are pulling through
122304 its good you should read it go and buy it
122305 but at the same time i feel its the best not only for him but for us as a team
122306 youre getting the benefits of exercise without having to do any work
122307 the mouse doctors and cell biologists are of course quite enthusiastic about these things but the human doctors are a little more reticent
122308 it was found to be a quite safe drug at least at the doses we were using
122309 just promise one thing dont ever become a jump jockey
122310 dad believe me theres no way in the world id ever do that
122311 ill be happy when i retire to consider it a very successful career
122312 you hate to get a phone call to go see your son in the hospital
122313 when you ride a good jumper theres not a greater feeling
122314 when they meet every fence right and give you a perfect trip theres nothing more exhilarating
122315 he fully enjoys what hes doing but he doesnt have a plan of attack for the future ive been pushing for him to find one
122316 you hate to brag on your kid but he became the best of his generation
122317 thats something to be proud of much to my chagrin
122318 will the positive features of cities be great enough for seniors to overcome their other concerns about cities especially urban crime
122319 people are interested on moving back into more urban environments
122320 were very happy living in albany we love our house and this neighborhood
122321 we can walk everywhere there are about 40 restaurants nearby and lots of free music and cultural activities
122322 its so sheltered and quiet in the backyard that you dont realize youre in the heart of the city
122323 urban was a dirty word 10 years ago but it really isnt anymore
122324 were still battling a fear factor and white flight but empty nesters and the younger generation are moving into the city with a great deal of enthusiasm im seeing a revival
122325 i dont think anyone has behaved differently i think some guys have to become a little more vocal and still be comfortable in what they are doing
122326 ap middle linebacker antonio pierce is definitely the guy we look to fill that kind of void honestly i dont know if that void needs to be filled we have a lot of veterans on this team
122327 i dont feel any pressure we have a lot of good personnel on the football field
122328 who wants to have their salaries revealed to the world
122329 so much of what they do is about denigrating public service
122330 lifts the veil of secrecy that too often covers state government
122331 the tremendous amount of thinking and work that clearly went into the site make it a model for state and local governments to follow
122332 more than six years ago americas catholic bishops promised to be open and transparent about child sex crimes and cover ups
122333 yet the albany and ogdensburg parishioners and the public have been told nothing about fr carl stone
122334 the albany diocese was not aware until publication of a recent canadian newspaper story that he apparently functioned as a priest in a limited ministry in cornwall ontario for a period of time after leaving albany
122335 i was trying to take every precaution to give this man a chance
122336 wed like to get additional troops there as soon as we could
122337 im coming to china as the president and as a friend
122338 i know its best for the u s china relationship that i go
122339 by arranging such a meeting between its leader and these people and making irresponsible remarks on chinas human rights and religious situation the u s side has rudely interfered in chinas internal affairs and sent a seriously wrong message to the anti china hostile forces
122340 this is not a complex case and it should move quickly
122341 they have had a lot of time during the grand jury investigation to be preparing
122342 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
122343 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
122344 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
122345 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
122346 from obamas repeated suggestion that hes running a racist campaign
122347 when he did it the first time yesterday we let it pass when he did it again later specifically linking us to it we decided to respond
122348 this decision should send a clear signal to the bush administration that it must cooperate fully with congress and that former administration officials harriet miers and karl rove must testify before congress
122349 that said these statistics are still teaching us things and we need to constantly be looking at how we use force
122350 i am pleasantly surprised at the low number of times the officers used force
122351 we need to remember that the chief is doing this so he can see if there are areas to improve in
122352 he is doing that on his own initiative and i appreciate that
122353 this is the police department making its own best case and it is self serving and one sided as one would expect
122354 if i were chief of police in san jose and i heard my officers never used deadly force once it would be a headline
122355 we need to equip our filmmakers with the tools that will enable them to tell african stories from an african perspective
122356 film and the audiovisual media can play a great role in transforming the societies we live in the way we think and perceive ourselves has a direct impact on how we relate to ourselves and others today we have this amazing technology in the form of film and television which we can use as the modern african fire
122357 we are ready as a government to lend our support to the efforts of fepaci and the african union to ensure that we change the image of africa at home and abroad for the better i belief that as long as we do not make films projecting homegrown images we will remain an industry dependent on others
122358 we need to create a new generation of african filmmakers because presently the current ones are working under very difficult circumstances at the same time measures and policies need to be put in place to prevent exploitation of our cultural heritage something that can become a currency to sustain ourselves
122359 seemed like a good idea at the time but am thinking about moving over to the prius very seriously right now
122360 any device capable of storing information in digital or analog form
122361 written materials commonly referred to as pocket trash or pocket litter
122362 theyre saying they can rifle through all the information in a travelers laptop without having a smidgen of evidence that the traveler is breaking the law
122363 dont establish any criteria for whose computer can be searched
122364 plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border without probable cause or a warrant
122365 our state faces a looming cash crisis this situation leaves me with no easy choices
122366 this is not an action that i take lightly i understand that this will affect people at a time when they are already struggling and so i want to apologize to all the state employees for having to do that
122367 the whole place was packed with people trying to figure out how to get served
122368 go ahead were all getting laid off or minimum wage
122369 our workers have received mixed messages from their supervisors about which employees will be exempt and which employees will not be exempt
122370 he cant force us to do anything different than were already doing
122371 he is under pressure and were all under pressure thats why i dont understand why this distraction was needed
122372 its still early but certainly we are pleased by where were at at this stage of the campaign
122373 if we had more money to give them we would
122374 we want to keep marriage defined as one man and one woman throughout the nation
122375 i think we have to spend more than they do
122376 i dont think we have to spend a lot more but i think we have to spend more than they do and were completely capable of raising that
122377 and nothing is in stone yet so i still have a chance to change my mind
122378 i pounded on him then hurt my right hand then my left
122379 i was hurt but i refused to quit i went the full 12 rounds
122380 destroy judah way worse than how cotto did it last year
122381 known to cause cancer birth defects and other reproductive harm
122382 he has now brought on his staff people that are very competent modelers
122383 without that expertise on his own staff the state engineer was limited with respect to what the models were telling him
122384 the first time i have really seen him take cognizance of the model was in the cave dry lake and delamar decision
122385 we have the staffing software programs are better time has passed so there is more data on water levels and spring flows its definitely changed the way we can look at those issues
122386 it concerns me that everyone starts to think that the model is going to tell you exactly what is going to happen
122387 here we are trying to decide whether to allow that pumping and so you have to make a best guess
122388 if youre looking at a spring on the surface thats an academic difference
122389 weve struggled every legislative session to find adequate funding for k 12
122390 it has been the governors policy that the ultimate authority in state government is the people
122391 only pays lip service to the public input portion of the process it just seems like an anomalous process for soliciting public comment on what purports to be a major study
122392 propose recommendations by which greenhouse gas emissions can be further reduced in nevada
122393 whether the governor actually uses the public comments or not is an open question
122394 there is nothing saying that he will go with the recommendations of the committee either
122395 will likely take a more aggressive position than some of the recommendations in the committee report
122396 i consider the lack of enthusiasm in seeking comments to be minor compared to the total lack of commitment to actually doing anything useful to mitigate climate change
122397 the report is essentially validating the status quo saying the course nevada is on is ok
122398 its going to take money and action and a cheerleader other states have a cheerleader in their governors and we dont
122399 people were waiting in line for four or five hours they were fainting out front it was really bad
122400 this will be the biggest wedding day of the year far surpassing valentines day
122401 or at least until i get a viagra endorsement and make so much money i can quit the music biz and go into acting
122402 i felt like if youre going to clean something it really should be clean
122403 but i had seven children i wanted to go on home i told him im not staying these arent slavery times anymore he said i had to stay i walked
122404 one day we decided to march on the welfare office we asked to see their policies their manual of how they would treat us they said the state couldnt do that so we went up the back steps on a friday afternoon went into the directors office and told him we wouldnt let him leave
122405 storming caesars palace how black mothers fought their own war on poverty
122406 finally we understand that the civil rights movement was a lot bigger and longer than martin luther king as wonderful and important as he was
122407 there are so many levels on which this movement was important not only statewide but nationwide
122408 and theres no question ruby was in the absolute forefront
122409 as long as they graduated and walked across that stage that was enough
122410 it was exciting to see how poor people could stand up
122411 just the way she looked you could feel her power it was so uplifting
122412 im glad shes finally being recognized for all that shes done
122413 so many people give up homes so many jobless people
122414 let somebody make me wealthy before i leave just for one year
122415 i would buy me a nice home in a decent neighborhood i would have me a better car i would love to go to one of those hotels lay up and have a massage i would go to paris london italy i would live for once in my life
122416 weve found over the years it doesnt really matter how you or i might view the seriousness of an assault because everybody processes it or reacts to sexual assault differently
122417 somebody might think this is the worst thing that has ever happened to them and indeed it may be
122418 we know only one in 10 sexual assaults are reported
122419 i did not attend school i am learning to read now in prison
122420 and so addicted to vomiting that he suffers from potential heart failure and has lost quite a few of his teeth ive begged farley to get help but hed rather give me up than attend even one 12 step meeting
122421 you need to find people who can help you learn to help yourself
122422 intentional joy how to turn stress fear amp addiction into freedom
122423 farley is not only starving his body but his brain i believe the best solution would be for him to attend an inpatient eating disorder program he can google treatment programs in his area call them up and ask if they have a free or reduced cost bed
122424 there may not be a greater agony than watching someone you love slowly kill themselves and refuse to seek help
122425 when it comes to pregnancy and to parenthood men can be like deer in the headlights
122426 we end up scratching our heads and not having a clue what to do so many parenting guides are written from the womans perspective that fathers are made to feel like neanderthals
122427 we were going to talk about nutritional requirements and how a guy could take over the reins of the kitchen while his pregnant partner is uncomfortable and not into making meals
122428 somewhere along the way we decided to turn it into a full blown pregnancy book
122429 the book is meant to be engaging and to deliver information in bite sized pieces so that a guy can read a little bit doze off and pick it up the next day
122430 a book for fathers needs to be humorous and engaging from what folks tell me the book is funny and guys really do enjoy reading it
122431 it suggests that in contemporary america people use consumer purchases to compensate for psychological states of insecurity

122437 then we better get after finding some supplies of oil and gas
122438 since the 19th century we in the west have been trying to extract oil from the vast oil shale riches that lie under our feet it s no easy task and past efforts have failed miserably commercial oil shale development would require not only immense financial investments but also an undetermined quantity of scarce water from the colorado river basin and the construction of several multibillion dollar power plants
122439 neither side wants to show that it is losing face or that it is caving in or appeasing the other side but both sides are interested in finding a way out of this conundrum
122440 the iranian reply should come in the next few days

122449 we have the opportunity we have the talent and certainly now we have the corporate sponsorship at the moment there is absolutely no excuse for the athletes in our country and i am not talking specifically only about beijing
122450 among the 57 athletes i think our best chances in beijing are in shooting and archery but it is important that we perform well as underdogs

122463 we are heartbroken and devastated that christopher has been taken from us so suddenly
122464 he was a much loved son brother father and uncle and we are all going to miss him
122465 christopher had been living with our mother patricia lindsay and she is inconsolable
122466 the last time our mother saw him was just a few hours before he was so cruelly taken from her and at that time he was in good health and good spirits
122467 she cannot comprehend what has happened particularly as in recent times he had been making efforts to turn his life around
122468 this device must not be sold to or used by a member of the general public
122469 when i found out roxy was going to be pregnant i made sure they didnt turn her all frumpy
122470 theres no way she would change her style just because shes expecting and she wont be one of those pushchair mums
122471 when i had my twins my life didnt change that much i just took the girls with me everywhere i went
122472 i want roxy to be the same i want her to embrace being a mum not let it change her
122473 will hasnt always had an easy time hes been romantically involved with both pc honey harman and pc emma keane with disastrous consequences
122474 moving over to cid is a chance to put all that behind him and he cant be faulted for his eagerness
122475 he makes every effort to impress the team lets just hope it works out
122476 this storyline is very ugly indeed and could clearly be very upsetting to watch
122477 i watched the scraggy bitch laugh as she stuck the boot in to abis face and then laugh again when we had to release her

122484 i lost weight the old fashioned way through dancing and exercise

122487 in this environment management no longer seems comfortable enough to increase the share buyback or increase the dividend in our view
122488 business conditions for the automobile industry deteriorated sharply again in the second quarter due to further ongoing steep rises in oil and raw material prices the weakness of the u s dollar the impact of the international financial crisis and a weaker u s economy
122489 we assume that 2009 will be another difficult year full of challenges
122490 shameful dark side of the games that we cannot change
122491 the ioc coordination commission and bocog met last night and agreed internet use will be just like in any olympics
122492 we put a team together in the ioc to work with bocog to begin to open up sites which we believe are absolutely necessary to comply with non censored reporting of the games
122493 there will be sites blocked that have to do with pornography or where in the opinion of the national government are sites which are subversive or against national interest and thats normal in most countries in the world
122494 try something new and you may have to feel funny before you can have any fun
122495 there are many ways to grow as a musician not to mention as a human being so far this weekend ive learned the importance of patience gratitude humility resilience and above all listening
122496 my talented companions come in on the chorus with harmony as beautiful as ive ever heard when i die hallelujah by and by we sing as we play our hearts out ill fly away
122497 the articles prominent placement in such a popular publication is a victory for bluegrass as well as encouragement for all kinds of closet pickers out there
122498 they even included a photo of the author waving his mandolin now eighty million readers around the world are getting a taste of the power of bluegrass

122502 the quality of preparation the readiness of the venues and the attention to operational detail for these games have set a gold standard for the future
122503 knowing we were so close makes us realize how good we can be
122504 were definitely moving the football program in the right direction
122505 we need more depth talent and speed but were moving in the right direction
122506 but one guy isnt going to be enough at any position for us to be any good
122507 weve got to find at least one or two other kids at running back that can come in that can give him a blow and change of pace maybe somebody that brings a little different element to the game than greg does
122508 but the accuracy factor is going to be more important than anything
122509 making sure that we make all the extra points and all the reasonable field goal attempts
122510 my commitment was to withdraw from public life and not to endanger in any way the implementation of the dayton agreement to withdraw even from literary life and any form of public life
122511 this is a matter of life and death if mr holbrooke wants to have me dead and if his arm is so very long then i want to know if his arm can also reach me here
122512 mr karadzic apparently you want to bring to the attention of this chamber that some agreement apparently between persons attached to states were made
122513 of course the chamber is not aware of any such agreements if you want to raise this issue then of course it would be important for us to then have the full facts
122514 i have an invisible legal adviser but i have decided to defend myself on my own
122515 i am not interested in having someone else read the indictment to me
122516 i would rather receive the new indictment that has been announced and have sufficient time to study it and then have my initial appearance for that and enter my plea
122517 it is obviously not going to be very short but i suspect that the evidence against karadzic which is more focused geographically and time wise than the evidence on milosevic and that may include evidence that is in a sense stronger than the evidence that was available for the milosevic case
122518 it shouldnt be anything like as long as the milosevic trial the difficulty of course may be in the judges managing of karadzic if he chooses as was said on his behalf to represent himself
122519 to prolong the trial by spending time on irrelevant matters it may also be the case that the judges will now be well equipped to deal with that and to shut him down and to keep the trial to strictly legal issues
122520 enjoy his life as there was nothing to stop him now an inquest heard today
122521 i know what to do now for the best and was signed with a kiss

122533 we made it here in our great big echoey corporate kitchens while baking four and twenty chicken breasts in a pie and doing gordon ramsey impressions
122534 we are very proud of his majesty he was under pressure to change and he has
122535 in fact he has done more than we could have hoped for
122536 the beijing olympics will create new british heroes to inspire young people to take up sport
122537 the biggest misconception is that women can have orgasms through intercourse but 70 percent of women dont and thats totally normal guys dont just lie back hoping to have an orgasm they pick a thrusting style to suit them women need to do the same and take control
122538 the trick to achieving orgasm is to put pressure on your clitoris by rotating your pelvis during sex
122539 good positions for this are with the woman on top or with the man behind and if you tighten your pelvic muscles your orgasm will be more intense
122540 these positions are also great for hitting the g spot which is around the urethra tissue the part you can feel through the vaginal wall its not miles in like we all previously thought
122541 another good orgasm tip is to give up on trying to climax simultaneously
122542 much better to take it in turns so youre not distracted by what the other person is doing thats why a 69er is always better in fantasy
122543 and stop thinking of sex having a start middle and end you could orgasm from an oral sex session or a quickie against the bathroom wall
122544 keep your mind in the moment and feel rather than think it will make climaxing much easier if you want more than one orgasm my best tip is to use different forms of stimulation otherwise you get de sensitised so orgasm through oral sex then through your g spot
122545 remember having sex when youre drunk means your senses are dulled and your orgasm wont be as good
122546 the key to having a great orgasm is to get your mind in orgasm mode way before you take your clothes off
122547 all orgasms are great thinking of them as brilliant or boring just puts pressure on us the trick is not to strive for something better we all feel orgasms in different ways my advice is to set aside time to explore orgasms on your own its rare to be unable to orgasm through masturbation
122548 a lot of women think its cheating to do it in a relationship but its not it helps you know what you like then why not try masturbating in front of your partner if you feel embarrassed then ask him to do it first
122549 breathing can really affect an orgasm as you start having sex your breathing rate increases and we often hold our breath this means you tense up and climaxing is more difficult if youre aware of your breathing and try to regulate it youll let go quicker and orgasm
122550 well it worked out last time so lets give it another go
122551 civil union legislation comes in different forms and i would like to be able to see it im sure i would be able to make an intelligent decision once i see it but civil unions come in different forms in different states
122552 im really honored and appreciative of the support ive had from the gay community over my entire photo by ap
122553 not that weve always agreed on everything in fact there have been times we have disagreed but ive always had the support of this community and im appreciative of that
122554 the turnout in february for the presidential primary was high but the july 15 primaries were lower than last time
122555 people will turn up to vote they just have to have something that interests them
122556 unfortunately in our laws marriage is recognized so there needs to be some device i believe civil unions is the best device to give equal protection to those who do not have possibility of a marriage service available to them
122557 i think its a state issue to be honest with you i dont think the federal government should have gotten involved in the first place
122558 certainly i think a constitutional amendment defending marriage would be inappropriate
122559 we ought to make sure that there is no discrimination based on sexual identity or gender identity
122560 i do believe that you have to get some legislation passed i am not so dogmatic i believe i can win everything but i am committed to making sure everyones rights are protected
122561 it was a mistake military service is an important patriotic duty of all americans and it shouldnt be denied anyone for discriminatory reasons
122562 i oppose all forms of hate crimes based on sexual orientation
122563 laws should be strong on the national and state level and should prohibit that behavior and punish it
122564 people should be able to offer benefits to whomever they wish
122565 not only would i like to see it happen these sorts of things are what i worked on in the georgia legislature for years
122566 the principle is consistent with jims views that recognized same sex partnerships should be afforded the same rights and privileges as married spouses
122567 stan watson has always voted the right way on our issues its just that burrell really pursued gay support and for that reason we endorsed him
122568 w e have kind of cross section of people in the audience now
122569 i wrote shes got to be and bus bus around the same time and realized i wanted to treat these songs different rather than just go rock out
122570 i really wanted to have a vision work on the rhythm section and musicality in earlier records i was just getting my ideas out and finding my way
122571 he is incredibly talented he wouldnt let me be lazy
122572 i think sometimes i would settle because i liked the lyrics so much not stretch it more
122573 its a song about love and forgiveness and compassion and how to take the high road in any situation
122574 i realized i struggled with that on the whole record what does it mean to have an ally what does it mean to have anger and to be alienated from someone or to try to have compassion for someone who does things that are really bad or violent
122575 didnt it feel kinder is for people to think about and fill in the blank as to what feels kinder
122576 my feeling is didnt it feel kinder when you let love abide
122577 at my brothers wedding there were like 120 people all relatives at the rehearsal dinner
122578 they raised their daughters to be independent women and theyre probably regretting it thinking oh no theyre so independent
122579 but they raised all of us to be engaged in community not just the republican community
122580 later on i met people who grew up in north atlanta who were gay and were punk rock goth and it was articulated but that just wasnt talked about in my scene
122581 little five points was my scene thats where i met the trans crowd punks poets political people and at the same time there were families
122582 we are looking into the possibility of it being a hate crime
122583 we do have the death penalty of course thats up to the district attorney
122584 we have always been out there as far as civil rights gay and lesbian rights since the beginning
122585 weve had an outpouring of support from the entire country people of faith people without faith its just been tremendous
122586 we had a service monday night that over 1 000 people attended first baptist church downtown held a service for us the other churches have just been great
122587 there is definitely that feeling among the leaders of some of the gay community groups in town we havent gotten a lot of guidance about it other than some partial quotes and neighbors opinions as to why he did it
122588 in nashville its pretty good in memphis its decent and it tends to drop off after that
122589 we do have trauma counselors on hand this week and probably for awhile to come sadly
122590 i understand the history of this race i take nothing away from that but this is my home
122591 there are eight foreclosures on my street we have to work to improve our neighborhood
122592 we have been going door to door every day to get the message to vote out weve put out mailers done phone bank actually i decided to stop phone banking because it was starting to be too much
122593 i really think the lgbt community really can make a difference in keishas race if only 10 percent of the electorate come out to vote and lgbt voters come out in force than they can swing the election
122594 ive talked to him extensively on issues like predatory lending funding for grady gay issues hell be gay friendly
122595 i think well be simpatico i think hell have his own agenda of course but on core progressive issues i think hell be right there with me and the voters of his district
122596 to be honest i dont care about winning if im elected and cant do anything to help the district
122597 id rather not have it if thats the case the conditions were deplorable at that tent city we need to do something to help
122598 as backpack in the park celebrates its third anniversary the biggest change is location and were very excited about being in grant park

122600 part of our mission is bridging communities so it was actually a perfect fit to travel to a neighborhood a bit south of midtown
122601 we are confident that we will reach a new audience while keeping our core constituency
122602 we hope that with two years under our collective belts that this years event will be bigger and better
122603 one of our themes this year is that the children in need in our community need help now more than ever we look forward to our community coming together and showing its generosity
122604 everybodys suffering in this economy and so this allows the kids to start school with all the supplies that they need to help them be successful so they dont have to feel inadequate or less than
122605 many newly formed organizations find the five year mark to be significant in development planning strategy etc the first five years were expertly run by the founding board with a very foundation building focus and what an incredible foundation they built now we are fine tuning our operation putting more systems in place and looking to the future for the type of growth we want to tackle
122606 after a particularly difficult start to the quarter with the accident at the south deep gold mine in which nine of our colleagues tragically lost their lives the people of gold fields rallied together to show their mettle
122607 galvanised by my statement that we will not mine if we cannot mine safely they took control of the safety situation on all of our mines where a new safety culture is rapidly taking root

122618 there have been several attempts to locate him since then and new information shows us that he has apparently fled the country
122619 if rodriguez had gotten arrested he still wouldve been out in 20 minutes on bail

122626 the orphan works bill has the potential to erode the protection that copyright owners have fought for over many years
122627 it puts the burden on the copyright owner to find the offending parties and either negotiate with them without the remedies currently available to bring about reasonable compensation or bring costly litigation in short for copyright owners the orphan works bill is a disaster
122628 the original premise of this legislation was to protect libraries museums and other not for profit users in efforts to digitize archives of materials for which owners could not be located however as drafted the legislation goes much further it applies to any use of a copyrighted work in short it creates an incentive to steal first and pay later if caught policing infringing uses on the internet is already difficult this raises the bar and places the burden on copyright owners to locate infringers of their works at the same time threatening to wipe out 100 years of legal protection under u s law
122629 the internet computer and consumer electronics industries utilize vast amounts of copyrighted works to attract customers to their websites from which they derive enormous profits from advertising and subscription fees these industries have long sought to eliminate copyright protection and to avoid paying for the content they use to lure consumers at the same time companies such as google and other computer related interests have provided more than million dollars to the library of congress of which the u s copyright office which initiated the orphan works legislation is a part
122630 the sin of most of these people is not that they write clunky sentences although some do but that they treat their readers like idiots they deal in cliches stereotypes cheap thrills and ridiculous plots

122654 nolimits use of nlp techniques have played an important part in the continuous professional development for me and my executive team the underlying principles of nlp when facilitated and made business specific by nolimits have transformed our outlook from being problem focused to thinking differently outside the box and delivering more successful and actionable goals i thoroughly recommend the nolimits approach in translating nlp for success in your business as well as the growth of your people at a personal level
122655 nolimits business focus on nlp delivers successful results both individually and within teams
122656 nlp has allowed me the flexibility to access my own resources for exceptional results at work and at home the patterns and processes of nlp are the largest tool kit ever possible that i use to coach others in the organisation and for myself integrate them into everything you do set well formed outcomes for the future and live up to your own personal mastery if you have the opportunity to do this programme go for it
122657 nlp has had significant impact on my personal and work life in particular it has provided me with a framework and a variety of easily applicable tools that has enhanced my personal effectiveness indeed nlps applications are limited only by ones attitude and imagination the pre suppositions of nlp as well as basic techniques like anchoring for example have tremendous potential and applications

122659 aceh has made enormous strides towards recovering from the tsunami
122660 but two years after the tsunami struck the poorest acehnese squatters renters and women are still facing a crisis over when and where they will be resettled
122661 the lack of a clear policy for landless people has led to a huge amount of uncertainty and delay theres a risk these people will end up in the slums of the future despite the huge amounts generously given after the tsunami
122662 rebuilding homes without knowing who owns the land could create problems in the future
122663 but this can be a desperately difficult and slow process oxfam has been working with tens of villages in aceh tohelp people decide how to reallocate land so everyone has somewhere to live
122664 green arrow seems to be one of the characters in the wake of this phenomenal summer book ended by iron man and the dark knight for which goyer received a story credit i know that for warner brothers green arrow is one of the characters that theyre really interested in and seem to be interested in moving forward with next
122665 it started out as a supervillain escape idea and the idea was well we can either go marvel or dc
122666 and i talked to both of them and i kind of said well who can you give me because i needed a superhero that i can bounce off of and i dont know for my money it was if we went marvel it would be captain america if we went dc maybe green arrow and green arrow seemed like the best fit
122667 green arrow is you know probably on the same level as iron man
122668 the majority of them are married and even if they were available i would not be interested i also don t think i could cope with having a relationship with someone involved in the legal sector i imagine that we would find it very hard to leave our work behind socially where does one go to meet likeminded men who are genuinely interested in a relationship as opposed to a one night stand
122669 i viewed them with suspicion assuming that they were frequented by people who either had major personality flaws or else had some ulterior seedy motive i never once stopped to think about how difficult it is in this day and age to meet suitable companions in mainstream environments of course about two years after wissarot s death when i began thinking that i didn t want to spend the rest of my life alone i realised that meeting other people was not that easy clubs and pubs really didn t appeal to me i tried going with friends to wine bars but found that i was largely on the receiving end of unwanted attention from thai men in whom i had no interest it was also obvious that the majority of them were just after a quick thrill
122670 in the waiting room i came across an article on asian online dating as i was idly perusing the obligatory stack of well thumbed thai women s magazines the article must have been particularly well written because i was instantly sold on the idea the concept of being able to peruse a database of potential suitors whilst still in my dressing gown was extremely appealing at least i knew that when i did dress up it would be because i actually had a date rather than putting a huge effort into preparing for a night cruising around social clubs with no guarantee that i was going to meet someone after my appointment i couldn t wait to get home and begin checking out some of the sites that were recommended
122671 i wasn t particularly drawn to totally free sites because i felt that they were more likely to attract members who weren t particularly serious about the process or whose intentions weren t entirely honourable i was more interested in sites that allowed you to peruse profiles but which required you to pay for full membership before allowing you to contact other members that way i knew that those i contacted were probably more serious about meeting someone special and not just after a quick fling i wanted to sign up with an asian dating site where i felt totally in control and also secure in the knowledge that none of my personal contact details would be divulged to anyone unless i specifically chose to give out this information i was also more impressed by asian dating sites that offered a range of relationship advice and articles
122672 at first i felt rather embarrassed admitting to even my closest friends that i had chosen this route but when i did i was amazed at how many of them had also considered doing the same thing one of my friends whom i assumed had met her foreign husband at the gym admitted that she had actually met him via an online message forum although this wasn t the same as an asian dating agency essentially it was no different she had found someone with whom she shared common interests but whom she had not previously met face to face and that is exactly how i began broadening my male social circle except via a dedicated relationship facility
122673 it was like being an invisible fly on the wall in a room full of interesting foreign men from all walks of life with their personal profiles attached to them i could look analyse and weigh up the options in a way that would be impossible if all those men were in one room the best part was the convenience and the fact that it didn t matter one iota what i looked like or how i behaved
122674 i also liked the idea of initially being able to build the foundations of a relationship on friendship and mutual interests before actually meeting someone and being blinded by lust which of course never lasts with the same intensity as at the beginning of a relationship
122675 i ve had tremendous fun and i d like to say that i believe i have found a relationship with future potential but you ll just have to wait and see

122680 somewhere in the wet sand below pacific palisades as the grunion ran using our steam powered digging implements we went down exactly 10 meters and here the steam powered devices really did come in handy holding back both brendan fraser and the collapsing walls of the tunnel and found an aluminized molded plywood time capsule that had been left by the eames office five decades before
122681 god grant that the reader emboldened and having become at present as fierce as what he is reading find without loss of bearings his way his wild and treacherous passage through the desolate swamps of these sombre poison soaked pages for unless he should bring to his reading a rigorous logic and a sustained mental effort at least as strong as his distrust the lethal fumes of this book shall dissolve his soul as water does sugar
122682 one should let ones nails grow for a fortnight oh how sweet it is to brutally snatch from his bed a child with no hair yet on his upper lip and with eyes wide open to pretend to suavely stroke his forehead brushing back his beautiful locks then suddenly at the moment when he least expects it to sink ones long nails into his tender breast being careful though not to kill him for if he died there would be no later viewing of his misery then one drinks the blood licking the wounds and during the entire procedure which ought to last no shorter than an aeon the boy cries nothing could be better than his blood warm and just freshly squeezed out as i have described if it werent for his tears bitter as salt
122683 i was seeking a soul resembling mine and i could not find it i searched throughout the seven seas my perseverance proved of no use yet i could not remain alone i needed someone whod approve of my nature there had to be somebody out there with the same ideas as me

122703 what he did not realize was that in the 18 months that he was making that picture america from being a pacifist nation whose popular song was i didnt raise my boy to be a soldier to kill some other darling
122704 when we received this letter saying cut down on the german atrocities we knew the war was over

122707 this is one of the most unimaginable things to actually happen to a child
122708 this woman may have given birth to the little boy but she is no mother to have done things like this
122709 this child was brave enough to tell the truth and thankfully the jury believed that truth
122710 you knew didnt you there could be no pregnancy since you had a tubal ligation and a hysterectomy years before

122713 congress should not adjourn until weve done something to bring down the high cost of gasoline
122714 i dont see how the leadership can adjourn when the folks back home are looking to us to help them with their gas prices and grocery prices they are struggling to meet their familys needs and congress should be helping them
122715 i am also an original cosponsor of the american energy act an all of the above energy strategy developed by members of the house republican conference
122716 republicans are asking for a simple up or down vote on this bill before congress adjourns
122717 none of these votes led to more domestic production but my legislation would take this decision out of the hands of congress and place it back where it belongs with the residents of the state of alaska
122718 this is much too long to leave americans hostage to the gas pumps
122719 exploting our suffering at the gas pump as an excuse to represent big oil
122720 every informed person knows there isnt enough oil in anwar to dramatically impact the price of gas
122721 the study also predicts a 2 to 6 percent decline in market share for all imported liquid petroleum products
122722 this means the price per barrel of oil would fall between only 41 cents and 1

122724 as a health care organization committed to the health and safety of our patients we have a responsibility to take a leadership role on this major health issue
122725 we have a further responsibility to treat the whole patient both mentally and physically allowing patients to use tobacco products while in our care defeats this purpose
122726 as a health care organization committed to the health and safety of our patients we have a responsibility to take a leadership role on this major health issue
122727 we have a further responsibility to treat the whole patient both mentally and physically allowing patients to use tobacco products while in our care defeats this purpose
122728 our decision to go tobacco free is not an attempt to force anyone to quit smoking
122729 rather the tobacco free initiative is a concrete way we can demonstrate our ongoing commitment to healthy living

122733 the underlying assumption is that a government of national unity already exists and mugabe sees himself as head of that government
122734 his task is straightforward to sort out the economic and political crisis and secure the lifting of sanctions
122735 it is impossible to come up with a new constitution in a space of two weeks and any constitution they the negotiators come up with which is not subjected to a popular referendum will not be acceptable to the people of zimbabwe
122736 there is nothing to be gained by calling for a government of national unity in zimbabwe when mugabe makes it clear that it can only come into existence on his terms
122737 deep fears and anxieties that mugabe might proceed to swear in parliament and appoint a new cabinet without it
122738 to me this is a sham process designed to defraud the people of zimbabwe through a fraudulent political settlement

122780 because of the huge time and effort author steichen deni placed on providing sound facts
122781 with the release of rawls beckums new casino computer programmer volunteers book were going to see record traffic levels
122782 it will be a top seller im sure and even though it is meant for those familiar with the casino computer programmer volunteers literary world many others may find it of general interest as well
122783 im happy we were able to release my casino computer programmer volunteers book on time
122784 timing is crucial in this market and luckily we chose the right publishers for the job
122785 this book speaks volumes about the impact of casino computer programmer volunteers in society and we knew from a business responsibility stand point that releasing it on time would really make a difference
122786 i fully expect a sequel to be release within six months
122787 typically we see interest wane a year after the initial release so it is important to stay on schedule and release subsequent books at pique points of public interest
122788 i think teaching this story will be highly educational for my casino computer programmer volunteers students irregardless of what critics believe
122789 heck if we always listened to critics nothing would be sold they serve a purpose but i leave the fact checking to qualified historians and researchers
122790 i think shirley lamanas new docu novel leads readers astray there is too much focus on making the fictional characters function whereas more attention should have been paid to the facts
122791 i like the fact that it reaches out to those outside of the literary world this is a wise decision and proves a good way to educate others about new things
122792 we stocked our shelves with double the normal number of first editions for this major casino computer programmer volunteers biographical novel release
122793 and we expect to sell out very fast ashlie sughrues casino computer programmer volunteers book brought hundreds of pre sale orders and numerous bulk order requests so the question of whether or not well sell out is moot
122794 but were doing it to make sure no unauthorized copies get resold we want to avoid plagiarism and pirating as much as possible furthermore this will be our new procedure for future releases by author audrie sheldon who has pledged support for this system
122795 my fans seem to be confused when the outside world appreciates our work so i can only imagine this terrifies them

122798 the second quarter result is primarily influenced by high oil and gas prices our record earnings are also coming as a result of operational focus contributing to high production
122799 our equity production increased 6 from the second quarter of 2007 mainly due to new capacity both on and outside the norwegian continental shelf ncs and higher gas offtake a number of our fields will undergo planned turnarounds in the next quarter in total we are on track to deliver on our 2008 production ambition
122800 we are also satisfied with our exploration results this year in the first half of 2008 we have completed a total of 49 exploration wells out of which 18 have been declared as discoveries for the full year we plan to drill at least 70 wells

122807 i wouldnt say i know all the players in league one or the championship or even the premier league any more but you do your research and your homework and make sure you are up to speed
122808 we have got to be realistic and try to establish ourselves in this division this season
122809 the side had a great season last year but that was in league two and they have to step up a level now there are better opponents now and they have to face that challenge
122810 but its exciting for the players to face teams like leicester and leeds that is what you want as a player to go to the big grounds and face the atmosphere
122811 it was a peculiar situation because i was working in switzerland covering euro 2008 for television when a contact from the pfa got in touch with me and told me about the interest from mk dons
122812 it happened really fast and in just a few days i was here and i am very excited by the challenge
122813 coaching wasnt what i wanted to do straight away when i stopped playing even though i did all my coaching badges when i first retired
122814 i enjoyed having some time away from the game but in the past year or so i was getting hungry again and wanted some success
122815 football always stays in your blood even if you try to block it sooner or later it comes out and grabs your attention and that is what happened here
122816 in my head he is staying except if there is an offer of x million euros
122817 but this offer is not coming for some time i have been left with the idea that he is going to stay at the club
122818 it is no surprise that theyve all gone on to manage at premier league clubs as they are all leaders
122819 the managers philosophy is that you have to be able to run in order to win matches in the premier league
122820 all the skill in the world is no use to you if you cannot match the opposition for pace and movement
122821 we took great pride in the fact that the statistics showed that there was no fitter team in the premier league than blackburn we aim to make sure that is the case with city
122822 the knowledge that they had that edge over the opposition gave our lads great confidence to go on and win tight games
122823 we will be asking for a bit more from all of the squad here
122824 i am young enough to have that energy and drive not just to drive a team but also a club
122825 i want to be able to build from within and utilise every part of what we do here
122826 the academy is part of that and first class the quality of players it has produced suggests there is very little wrong with what the operation is doing
122827 i like to give youth its chance and i know city fans like to see their own coming through
122828 the ambition of the whole club is to challenge at the top table not only in this country but in europe
122829 it is a results driven business and you are judged on results and the decisions you take it does not faze me it it something you have to thrive on
122830 we have built a trophy cabinet and are ready to fill it it is not a case of if but when
122831 there are a lot of people out there who invest a lot of money in the club and we have a responsibility to them
122832 there are few teams to have four strikers of this calibre
122833 so it has never crossed my mind to sell trezeguet or iaquinta
122834 they must remain calm because all of them will remain at the club
122835 hes in love with everything im amazed by all his energy
122836 hes leaving a hole but we congratulate him on moving ahead
122837 it was after a protest at an anti gay church
122838 he was this young man with fabulous ideas about how things should go
122839 he has a huge presence in lansing the issues he comes to lansing to talk about have a huge importance to the people in michigan and to me
122840 we had a friendship that superseded his job and i wish him a lot of luck
122841 i am going to miss his incredible instincts for building human relationships and knowing just how to meet people where they are and then being able to ask what is needed of them
122842 im also going to miss having a professional coworker that knows how to work hard and play hard
122843 its never dry with sean its always wet and wild
122844 sean theres a rumor going around that i called you a butt head
122845 but really what i said was that we some times butt heads
122846 sean has also been called a media whore and i just want to say that thats offensive
122847 did you know that sean suffers from a speech impediment
122848 the very first speech i ever gave i had to follow jesse jackson
122849 in order to really prepare for your roast i wanted to interview all of your ex lovers
122850 that job was a little bigger than i anticipated so were they
122851 i am a better person for having known you and our community is stronger because of you
122852 its incredibly sad to leave michigan and triangle but im very excited for triangles future and for mine and my partners michigan has nothing but exciting things ahead both on the civil rights front and the economic front
122853 theyre not choosing to push gay marriage through legislation in alabama
122854 its become clear to most americans that there is no real good argument against allowing gays to marry
122855 they can see with their own eyes that the gays didnt use up all the marriage licenses
122856 its a strategic and tactical mismatch to have their best national people going up against our best state people
122857 it resonates with people that i understand what the issues are and that ive got enough of a background to start thinking about ways to address the issues
122858 its important to allow the development to continue but to make sure that it happens in a way that reflects what we as annarborites see as our character that its funky and that it keeps us in mind too
122859 its important to have the historic as well as the new
122860 southeast michigan is so different than most other metropolitan areas people go to where they can go from downtown get on a train go to the airport and in two hours theyre in the terminal
122861 we are just lacking that in this region im interested in working collaboratively with other local governments to reach some sort of solution for transportation
122862 i think that most decisions come from building consensus by talking with colleagues working with ideas getting the background information and sharing that so that when it comes time to actually vote people feel comfortable enough that they have the information and that the ideas a pretty good one and theres funding for it and good reasons to go forward
122863 it was fun to take something that was just this spark and really make it into a functioning organization
122864 i think i have very strong connections to the community
122865 but the coolest thing is that my orientation is not an issue its not like im a gay candidate a lesbian candidate running im a candidate first and i happen to be a lesbian nobody mentions it which is i think the coolest part because it doesnt matter to anybody here
122866 what i will do is talk to members of the human rights commission to make sure that we are covered and that we have as many ordinances in the city as possibly that give us equality
122867 im looking forward to continuing ann arbors very progressive political nature
122868 if a brand wants to embed itself into youth culture it not only needs to use the mediums that are shaping the youth culture but must also embed itself inside the message art fashion music and digital media heavily influence youth culture we needed to integrate these into the brand and vice versa rather than simply try to advertise our way into the market
122869 this was a six month creative programme centred on a retail space in melville johannesburg the space is designed to not only perform as a retail store but also a platform for physical consumer engagements that feature a mix of contemporary art fashion and music events
122870 the digital platforms we build are critical to the success of the campaign they support and promote ongoing connection and collaboration between djs artists and designers
122871 we then maximise our reach into social networks by these individuals who broadcast their interpretation of the nike brand in a relevant and authentic way to our target market via platforms like flickr youtube myspace google and facebook whats more we also build a captive audience that allows us to continue communication at a 1 to 1 level
122872 the youngblood5 site contained hard hitting copy and visual attitude aimed at connecting with the youth
122873 awareness posters designed by well known artists were placed in schools to drive audience to the site the posters were then adapted and offered as downloadable screensavers stickers could also be created on the site and a selection of these was turned into real stickers published in youth based printed magazines nationwide helping drive traffic back to the site
122874 over 1000 causes and 5000 comments were created within the first three months of the campaign 80 of the site content being generated by the audience due to the campaigns success 5fm is currently launching the project into its second phase
122875 brings the total number to an impressive and unprecedented 15 this means it has notched up one for each year of its existence i guess thats one way of reminding us to act our age or helps us work out how young we still are
122876 ive learned a lot about this community between 2001 and now and some of the greatest detroiters doing some of the greatest things in our community are here
122877 i think their mayor should show up and say thank you
122878 i learned about the ruth ellis center about a year and a half ago
122879 i had a meeting in my office two years ago with a lot of the young people from detroit public schools who are gay lesbian trans i found out a lot about our young people
122880 there needs to be a place for them to go a place where parents can learn more about it where the community can learn more about our young people we shouldnt cast people aside weve got to love each other
122881 i thought it was a good thing for him to come out and acknowledge our community to walk around and meet people
122882 the lgbt community is very much a part of this city and metropolitan area to have the number one city official come out and recognize our event is phenomenal
122883 i always say that its around 10 000 people but our sound people said that i need to stop telling that lie
122884 in saginaw they dont have things like this for us for couples of the same sex
122885 we like it here because we feel that we fit in
122886 the parade went really well and i think we had a nice turnout for our vip reception
122887 our palmer park picnic which is always our biggest group was great
122888 reaching out to people listening being accessible and acting as the person who helps put the pieces together
122889 what ive done in this campaign is ive been very adamant about meeting as many people as possible
122890 so i decided i wanted to knock on voters doors not once but twice
122891 i wanted to hear from people at their doors what their concerns were i had an inkling that the economy and jobs were going to be important but i felt that it wasnt up to me to decide what the issues where
122892 to me you cant really know or understand a community until you actually walk in their shoes at their doors seeing their street
122893 you really get a sense of the community and how people live
122894 ellen cogen lipton is one of several great candidates in the democratic primary in hd 27 ellen has proven to be the most viable and we are certain she will be a champion for our issues
122895 she is a committed progressive and a fundraising powerhouse being able to raise lots of money could end her up in leadership and possibly speaker that is really important for lgbt people since her district has one of the strongest concentrations of people from our community ellen is bright personable and amazing
122896 ellen is making grass roots connections with members of the glbt constituency that live in my district and will continue to be a voice for fairness and civil rights in the treatment of all those that live in the 27th said zerafa
122897 ellen will work with members of both parties to strengthen and promote legal protections for glbt youth couples and all who identify as such
122898 ellen cogen lipton is a phenomenal candidate with the talent intelligence and vision this district needs in lansing
122899 the biggest issue that came up and its been brought up in other town hall meetings that ive had was the issue of discrimination in this state that were one of the few states that does not protect people based on sexual identity
122900 i feel very strongly that thats something that we need to address in this state
122901 that piece of paper an adoption certificate is the one thing that would stand between him and complete emotion tragedy if god forbid something did happen to his birth mother
122902 the state might regard him as an orphan or send him to a relative he is not emotionally connected to
122903 the vaccine regimen did not warrant a trial of this size and scope pave 100 will not proceed
122904 scientifically intriguing and sufficiently different from previously tested hiv vaccines to consider testing it in smaller more focused clinical studies
122905 will entertain a proposal for an alternative study with one specific goal to determine if the vaccine regimen significantly lowers viral load the amount of hiv in the blood of vaccinated individuals who may later become infected with hiv
122906 the fundamental question is whether an effective vaccine against hiv 1 is feasible at the current time
122907 we dont know how to elicit antibodies with broadly neutralizing activity we dont know how to deal with the enormous sequence diversity presents in the virus and we dont know what constitutes immune protection
122908 after nearly a year of public hand wringing and unproductive public attacks on the entire search for an aids vaccine it is essential that this decision not be viewed as a vote of no confidence for the overall endeavor
122909 the city of lansing and the lansing police department believe that our state laws must recognize the seriousness of crimes that are motivated by bias and hate
122910 we need to send a strong message that violence against another person because of the color of their skin their gender or their sexual orientation is unacceptable and will be met with severe consequences through our judicial system
122911 we stand with the premise that a hate crime against an individual is a crime against all of us
122912 i promise we will move this through the judiciary committee and the house of representatives
122913 victims of bias violence suffer the trauma of the crime itself as well as feelings of humiliation for being targeted for who they are or appear to be
122914 this often causes these vulnerable victims to retreat into an isolated silence the bias motivated crime bill empowers victims to speak out against prejudice and provides avenues to seek true justice
122915 while civil rights organizations like michigan equality and triangle have worked hard to provide assistance to victims of bias violence the reality is the system is fundamentally outdated
122916 this legislation simply expands existing laws and provides additional punishments for crimes to address the trauma of victims targeted by bias violence
122917 michigan is the most segregated state in the country according to information from the u s census bureau the fbi reports michigan ranks as the third highest number of bias incidents difference are not accepted in michigan one would assume from that information but that is not true
122918 this will send a message to all citizens that yes we do tolerate everyone
122919 we will be joining 31 other states when we pass this
122920 the loss of service members with critical skills needed in the field right now
122921 after talking with many servicemembers active duty reserve and retired and concluded that the open service of gay men and women need not present an operational problem
122922 morale good order and discipline and unit cohesion that are the essence of military capability our challenge is to examine and determine whether that conclusion of 1993 remains valid here in 2008
122923 military leadership is about being able to constantly adapt to change that is why we are the best military in the world and that is why we are better than the outdated arguments that some still use to prop up dont ask dont tell
122924 the space that i had been in minutes earlier was completely destroyed seven of my coworkers were killed the reality is that if i had been killed my partner of then 11 years would have been the last to know as i had not dared to list her in my emergency contact information
122925 that i had fought and nearly died to secure rights for others that i myself was not free to enjoy i had proudly served a country that was not proud of me
122926 forces trained and ready troops to choose between serving their country and living openly it undercuts unit cohesion by forcing people to lie about themselves while kicking them out reduces military readiness
122927 forced cohabitation of men and women with homosexuals in the military
122928 you are basically asserting that straight men and women in our military arent professional enough to serve with openly gay troops while successfully completing their military mission i think that is an insult to me and to many soldiers
122929 ms donnelly can you please justify your position that american servicemen and women are less professional and less mission capable
122930 heterosexual misconduct homosexual misconduct is wrong i think it is scurrilous to bring it up because it really distorts the issue
122931 by the lowest common denominator there are people in the military who believe that unit cohesion can be enhanced if our military reflected the opportunity and freedom that we believe is america
122932 a great beginning on the journey to repeal i look forward to the hearings in the next congress in the house and the senate
122933 given the mood of the committee i think that it is very clear that the days of dont ask dont tell are numbered
122934 if you look at the tenor of the conversation today versus 1993 it was night and day they werent willing to buy into the stereotypes and throw away comments from the opposition they really pressed hard on it that was good it showed that education over 15 years has been working
122935 were not cowed by those who assert that repeal is bad for the military
122936 congress is likely to face a huge sea change in november with a lot of new people coming in who i think will be very supportive of repeal
122937 sudden acts of violence often remind us of other violence we have witnessed and experienced and it can be useful to be with others who are shocked and saddened for a time of togetherness
122938 our institution has always attempted to be a force for peace and justice when we suffer setbacks we also strive to be a source of comfort
122939 it appears that what brought him to this horrible event was his lack of being able to obtain a job his frustration over that and his stated hatred of the liberal movement
122940 some publicity in the recent past regarding its liberal stance on things
122941 stood in the front of the gunman and took the blast to protect the rest of us
122942 greg mckendry was a very large gentleman one of those people you might describe as a refrigerator with a head
122943 he looked like a football player he did obviously stand up and put himself in between the shooter and the congregation
122944 he spent his life teaching and enjoyed it very much when his daughter came out to him he was determined to teach as much of the world as he could reach that being gay or lesbian was a natural thing and so he did to the end of his life he co founded the local chapter of parents families and friends of lesbians and gays tri cities in 1985 and often shared his experiences as a parent with other parents who were seeking knowledge rich helped hundreds of families accept their own sexuality and that of their children and others
122945 its about an african american gay woman who wants to reconcile her relationship with her family without sacrificing her sexual identity
122946 for me i like things that youve never seen before
122947 originally i was just going to make the character transgender but then i thought nah thats not enough so i thought it would be great to give a voice to this community
122948 dont go is just so different and so diverse from whats out there that i think people are afraid to take the risk
122949 right now what youre seeing is just my heart and soul
122950 when you see these stories you see some of things that we live every day
122951 were just like everybody else and soon through the movement people are going to know that
122952 only be careful and watch yourselves closely so that you do not forget the things your eyes have seen or let them slip from your heart as long as you live teach them to your children and to their children after them
122953 am i leaving a spiritual role model to my grandchildren and loved ones
122954 lo i am with you always even to the end of the world
122955 it may be wonderful to leave behind wealth for the generations to follow however at best money and possessions are fragile and unstable however we can leave behind for our descendants a spiritual trust that can never be stolen squandered or lost we can leave riches that will only increase in value we can lay up a storehouse of imperishable wealth
122956 individuals making sure that they can make their tackles thats what probably let us down a little bit just individuals missing tackles
122957 so we made sure the guys are aware of that and theyll rectify it and make sure they know what to do next time they come up against him
122958 the work at the breakdowns been good and their scrambling
122959 ever since the first test against ireland weve had to do a fair bit of scrambling so theyve become adept at defending well covering each other
122960 their attitude and their talks been excellent and its just improved and obviously the physicality with each game has come up as well

122966 i want to go out on a limb and say that my dark horse for fourth spot is great britain
122967 their goal for 2012 is top four theyre going to achieve that here
122968 they are the ones truly on the rise similar to china
122969 for the same reasons that china is coming and emerging after getting the 2008 games great britain are creating a great programme and putting enormous resources from the sport lottery into their programme

122985 we had a meeting with ochoa to tell him we refused the offer from everton and galatasarays proposal was just unsatisfactory
122986 neither us or the player think that a loan for a player of the quality of ochoa is something serious
122987 we have arranged with ochoa that beside the fact he has a contract with america until 2010 if an important offer appears next year we will do all we can do to transfer him because good players like him deserve to be transferred to a european team and improve their career

123000 eine politisierung der spiele w rde meines erachtens nichts gutes bringen mehr noch dadurch werden der olympische geist und die grundlagen der olympia bewegung untergraben

123004 he was a wonderful middle order batsman who was not allowed to fulfil his potential in his test career because he was converted into an opening batsman for which he was not well equipped
123005 as a middle order batsman he was solid on the lines of polly umrigar and chandu borde but he got converted into an opener and succeeded too initially but i always thought he did not have it in him to be an opener
123006 he was also a fine captain a good tactician and a very knowledgeable cricketer fate has been so cruel to him
123007 its too early for him to depart from us perhaps he could have done better had he continued to play in the middle order
123008 he was a perfect team man who kept the team members in good humour in the dressing room
123009 i was shocked to hear the sad news of the demise of ashok mankad a former test cricketer
123010 mankad had a great cricketing brain and was regarded by one and all as a great tactician in the passing away of mankad the cricketing fraternity has lost a great friend philosopher and guide
123011 indian cricket lost one of its stalwarts when ashok mankad passed away earlier today on behalf of the board and cricket fans across the land i would like to express heartfelt condolences to the mankad family

123014 this graph shows the general trend of changing ice volume on the earth over the past 750 000 years
123015 some experts stressed that the event should not be totally attributed to climate change
123016 the break off is consistent with other changes weve seen in the area such as the reduction in the amount of sea ice the retreat of the glaciers and the break up of other ice shelves
123017 its not conducive to regrowing them its a one way process
123018 climate change was the huge load on the camels back wind was the last straw

123021 epa is bending to the will of corporate financial and misguided political interests that will pollute new mexicos skies
123022 epas decision ignores its obligations to protect the health of residents and the environment in new mexico and the region we will not allow this ill advised decision to stand
123023 it is a devastating blow to tribal members who continually suffer from the large coal complex encroaching upon our land
123024 this one massive plant will negate the emissions reductions being implemented by the northeastern states in the first mandatory regional program to cut global warming pollution
123025 the administrations shameful decision rewards polluters flouts the clean air act and fails the american people

123027 the olympiad cycle was a very simple four year cycle and you do not need a sophisticated instrument like this to calculate it it took us by huge surprise when we saw this
123028 but the games were of such cultural and social importance that it is not unnatural to have it in the mechanism

123032 he is a very good player he would be a great acquisition for madrid but i remember when i was at chelsea and madrid became interested it was always tomorrow tomorrow
123033 it took six weeks for things to happen and that was a very difficult situation that affected me badly i trained with chelsea every day but my head was with madrid
123034 i can only advise van der vaart to remain calm he has to keep training with hamburg and keep physically fit
123035 everyone knows that cristiano is one of the best in the world that is obvious but we are working and playing and nothing more i think that is more important than thinking about who the club will sign
123036 it is difficult for me to talk about this because people have been on about it already for two months i prefer to talk about players when they are with madrid
123037 it does hurt a bit but not because they call me that but because i know people read it and believe and i do not think it is true i am not made of glass it is all related to my back
123038 i have now worked this summer because in wanted to just relax i like to work though because i know that i need to and think that i have to do more than other players
123039 this year is very important i want to play better than i have in the past two seasons i have had many injuries and when you suffer so many it is difficult to play at a high level

123077 who is ever going to forget him putting together the russian five or scotty really willing steve yzerman to become in my opinion the best two way player in the game and obviously the championships

123105 we both were ready to drop and i didnt want to or couldnt race mike for another 23 miles so we decided to help each other to the finish
123106 i dont think either one of us would have made it otherwise we went out way too fast in the first 50 miles and it beat us up the heat and altitude really took a toll
123107 bev and i are good friends before and after the race but during the race we are great rivals
123108 i knew we were going out way too fast but i also know that i can recover from that so my plan was to push the pace until someone cracked
123109 i ran into a stomach issue around mile 20 and that gave me a rollercoaster ride all day
123110 being a loop course it was tough to find the motivation to go out on the second 50 mile loop because of the altitude and the two loops i consider this course to be harder than western states and i heard others say the same

123128 i like him a lot hes done various things in his life he hasnt just stayed to one thing
123129 hes played all different cards and he went from singing and rapping to comedy to going to action movies to going up to nominations and sad roles with his kids and i just think that hes a very good role model and i hear hes so nice and he makes the set so energetic i really admire him for that

123140 i did not expect the acceleration that were seeing in the out years
123141 whether were talking about logs generated by network or application firewalls intrusion detection systems file integrity monitor tools or the operating systems themselves ive come to the conclusion that the only people who dont hate them are the vendors who sell them
123142 due to overwhelming interest in card rewards we are currently experiencing difficulty accessing starbucks card accounts we are working to fix the problem and ask that you please try again later
123143 but say it doesnt were still under a lot of pressure to get a park that is our own that isnt going to go away so my hope is that well find a way to make it happen it has not been as easy as i thought it would be
123144 to lew i think it seems like theyre delaying things
123145 in lews mind i think he thinks theyre not being entirely reasonable im not super worried but im concerned i think its important that we get the issues resolved so that we can move forward
123146 but the problem is we cant give them exactly what they want
123147 i am one of the few fans who aside from season ticket holders have attended at least eight games this year
123148 i can no longer do that the rest of this year not when i am watching a minor league team or a group of players who are boring and simply unwatchable i want to attend games but i need more than root beer to do so
123149 but we decided to spend more than we normally would to add or keep our best players
123150 were trying to win every game but there comes a time when youve got to decide where your team is going to be in a few years and general manager billy beane has done his job in identifying where we are now and where we want to be
123151 i dont think its fan apathy as much as the market has been established
123152 we made a real fight for the playoffs in 2006 and in 2007 the fan interest was no greater it says to me that our fan market isnt elastic
123153 we cant have aging players and keep them just because the fans would like to see them here
123154 its not like our players are not going to get through waivers
123155 well decide on friday beginning with fridays series who we want to play and when
123156 our veterans have been great about what our needs have been i dont expect that to change theyre not going to be an impediment they all have a good relationship with the ballclub and the manager and myself and the front office they understand the program theres not any problem with the path were following
123157 obviously ill have to to take pressure off bruce bochy and make sure everybody is on the same page
123158 it was a nice thought yeah we were hoping but early on i knew that wasnt going to happen it didnt take the last couple days to figure it out players like that havent been moved so that will tell you what the climate was like
123159 we did all the work and there was no interest
123160 were confident this is an ongoing process now well see who gets through waivers and hope people come to their senses
123161 the day has come and gone but its not an impediment in my mind to what we need to do

123167 was man nicht darf ist kurz vor wahlen aufzurufen die politische konkurrenz zu w hlen
123168 so wichtig ist wolfgang clement nicht mehr dass wir nun wochenlang dar ber streiten sollten wie das mit ihm weitergeht
123169 es hat doch ohnehin seit monaten niemand mehr geglaubt dass wolfgang clement spd mitglied ist da w rde es auch keinen berraschen wenn er es nicht mehr ist

123174 die landesschiedskommission hat mit dem parteiausschluss von wolfgang clement eine entscheidung getroffen die geeignet ist der sozialdemokratie schweren und nachhaltigen schaden zuzuf gen
123175 falls die entscheidung der landesschiedskommission bestand haben sollte wird sie eine weitreichende politische signalwirkung ber den k nftigen kurs der spd mit u erst fatalen folgen f r die sozialdemokratie haben

123192 historically we have provided those staff who need to access the network remotely with rsa tokens
123193 however the solution was very costly especially as the tokens were being frequently lost and it was taking up a lot of management time both in terms of dealing with lost tokens and setting up new users on the system
123194 since rolling out securenvoy to 300 staff across the hospital we have been able to significantly reduce our administrative overhead and the overall cost of the solution as well as improving the security of our network
123195 we have also had really positive feedback from users who like the simplicity of being able to use their mobile phone as it means they do not have to have the responsibility of carrying additional tokens

123198 this new cloud based service provides timely alerts that allow financial institutions and other online businesses to protect customer accounts against attacks that bypass anti phishing filters as well as operator error by the end user

123297 esperamos que los canadienses reconozcan que cualquier duda sobre su culpabilidad o inocencia debe ser resuelta en un tribunal constitucional que por supuesto no es la bah a de guant namo y que sean compasivos ya que sentimos que los ni os tienen una importancia especial en la sociedad este ni o ya ha sufrido suficiente este ni o debe regresar a casa este ni o no es un terrorista

123366 he was a gifted batsman an outstanding captain and a respected cricket guru an individual who dedicated his life to the sport kaka will be missed by every single follower of cricket in this country
123367 he was a shrewd captain and a very good judge of players he was a good reader of the wicket opposition and his own team mates after all he was the son of vinoobhai
123368 i suppose the mca mumbai cricket association and the cricket board could have utilised his experience and knowledge somewhat better
123369 they were the darlings of the passengers in the ship i remember when i travelled with vinoobhai and his family to london to play in the english cricket league i know ashok from those days its really shocking that hes no more

123380 the new d c gun bill establishes regulations for residents to keep handguns in their homes legally to comply with last months historic supreme court decision that found the citys 32 year prohibition of handguns unconstitutional
123381 city leaders say the legislation goes as afar as it can on gun regulations while respecting the high courts ruling
123382 the legislation also requires that guns remain inside homes it requires eye and written exams for gun owners and ballistics tests conducted by police
123383 opponents of the gun ban say the new legislation and the citys continued prohibition of semiautomatic weapons are not in accordance with the high courts decision
123384 i want to commend my partners on the council for their swift sensible action on our gun laws today d
123385 the senate is near to passing a massive 50 billion emergency plan for hiv aids relief a bill whose priorities are based on myth just like virtually all anti aids efforts worldwide
123386 the worlds top aids bureaucrat recently admitted the truth it is very unlikely that there will be a heterosexual epidemic outside africa kevin de cock director of the world health organization told londons
123387 the effort to democratize aids dates back to the mid 1980s when the media and health officials began a desperate and concerted effort to divert attention and make it seem everyone was at risk the 1985
123388 even today the centers for disease controls hiv aids web site refuses to acknowledge any difference in the risks of aids between anal vaginal or oral sex
123389 dr james chin a former top aids epidemiologist at the world health organization has long declared the un figures to be too high and insists they still are in fact
123390 i merely analyzed public data and studies showing how terribly difficult the disease is to transmit vaginally or orally but the myths are still the basis for aids policy
123391 the group fair allocations in research compiles statistics on federal spending to fight various diseases compared to how many americans each disease kills measured that way we spend 21 times as much on aids as cancer and 78 times what we spend on coronary artery disease 97 times anti stroke spending
123392 plus the ryan white act mandates taxpayer handouts to hiv aids victims of about 1 2 billion a year we have no remotely similar program for victims of any other disease
123393 the same official grotesque distortion holds internationally chin charges that the united nations puts hiv aids victims on a pedestal while other disease victims stay submerged in deadly muck
123394 robert england who heads the charity health systems workshop recently made the same point in the
123395 in the fight against aids profiteering has trumped prevention declared sam l ruteikara co chair of ugandas national aids prevention committee in a
123396 consider a 2008 who unaids unicef report demands aids drugs for every victim worldwide requiring spending hikes from 8 1 billion now to 35 billion by 2010 yet aids remains incurable conversely an african with non resistant tuberculosis is curable with merely 25 of drugs
123397 easily preventable diseases are still killing millions of children each year while
123398 the proportion of ugandans infected with hiv plunged from 21 percent in 1991 to 6 percent in 2002
123399 there is no precedent in history for such myth driven democratization of a disease nor for the abominable unfairness in allocating funds away from so many curable illnesses
123400 the senate agreed wednesday to spend 48 billion to fight aids globally during the next five years a measure that included a provision to lift a 21 year old ban on foreigners with hiv aids entering the united states
123401 the overall aids package passed by a vote of 80 16 and now goes to the house which easily passed a similar version of the bill in april
123402 sens john kerry massachusetts democrat and gordon h smith oregon republican drafted the proposal to kill the travel restriction calling it an antiquated and punitively unfair reaction to people with hiv
123403 the pentagon is finishing work on its annual report to congress on chinas military power but with an unusual difference in the process this year chinas military has sent two delegations to the u s to help draft it
123404 china has announced double digit percentage increases in arms spending every year for nearly two decades
123405 u s government and private estimates of chinese defense spending are much higher but because of chinas secrecy they vary widely from about 130 billion a year to as much as 200 billion annually
123406 pentagon officials say chinese complaints about the report are only one problem slowing the process the other involves frequent objections from dovish state department and pro china u s intelligence officials intent on playing down the growing threat from china so far non pentagon officials requested about 50 report changes in seeking to water it down the report was expected march 1 but will not be finished for several weeks
123407 one example a pro china defense intelligence agency analyst succeeded three years ago in deleting from the report new intelligence on a secret range extension program from chinas long range nuclear missiles the analysts saw to it that the report left out details including a map showing that the threat posed by the missiles had increased dramatically by boosting the range of chinas 20 to 30 df 5a missiles so that their 3 megaton warheads now target 200 million americans over most of the united states before the 2002 2004 upgrade chinese nuclear missiles could target only about 50 million americans in alaska hawaii and the west coast
123408 only in america could critics of a group called the race be labeled racists such is the triumph of left wing identity chauvinists whose aggressive activists and supine abettors have succeeded in redefining all opposition as hate
123409 both barack obama and john mccain will speak this week in san diego at the annual conference of the national council of la raza the latino organization whose name is spanish for yes the race can you imagine obama and mccain paying homage to a group of white people who called themselves that no matter the presidential candidates and the media have legitimized the race as a mainstream ethnic lobbying group and marginalized its critics as intolerant bigots the unvarnished truth is the group is a radical ethnic nationalist outfit that abuses your tax dollars and milks pc politics to undermine our sovereignty
123410 here re 15 things you should know about the race
123411 13 the race opposes cooperative immigration enforcement by local state and federal authorities
123412 12 the race opposes a secure fence on the southern border
123413 11 the race joined the american arab anti discrimination committee in a failed lawsuit attempt to prevent the feds from entering immigration information into a key national crime database
123414 10 the race opposed the state of oklahomas tough immigration enforcement first laws which cut off welfare to illegal aliens put teeth in employer sanctions and strengthened local federal cooperation
123415 7 the race has opposed post 9 11 national security measures at every turn
123416 6 former race president raul yzaguirre hillary clintons hispanic outreach adviser said this
123417 4 the race is leading a smear campaign against immigration enforcement leaders and has called for tv and cable news networks to keep immigration enforcement proponents off the airwaves in addition to

123419 republican presidential candidate john mccain in one of his strongest endorsements of free trade called himself an unapologetic supporter of nafta an agreement that many americans feel has cost them jobs
123420 the arizona senator has often defended free trade but mondays speech was among his most detailed and full throated commentaries
123421 citing his recent visit to colombia and mexico mccain said he understands how vitally important it is to the prosperity and security of our country to strengthen our trade investment and diplomatic ties to other countries in our hemisphere
123422 mccains democratic opponent barack obama has been much cooler to free trade agreements and wants to revisit some aspects of nafta
123423 mccain said he has earned the trust of hispanic voters by championing an immigration reform bill that nearly killed his presidential bid obama he said failed to take a similar stand on the politically explosive issue of illegal immigration
123424 mccain said the two failed bills which he supported would have dealt practically and humanely with illegal immigrants without excusing the fact they came here illegally or granting them privileges before those who have been waiting their turn outside the country
123425 critics of the 2006 bill he backed however said it would have granted just such privileges to some illegal immigrants it would have allowed those who have been in the country five years or more to remain continue working and eventually become legal permanent residents and citizens after paying at least 3 250 in fines and fees and back taxes and learning english

123427 although the constitution of 1787 mentioned citizens it did not define citizenship it was in 1868 that a definition of citizenship entered the constitution with the ratification of the fourteenth amendment here is the familiar language all persons born or naturalized in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the united states and of the state wherein they reside thus there are two components to american citizenship birth or naturalization in the u s and being subject to the jurisdiction of the u s we have somehow come today to believe that anyone born within the geographical limits of the u s is automatically subject to its jurisdiction but this renders the jurisdiction clause utterly superfluous and without force if this had been the intention of the framers of the fourteenth amendment presumably they would simply have said that all persons born or naturalized in the united states are thereby citizens
123428 indeed during debate over the amendment senator jacob howard of ohio the author of the citizenship clause attempted to assure skeptical colleagues that
123429 senator lyman trumbull chairman of the senate judiciary committee rose to support his colleague arguing that
123430 consider as well that in 1868 the year the fourteenth amendment was ratified congress passed the expatriation act
123431 in sum this legacy of feudalism which we today call birthright citizenship was decisively rejected as the ground of american citizenship by the fourteenth amendment and the expatriation act of 1868
123432 t o say that children of legal aliens are entitled to citizenship is one thing after all their parents are in the country with the permission of the u s it is entirely different with illegal aliens who are here without permission thus repeal of the current policy of birthright citizenship for the children of illegal aliens would not require a constitutional amendment
123433 we have seen that the framers of the fourteenth amendment unanimously agreed that indians were not subject to the jurisdiction of the u s
123434 this citizenship was based on reciprocal consent an offer on the part of the u s and acceptance on the part of an individual thus congress used its legislative powers under the fourteenth amendment to determine who was within the jurisdiction of the u s it could make a similar determination today based on this legislative precedent that children born in the u s to illegal aliens are not subject to american jurisdiction
123435 a constitutional amendment is no more required now than it was in 1923

123437 the american college of obstetrics and gynecologists acog had recently issued policy 385 which said that all doctors even those opposed to abortion must either do the procedure themselves or have a referral arrangement to someone who would the implication was that any physician who doesnt do this may be guilty of malpractice the policy could also be interpreted to suggest that even if a patient wanted to be pregnant had been trying to get pregnant and was happy about being pregnant her doctor must discuss abortion with her as one of her options
123438 this is an outrageous attempt by one of the most radically pro abortion entities in the country to extort legitimate physicians into becoming baby killers it is remarkably similar to an effort a few years back by the accreditation council for graduate medical education the entity that accredits all medical schools in the u s like acog the acgme is a radically pro abortion organization it had issued a directive that all medical students would be required to do abortions in order to graduate at that time life dynamics responded with a direct mail campaign advising students about their legal rights and offering legal help if necessary in short we called the acgmes bluff it worked and the issue more or less went away
123439 thanks to your financial support life dynamics has been able to launch a parallel campaign against this acog initiative a couple of weeks ago we began with a very aggressive mailing to the offices of every ob gyn in the country it was centered around the theme that
123440 this was a great one two punch and the response to both of these efforts was all we could have hoped for
123441 by the way the abortionist shortage is becoming so pronounced that the abortion industry is now beginning a major push to get states to allow non physicians to do them in fact they already have a scalp nailed to the barn door a couple of weeks ago arizona medical authorities ruled that nurses now have the legal right to kill the unborn fortunately one arizona state representative has introduced legislation to reverse this obscene pronouncement whether that will succeed or not is still unclear in any case as i have often stated the death lobby is always willing to do whatever it takes to win and we must always be prepared to do whatever it takes to stop them
123442 the united nations is calling for more investment in family planning
123443 in a report marking world population day the un estimates that the number of people on the planet will grow from 6 7bn to 9 2bn by the year 2050 that means greater demand for food water and fuel
123444 such growth is unsustainable the un says as climate change degrades arable land and reduces water supplies the hard truth is the un adds the world does not even want so many new people more than 200 million women many in the developing world do not have access to contraceptives
123445 hundreds of thousands of women die in childbirth each year or from botched illegal abortions and women are crucial to the worlds food production in africa and asia they grow over 80 of crops access to contraceptives would give women the chance to plan their families and the resulting slower population growth would the un says ease pressure on food supplies and reduce damage to the environment providing family planning to all those who want it will cost 1 2bn a year but the un says at the moment less than half that is being spent
123446 knee pain is one of the most common musculoskeletal complaints that bring people to their doctor
123447 human cartilage injuries heal poorly and can lead to cartilage degeneration and osteoarthritis this is an enormous clinical problem it is estimated that one quarter of the adult population will have some kind of arthritis by 2020
123448 the research we have published is an early but important step in unraveling the important pathways that will facilitate development of new treatments
123449 if we can identify what genes or proteins are necessary for cartilage to heal we can work toward finding similar genes and proteins in humans

123526 it is only if you bring numbers down that we will be able to find a way for resource utilisation per capita to increase it is the only way you are going to deal with poverty and unless you deal with poverty the situation can only spiral downwards this is a massive problem and the solutions are not simply condoms versus draconian measures such as one child per family it has to be looked at in different countries in different ways i think there has to be a commitment everywhere to slow and stop population growth i do believe that we have been set back a long way by the opposition to family planning that is being shown by some of the religious groups and by some of the more conservative governments such as the current us administration
123527 world statistics posted on the internet about nuclear substances are shocking an example is that less than 8 kilograms of of a substance called plutonium is enough for one nagasaki type bomb the technology applied in producing nuclear energy particularly the process that turns raw uranium into lowly enriched uranium can also be used to produce highly enriched weapons grade uranium the international atomic energy agency iaea is responsible for monitoring the worlds nuclear facilities and for preventing weapons proliferation but their safeguards are said to have serious shortcomings on april 26 1986 the number 4 reactor at the chernobyl power plant in the former u s s r and present day ukraine exploded causing the worst nuclear accident ever

123534 africa is endowed with abundant water resources with over 60 transboundary river basins 17 major rivers and 16 large lakes but these resources are highly underutilized as only 3 8 is developed for water supply irrigation and hydropower generation 6 of the cultivated land is irrigated and only about 3 of our hydro potential is developed
123535 spread such diseases as diarrhea cholera dysentery typhoid hepatitis polio trachoma malaria and filariasis
123536 underlying all of the ambitious sectoral commitments made in 2005 was the commitment to mobilise an additional 25 billion in development assistance for africa by 2010 and to spend this money effectively due to some clarifications the total committed is now an increase in official development assistance oda from 15 8 billion in 2004 to 37 6 billion in 2010 an increase of an additional 21 8 billion three years since the commitments were made only 3 billion of the increase has been delivered leaving 18 8 billion still to be delivered 2
123537 in order to be on a straight line trajectory to delivering the full commitment by 2010 the g7 would have needed to increase assistance by 5 88 billion between 2006 and 2007 but with only 837 million in additional assistance in 2007 they have fallen 5 04 billion short of that target 3

123541 the three trillion dollar war the true cost of the iraq conflict
123542 the united states is a rich and strong country but even rich and strong countries squander trillions of dollars at their peril think what a difference 3 trillion could make for so many of the united states or the worlds problems we could have had a marshall plan to help desperately poor countries winning the hearts and maybe the minds of muslim nations now gripped by anti americanism in a world with millions of illiterate children we could have achieved literacy for all for less than the price of a months combat in iraq we worry about chinas growing influence in africa but the upfront cost of a month of fighting in iraq would pay for more than doubling our annual current aid spending on africa
123543 the hdi human development index is a summary composite index that measures a countrys average achievements in three basic aspects of human development health knowledge and a decent standard of living health is measured by life expectancy at birth knowledge is measured by a combination of the adult literacy rate and the combined primary secondary and tertiary gross enrolment ratio and standard of living by gdp per capita ppp us

123564 i was only two years old on that famous night but i know the players are legends everyone loves them and we all hope that we can do the same with this team it is always a great feeling when you score or win a match so imagine what it feels like if you win the league in those circumstances every player would like to live a moment like michael did
123565 i get asked about the goal once or twice a day if im lucky the feeling among the squad heading up there was fantastic a month before george graham had changed the back four to a back five so it was great for us attacking midfield players we just had to attack and have no fear bringing the trophy back south was an honour in itself for me it was just fantastic
123566 its wonderful that this match is not just arsenal folklore but football folklore in general
123567 george graham told us just before we went out for the match to have no regrets go out there and enjoy it and thats what we did it was just amazing to be involved that night it was a great night for arsenal football club but i also remember the great acts of sportsmanship by liverpool many stewards and police at anfield congratulated us on the pitch it was a very emotional time and the kop gave us a standing ovation which just shows the class of liverpool when we eventually got into the dressing room the champagne was flowing and the journey back down the m6 and m1 just went like a flash
123568 remember when we camped out in the back yard remember when you had a crush on tommy
123569 ooohh no i dont see how that would be possible no way

123571 i could see him in a viking uniform though i guess theyre going after him pretty hard ok well if they got him theyd be uh theyd be tough the way they run the ball and with him theyd be real real tough
123572 yes i would definitely think so i mean their defense is good they have a great running game i mean nothing against but they really havent thrown the ball that great you know the last couple of years so if you put him in there it automatically upgrades their passing game right there
123573 its hard to escape because you hear brett favre this favre that
123574 i try not to pay attention because i dont really care ever since i got pulled last year ive tried to worry about everything i can control and nothing else

123582 he did have other options but as soon as i had a chat with him i realised he was the one i wanted in my dressing room and on our pitch
123583 if somebody finds space in the penalty area and can finish he will do that as its something thats natural to him
123584 hes a great athlete but he has got that ability to find space in the penalty area and thats what we want

123654 she seemed to hiss the word silently on thought waves scalding steam from inaudible words pouring from her tongue
123655 screaming passengers fled in terror from a greyhound bus as an unidentified fellow passenger suddenly stabbed a man sleeping next to him decapitated him and waved the severed head at horrified witnesses standing outside the apparently unprovoked assault left 36 men women and children stranded wednesday night on the shoulder of the darkening trans canada highway near portage la prairie man about 85 kilometres west of winnipeg watching while the bus driver and a driver of a nearby truck shut the crazed attacker inside the bus with the mangled victim he walks up to the door holds the head in the door just looks at them crazy like and drops the head and walks back to the body and starts cutting more caton told cnn he and other passengers prevented the attacker from getting off the blood soaked bus by threatening him with makeshift weapons a hammer and a crowbar caton and other passengers said the attacker and his victim who was listening to music on headphones were sitting together at the rear of the bus and the attack appeared to be unprovoked no words were exchanged caton described the man who attacked the passenger as possibly asian or aboriginal bald and wearing sunglasses he seemed oblivious to others when the stabbing occurred said caton adding he was struck by how calm the man was caton said the victim boarded in edmonton was aboriginal in appearance was wearing hip hop clothing and appeared to be around 20 years of age
123656 mr caton who served five years in the canadian forces and was closest to the attacker paused before leaving torn momentarily between concern for his own safety and the thought of abandoning the bleeding victim he turned to another man nearby and asked for his help i said give me a hand and lets get this guy and the other guy took off he said it was only moments later that the victims screams went silent mr caton knew he was too late
123657 the man was left alone with the body and witnesses say that he performed further indignities to the victim we have word from people on the scene that when the killer was alone with the body that there may have been some small acts of cannibalism on the body oliver said oliver said that police have not confirmed that but have not denied it either
123658 matthis chiroux is the kind of young american us military recruiters love
123659 the next thing we do will depend on the answers to a couple questions what have we proven what resources do we have
123660 it sort of depends on what else people think we need to prove
123661 hey buddy 16th and guerrero says 17 can you top that
123662 of course i can top that im going to beat all the other offers ill do 20
123663 ok mob go out and reward adidas new balance and rockport but not asics
123664 uh there are a few of them i think id have to check
123665 im not sure it would be a wise precedent to set basically i need to prove that this concept will work and i also need to prove that the carrotmob brand can be trusted and that the indy non prof sort of cred is for real you know i need to be a trusted authority who makes deals between companies and consumers based on environmental merit and not on favoritism the street cred is super important the trust of the network is the most valuable asset carrotmob has right now soooo thats why im thinking its important that there are no confusing signals indicating that i have other corporate ties that are getting anyone access etc
123666 now that we are getting screwed things may have changed
123667 within any publicly held limited liability corporation the bottom line will always be the bottom line
123668 as we take a historical look at the corporation its essential to understand one thing that has made them unique its illegal for a corporation to behave in a socially responsible way unless that socially responsible behavior happens to be identical to the behavior that maximizes profit
123669 yay weve won we can go public and create an entire new outlook on consumerism
123670 i really hated doing this for a few years too but we raise a ridiculous amount of money this way if we held a vegan potluck instead we wouldnt break even

123676 for those using china as a production hub the chinese trade union as an arm of the state is yet another reason to search for an alternative
123677 it is also possible given the wording of the new labour contract law that resisting unionisation is illegal
123678 complicado esse fuso hoje acabei acordando s 5h da manh sem sono nenhum

123692 it was almost as if the siren was a call for the big man to show his strength
123693 we hoopten dat simac techniek en broadcast in de afgelopen jaren meer naar elkaar toe zouden groeien dat is echter niet gebeurd daarom is het beter voor het bedrijf dat een partij de leiding krijgt

123695 toby and flynn got stuck in the mud even flynn was stuck in the mud and toby was stuck in the mud and ike was stuck in the mud and toby was stuck in the mud
123696 the main driver behind fare increases will be the high oil price its very clear that the industry is going to have to reflect this high price
123697 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
123698 fuel prices have doubled in the past year a successful hedging programme mitigated the impact but nevertheless fuel costs at 706 million were up 233 million in the quarter

123706 one of the biggest challenges faced by project and resource managers is sharing resources across multiple projects each with their own demands for resource in the real world people often work on a many projects concurrently while also dealing with business as usual activities
123707 our goal was to make the job of managers as simple as possible so if they need to schedule someone they can check availability and skills match in real time taking into account other work the resources are schedule to do no other ppm software provides this level of usability right now
123708 der freund meiner mutter hatte die schwammerln gefunden und wir haben sonntagmittag alle drei davon gegessen
123709 dabei habe ich sogar noch gl ck gehabt weil das gift nerven und hirn nicht angreift sondern nur die magenschleimhaut
123710 aber es heilt alles wieder ab weil ich schnell genug im spital war
123711 zumindest bis zu diesem sonntag zurzeit habe ich aber berhaupt keinen gusto drauf und ich werde wohl auch in zukunft die finger v llig davon lassen
123712 maar ik heb besloten mezelf te verdedigen ik zal me hier verdedigen zoals ik dat tegen iedere natuurramp zou doen
123713 of vraagt u naar mijn andere adres waar ik met mijn andere identiteit woonde
123714 ik beschouw mijzelf een burger van het servische deel van bosni herzegovina montenegro en servi
123715 in 1996 kreeg ik van richard holbrooke de amerikaanse diplomaat die vredesonderhandelingen in bosni heeft geleid een aanbod ik moest me terugtrekken uit het openbare leven en een gebaar maken ik moest me zelfs uit het literaire leven terugtrekken in ruil daarvoor zouden de verenigde staten hun verplichtingen nakomen
123716 dat is volslagen nonsens dit is duidelijk een verzinsel van n van de ergste oorlogsmisdadigers

123718 het is zeer teleurstellend dat iemand hier binnenkomt en zomaar n van de meest spannende momenten van de spelen steelt

123721 four passengers have sustained injuries the cause of the fire is under investigation
123722 the ticket checking staff noticed the fire and alerted the driver and guards who stopped the train
123723 the fire spread to the other coaches due to wind
123724 lack of time prevented us from being able to address the outstanding concerns of one delegation
123725 no position has been taken by the security council on the question of whether to take any action in the light of the moreno ocampo proposal to indict president beshir
123726 the united states abstained in the vote because language added to the resolution would send the wrong signal to sudanese president beshir and undermine efforts to bring him and others to justice
123727 i want to give high marks to the british delegation
123728 they discussed in good faith with everybody they were very cooperative they tried to accommodate the concerns of major parties

123730 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
123731 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
123732 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
123733 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
123734 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
123735 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
123736 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
123737 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
123738 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
123739 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
123740 lets get free strategies for organizing the hip hop voting bloc
123741 before a lot of the songs about barack were supporting his campaign
123742 this song is different in that it almost claims the victory thats scary for some people who dont want to see that happen
123743 there is a community of people who arent watching cnn or reading the huffington post
123744 i will quit my duties in an honourable just and responsible manner as i have acted throughout my mandate i will then prove my innocence
123745 i dont believe there are many chances that a government led by kadima can be formed as the political world has entered such a zone of turbulence that it will be difficult to restore calm
123746 doing the best we can to do our part to take care of the environment
123747 at the same time we know that the deities want us to take care of ourselves to stand on our own two feet as individuals as families as a community as a nation
123748 epa is bending to the will of corporate financial and misguided political interests that will pollute new mexicos skies
123749 epas decision ignores its obligations to protect the health of residents and the environment in new mexico and the region we will not allow this ill advised decision to stand
123750 it is a devastating blow to tribal members who continually suffer from the large coal complex encroaching upon our land
123751 this one massive plant will negate the emissions reductions being implemented by the northeastern states in the first mandatory regional program to cut global warming pollution
123752 the administrations shameful decision rewards polluters flouts the clean air act and fails the american people
123753 risks are rising in cell phone handsets on which nec has pinned comeback hopes and pasolink the main driver of earnings to date
123754 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date
123755 its only inevitable that people from different countries and regions of the world dont see eye to eye on certain issues
123756 i dont think politicising the olympic games will do any good to address these issues
123757 it runs counter to the olympic spirit and also to the shared aspirations of the people of the world
123758 as always we will continue to provide facilities for foreign journalists coming to china to report
123759 of course we also hope the foreign reporters will abide by chinese laws and regulations
123760 we also hope you will provide objective reports of what you see here
123761 the implication is that foreign journalists should refrain from reporting stories that the government finds critical
123762 equate was looking for a system that enables seamless connectivity to its current sap portal and meets the companys objectives to facilitate training and workflow process development
123763 equate required a robust learning management system lms that would address these two key issues
123764 this system offers powerful and time saving features that help you quickly create and deliver courses and measure tangible results its modular architecture enables comprehensive access for seamless information sharing and you can choose components based on your needs for a feature packed system without expensive frills
123765 the nature of our operations require having a sophisticated and robust learning management system to deliver effective environment health amp safety eh amp s training operator certification programs as well as other e learning programs for employee development tis learning planet tm has met all our challenges and their service exceeded our expectations
123766 it seemed like it would give some of the people who worked for us more career options
123767 id love to be able to take credit for it but i dont think weve innovated too significantly i think you might even call it a happy accident
123768 ones competitive spirit is slightly piqued when someone else does well with a movie and you think why didnt we have that
123769 however when you stand back and look at it from a general point of view tell no one shows that this idea that people have stopped going to a certain kind of movie is just not right
123770 we have decided to move forward with a number of our productions and address any issues later as they arise
123771 everyone is working under the assumption that nothing will happen until there is an election and the results are known
123772 i think sag thought lets drag this into july and august lets force the studios to make a mistake maybe theyll impose maybe theyll lock us out and that will galvanize the members and then well get a strike vote that didnt happen

123774 business conditions for the automobile industry deteriorated sharply again in the second quarter
123775 the price level of pre owned cars in the usa and hence the level of revenues that can be generated on vehicles returned at the end of leases remained under further pressure
123776 this situation has made it necessary for the bmw group to increase its risk provision
123777 steep rises in oil and raw material prices the weakness of the us dollar the impact of the international financial crisis and a weaker us economy
123778 im currently packing up real quick to hop on a plane to new york for a second opinion but i wanted to let you all know first that there is no chance of me competing in beijing
123779 the timing is so unfortunate and this makes me more sad than anything
123780 after wednesdays match i knew there was something seriously wrong with my shoulder
123781 after taking a few different exams and mris the doctors found two small tears in the tendons of my shoulder
123782 there are so many mixed feelings because on wednesday night they were almost positive there was something wrong with my nerve which could have ultimately been much more serious
123783 but after thursday mornings tests for the first time in a while they were able to give me a different answer and a different problem
123784 this is something that needs a lot of time to heal it really hurts me to say i have to miss the olympics
123785 it has been a dream of mine ever since i was a little girl
123786 one of the things im really looking forward to is the opening ceremony and walking with athletes from my country in front of thousands of people

123789 sometime after launching our london house franchise we commissioned gordon patterson of fds southern to provide consultancy services it was an extremely beneficial exercise to our company our only regret was that we did not do it sooner
123790 we chose fds midlands franlink service to help with our recruitment due to their high professional standards and we have not been disappointed
123791 franlink have a thorough understanding of our franchise proposition and this helps them to match correctly the candidates for a mortgageforce franchise
123792 the groundwork undertaken by franlink is a major benefit to the recruitment team and i am looking forward to the relationship continuing well into the future
123793 it was good to have fds midlands to guide us right through the whole franchising process they were quick to understand our business and produced a carefully tailored package which continues to serve us very well indeed
123794 we found that fds midlands had a very practical no nonsense approach to franchising all their advice was extremely helpful and each stage of the project was completed strictly on schedule without such professional guidance we would definitely have been struggling instead we already have three franchises in place and many more in the pipeline
123795 we chose fds midlands for help with bringing our franchise to market and were delighted with the results the specific tasks we required were all completed within a couple of months and their quality was outstanding most importantly our consultant continued to make himself available answering further questions and providing additional advice long after completion of the actual work he went above and beyond the call of duty for us
123796 experienced business savvy individuals who can use our systems while maintaining our high standards
123797 we have a lot of long term business in that sector but clearly we are benefiting from current operations in iraq and afghanistan
123798 but the lackluster top line performance coupled with the overhang of the doj u s department of justice investigation is likely to somewhat offset the increased guidance
123799 we see those three in particular as markets wed like to add to our home market list
123800 the u s whether its mccain or obama are determined to maintain national security and their role in the world defense spending will stay at very very high levels
123801 we have six percent recall and we are too lazy to test ourselves
123802 our place is the only place in here that doesnt have an ac

123807 my business surpassed caremarks targets in its first year impressed by the speed in which my business was established i decided to invest in a second office which came on stream in march 2008 now the business is achieving record figures generating a weekly turnover between 14 000 and 16 000
123808 thanks to caremarks comprehensive training programme solid support network and my excellent staff in just four months i have already quadrupled my expected turnover and am way ahead of my business plan
123809 my business is steadily gathering momentum my success is due to the training which prepared me for my role the support from the support manager who visits regularly and when i need it the 24 hour phone support from head office and the md kevin lewis
123810 the people who come to ife are looking for franchises we can really do eyeball to eyeball interviews at shows like this
123811 its important for companies to exhibit at shows like the ife because you have a chance to connect with the prospects youve been speaking to
123812 so many times nowadays people visit websites submit an inquiry but you never have the chance to put a name and a face together at the ife well spend as much time as we need with each candidate and they have a chance to touch and see the concept so we really get the chance to connect one on one
123813 franchising is a great way to start your own business because youre not in business by yourself
123814 with franchising there is a team here to support you we have a whole system to help a franchisee get started we show them how to lay out the store how to market we give them training and ongoing support its everything they need to make their store more successful
123815 franchising is a great way to build your own business because youre in control
123816 it gives you the ability to leverage proven concepts and ideas and build it into something exciting for you and your family
123817 as a candidate its vital to attend these types of events and understand whats out there aside from just the concepts you have under consideration
123818 take a look around see whats out there and make an informed choice
123819 its packed with qualified entrepreneurs and produces great potential results for us and thats why we do events like this the people who come here are looking for franchises we can really do eyeball to eyeball interviews at shows like this
123820 the international franchise association and mfv expositions put the show together with the right timing the right space in an excellent facility and its convenient and comfortable to interview prospects here
123821 with so much information available on the internet the face to face handshake approach to attracting prospective franchisees is alive and well at trade shows
123822 we spoke with a number of qualified candidates at the expo and many of those were international visitors
123823 thats a benefit for our company as we focus on global expansion were placing an emphasis on our international growth and needed to be there to meet with the decision makers that attend the ife its a big part of why we exhibit
123824 the mid atlantic is a market we want to grow in so it was a natural choice to participate in the international franchise expo
123825 we had a great deal of interest from show visitors and spoke with a number of international visitors
123826 before the show we actively sent invitations out through our website and invited prospects from the area to visit with us at the ife
123827 we took advantage of the invitations provided by mfv the shows producer and invited our prospects through direct mail and our website
123828 for us a trade show is just one component of an overall strategy when were trying to penetrate a market so we use our existing lead base we tell them that were here we send them invitations and we use the expo as just one tool in our efforts to get our deals completed
123829 before the show we sent out an email invitation inviting our prospects
123830 in fact it worked out great because several visitors stopped by to thank us for the complimentary admission and it provided yet another opportunity to continue qualifying interested entrepreneurs
123831 after the ife we host an online interview and webinar with all the prospects that are interested in our concept
123832 we answer their questions discuss some of the details we may not have been able to cover on the show floor and then hope to close a franchise deal
123833 our post show follow up includes an e mail to all of the prospects weve spoken to along with a package of materials its important for them to have the information theyll need to make an informed decision

123843 at the beginning of january february i lost about 40 percent from april it started going to 50 to 60 percent
123844 the prices that farmers are getting for their corn or soybean or wheat are rising sharply but then that filters through into the wholesale and manufacturing level for bakeries and food companies that make everything from cheese to bread and it factors into the restaurant and to the retail level
123845 were not talking about the increased price of dairy or the cost of the gasoline thats gone up for our drivers or for the new cost of paper supplies all these other things
123846 im talking literally flour the increase in flour is 11 000 a week more right now so all year long before we raised the prices we just were swallowing that
123847 were busy but were just not breaking even at all
123848 so were hoping that this price increase i mean its a little bit too little too late but at least it will help us to make it through the year and sort of get back on our feet afterwards
123849 i would say that things will get worse in terms of food price cost over the next 12 months
123850 i think if you go out 24 36 months two or three years from now you may see some improvement

123963 has anyone collected data as to how many canadians new zealanders australians chinese japanese south americans etc have passports that was used to visit europe et al isnt it interesting how exclusively and carefully america is watched under the microscope while other nations are ignored all together
123964 stupid americans in order for you to actually see the impact that such a thing has on your population
123965 oh i dont hate americans but insult insult insult stereotype presumption assumption insult
123966 there is a big difference between being anti american and being critical of the united states
123967 the fundamental role of anti americanism in europe in general and particularly among those on the left is to absolve themselves of their own moral failings and intellectual errors by heaping them onto the monster scapegoat the united states of america the u s is charged with all the evils real or imagined that afflict humanity from the falling price of beef in france to aids in africa and global warming everywhere the result is a widespread refusal to accept responsibility for ones own actions
123968 anti americanism is hypocrisy at its finest you can spend your evening catching the latest episode of
123969 it all boils down to the fact that knowledge and intelligence are two different issues rote memorization of world capitals does not equate intelligence
123970 as an american please allow me to begin by asserting that our nation has had its strengths and its weaknesses its successes and its failures and its justices and injustices throughout history and continuing into the present although i sense much patriotism for my homeland i recognize our need for humility to understand that our country is not above questioning or reproach but is rather under the same standards as all other nations of the world i would simply like to ask those who view our country from afar to maintain a balanced perspective and realize too that there exists good and bad in america both in terms of its domestic society and politics as well as in its relations with other nations whilst there may be growing anti americanism in the united kingdom i do not believe such sentiment to be reciprocated on our side of the atlantic i viewed a recent survey that indicated most americans view england positively and never have i seen the flag of your country or any other foreign land for that matter burned in the streets of our cities clearly we as american citizens have not meant to be your enemies
123971 as someone who takes human rights seriously im appalled by the lack of sympathy the left feels toward the victims of any regime other than the bush administration lets shout it to prisoners everywhere if youre not harmed by an american your suffering doesnt count
123972 ambivalence antipathy and resentment toward and about the united states have comprised an important component of european culture since the american revolution at the latest thus way before america became the worlds mr big the proverbial eight hundred pound gorilla and a credible rival to europes main powers particularly britain and france while the politics style and discourse of the bush administration and of george w bush as a person have undoubtedly exacerbated anti american sentiment among europeans and fostered a heretofore unmatched degree of unity between elite and mass opinion in europe they are not cause indeed a change to a center left administration in washington led by a democratic president would not bring about its abatement let alone disappearance
123973 is euro disney land a threat to the french culture if french culture can be squashed by mickey mouse or more exactly by simply moving mickey geographically it would have to be disturbingly fragile
123974 anti americanism is the only face of xenophobia still broadly accepted in europe
123975 americans find themselves damned either way if they remain within their own borders they are isolationist hicks who are shirking their responsibilities if they intervene they are rapacious imperialists
123976 the british find it very difficult to come to terms with the loss of their global dominance we felt a deep sense of hurt and loss we used to run the world and we dont anymore so in order to palliate that insecurity we tend to run ourselves down too much and were also snooty about the people who do run the world
123977 it is tragic that anti american ideas are so easily passed through rumour while reconciliatory ideas and notions must be backed up with catalogues of evidence before they are even considered purely because of the fact that it is so much easier to hate than to keep an objective open mind
123978 other common anti american objections are ignorance and stupidity in dealing with these two i have no reason to suspect that the average american is any less intelligent than the average person from anywhere else one trait i have noticed is that other cultures are generally much more ashamed of any deficit in the intellect of the individual especially ours the british and as such will make a much greater attempt to hide it if all cultures bar one are scared of looking stupid and take action to prevent that happening then that one remaining culture is inevitably going to be lumbered with that image
123979 we became not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic different people different beliefs different yearnings different hopes different dreams
123980 most of the anti americanism these days stems from plain old nationalistic jealousy by a lot of countries that are born of insecurity about their own place in the world and their painful self awareness of their own failings and shortcomings like the kids in the next block who are jealous of the boy who has a better bicycle or a newer fancier skateboard phuque em all
123981 europeans like the rest of the world hate america and americans but love our aid when in distress and our soldiers to die for their countries you need to work live and pay taxes from this side of the atlantic to understand our vision of europe and the rest of the world
123982 unjustified hatred of americans there is much unjustified hatred in the world there is unjustified hatred of the usa much of this arises from the victimisation complex that sweeps much of mankind whoever is in charge whoever is powerful or successful will also be hated this immature hatred often evaporates quickly with a little reason or thought there are some some invalid unjustified criticisms the most widespread hate is the hate by people the world over who fall victim to their own shortcomings and want a scapegoat
123983 usa citizens are not given world news in the same way as most the other developed nations
123984 despite the usas dominance of mass media it is frequently only the pro usa self congratulatory messages that seem to arrive in europe the usa citizens criticism and disbelief of their own government is not apparent which gives the overall impression that americans are either gullible ignorant or honestly uncaring
123985 if a person outside of american culture is a hateful person they may actively hate and verbally attack america
123986 i think it is best when faced with people from other nations to treat them as individuals
123987 sometimes the caliber of a nation is found not in why it is liked but rather in why it is not
123988 everyone is in favor of free speech hardly a day passes without its being extolled but some peoples idea of it is that they are free to say what they like but if anyone says anything back that is an outrage
123989 with a military that has become a laughing stock and her increasing irrelevance in the world around her i believe that the canada i know and loved is gone

124009 we are very content with the results for the second quarter where our core profits have risen by nearly 20 for the second consecutive quarter as a result of our strategy and the initiatives we have adopted since q4 2007 the bank has shown great resilience in a challenging market environment we have continued to successfully increase our core income and profits while at the same time focusing on several cost cutting initiatives we estimate that these co ordinated efforts will start to bear real fruit in the second half of the year during the first half we have successfully raised eur 2 4 bn in funding while paying outstanding maturities of eur 2 1 bn at the same time we have maintained a strong cad ratio of 11 2 despite a severe weakening of the isk we have also been successful in deleveraging our balance sheet the banks liquidity position remains strong at eur 8 1 bn at the end of the quarter the bank launched a new international deposit product save amp save in norway and iceland which will be expanded into other markets in due course looking forward we will continue to focus on our core operations leveraging on the banks niche strategy and the positive outlook for the global food and energy sectors where we have a strong market presence in our immediate plans we do not expect the wholesale funding markets to improve in the near future with our strong asset quality intact we will continue to manage our balance sheet further diversifying our funding sources and deleveraging non core assets

124011 la hosting company dreamhost which hosts more than 700 000 web sites is encouraging its customers to use googles gmail for their e mail rather than the dreamhost mail servers
124012 just not something people are looking for from us and its something the big free email providers like yahoo microsoft and google can do better
124013 and given the way the market is at present responding very quickly to bad news it is likely to spark share selling
124014 i was expecting a downward revision from nissan so i was slightly surprised
124015 a further decline of used vehicle values in the united states remains a risk but so far a weaker than assumed yen exceeds that comfortably so were keeping our forecasts intact
124016 the commission has adopted a set of principles that protects consumers access to the internet
124017 we found that comcasts actions in this instance violated our principles
124018 meat is a prime example he says with so called
124019 why should i go back to only having one telly in the house i can afford 5
124020 they were the ideal three out of a number of famous cardiffians who have been through the eisteddfod
124021 it was a process of about eight or nine days to track them down matthew was the first to say yes then ioan and gethin
124022 i went to television centre in london to film with gethin still unsure if i could get a visa for america and that ioan and matthew were available for a days filming
124023 but i got the nod so off i went to la and with the help of a british man living there got hold of this fantastic house with stunning views to film
124024 there are a few different versions depending on the medium radio tv or online
124025 weve also done them for during the eisteddfod week when theyll be referring to particular things like the crowning and chairing ceremonies
124026 this is what i wanted but wasnt sure if i could get it its not often you get what you first wanted
124027 im very happy with the result and have had fantastic reviews and the promos have had so much coverage
124028 but now i am going to him who sent me yet none of you asks me where are you going
124029 and when he comes he will prove the world wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment

124032 were not supplied with updates on bird flu cases in humans anymore try tomorrow i can ask around
124033 we are concerned that the spread through migratory birds hasnt stopped once the virus is established in birds it is difficult to get rid of the virus and the risk to humans remains unless countries develop good control of transmission in birds
124034 we cant delude ourselves about the threat of pandemic influenza it has not diminished
124035 if that was a confirmed case we will have to work to understand what went wrong
124036 lijfstraffen mogen niet in nederland dus er zit een justiti le kant aan
124037 it was confirmed as h5n1 and thank god no case of human infection has been reported
124038 lijfstraffen mogen niet in nederland dus er zit een justiti le kant aan
124039 when we mapped out the pa subunit it looked very much like the head of a dragon
124040 one domain looked like the dragons brains and the other looked like its mouth
124041 if we can put a bit in the dragons mouth we can slow or even potentially someday stop the spread of avian flu
124042 since we are talking about a relatively small protein surface area finding a way to inhibit rna replication in h5n1 seems very feasible
124043 the result of the last diagnosis had casualtiess direction was attacked by the bird flu virus
124044 selang a day to the clinic my husbands mouth already did not feel apaapa lagi

124047 he said gak might be opened his case ama the hospital side
124048 all viruses rely on host cell proteins and their associated mechanisms to complete the viral life cycle identifying the host molecules that participate in each step of virus replication could provide valuable new targets for antiviral therapy
124049 we found genes proteins that are important for influenza virus replication we identified about 100 genes
124050 we took three and tested them and they were important for flu virus replication in humans
124051 i presume that many of the other genes we identified are also important for influenza virus replication in humans
124052 if you could inhibit block the interaction between those host proteins and influenza virus proteins you can inhibit virus replication this can be a target for development of new drugs

124061 he must have stabbed him 50 times or 60 times
124062 while we were watching he calmly walked up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stared at us and dropped the head right in front of us
124063 there was no rage in him and he wasnt swearing or cursing or anything it was just like he was a robot or something
124064 he was taunting police with the head in his hand out the window
124065 they want something to talk about there is no feud

124077 my motivation hasnt disappeared anywhere but of course its not nice when its not going so well but its not the first time we just keep pushing and at some point it starts going better again

124098 it will just be good to see this group thrive
124099 weve worked hard at it weve made some great strides it would be good to get that confirmation that we have made progress tomorrow night
124100 but if were sitting here tomorrow night having come second then youll probably suggest that weve made no progress whatsoever
124101 the sheer weight of numbers 1986 its an indicator of what it takes and obviously what weve brought in the past hasnt been enough and were conscious of that but really keen about that as well
124102 you hate missing any games but certainly i was really buoyed by the way the team played last week
124103 in sport you tend to find that those sort of hoodoos or a string of matches either won or lost but they always get broken eventually
124104 i suspect this weekend could be a grind it could be ugly but it will be intense and there will be drama
124105 we monitor and manage our weeks according to our state and i think these guys are probably in better shape now for this challenge than they would have been in week one or week two
124106 these guys will be up for this theyve got a challenge its very clear how significant that challenge is its obvious for all to see but theyre excited
124107 theyre standing at the foot of the hill and theyre ready to climb theyre just waiting for the whistle
124108 whatevers going to help him if thats what he needs then he should have a go at it
124109 i think weve got two months to discuss it but more unlikely at this stage
124110 i think this next step training with a club is a big one getting back into a club environment and back into a full routine
124111 it will be nice to get back to training and to get back to grass roots and see how the body feels it will be an important part of assessing where im at
124112 i dont talk to ben about football for his future i talk to him about how hes going and if he needs to talk to me or needs any advice from me he knows im there to talk to him
124113 a sad but perhaps not surprising indictment of boris johnsons priorities that the seventh member to join his senior policy team is the seventh white male
124114 i think its in the tory culture not to have many women in political life
124115 we dont know if hes going to drop the domestic violence programme and hes not even going to appoint an adviser on womens issues which i think is pretty serious
124116 women are still less likely than men to attain supervisory or managerial posts
124117 it was a complicated decision and an agonising time for me he had a better chance of winning the labour vote than me because he was a bigger name who was better known though im not sure if he was better qualified for it than me
124118 i got a lot of flak from other women about stepping aside as a woman in public life they would come up to me at meetings and be very angry about it
124119 i gave him a set of policies right from the beginning
124120 he had the courage to implement the congestion charge he was very nervous about it at the time and so many people around him were cautioning against it
124121 i have to admit that im not a great self promoter and i think thats a female thing women always speak less and more to the point we are more interested in the doable the practical when i got involved in party politics as a haringey councillor in 1986 and there were just six women to 50 men in the labour group i chose planning as my area partly because men are more interested in being chairs of committees which have budgets
124122 part of me always wanted to be a film maker which interestingly my younger daughter sarah who directed the film adaptation of brick lane is its funny how your children live out your unscripted lives
124123 my childhood exposed me to the unfairness and hardship of life because my mother was so unable to shape things herself buffeted by history and circumstances so much the victim of discrimination
124124 i put my career on hold because i wanted to do a good job on bobs kids and he wanted a lot of support at home while he was running his business
124125 i got on well with tony but i tend to get on with people
124126 my new job is scrutinising boris and im going to give him a hard time if he doesnt deliver on affordable housing climate change child poverty and womens issues
124127 ultimately the goal is to provide emergency managers with a range of possibilities as to what may happen as the result of a storm and this approach shows great promise
124128 were playing russian roulette in some sense with these storms coming up the coast
124129 if we have a high tide or spring high tide when we have one of these events then were in trouble
124130 the vulnerability of the area speaks for itself as weve already had cases of flooding
124131 when coupled with sea level rise its not going to take much of a storm to cause flooding as we go into the coming decades so we are working to provide better forecasting of these events in the future

124147 it wont be long until some newspaper commissions a poll
124148 ambition is the name of the game david miliband should be applauded i think hes playing the game like a pro
124149 i think david miliband will make a good leader of the labour party at some point
124150 i am a big david miliband fan and i hope he gets the top job
124151 the war struck at the heart of everything british liberals believed in several cabinet ministers resigned and asquith the master of domestic politics proved a poor war leader lloyd george and churchill however were zealous supporters of the war and gradually forced the old pacifist liberals out
124152 almost as hilarious as charless postings is the fact that milliband cant seem to look anyone in the eye when answering a question
124153 the foreign secretary has always abstained on issues of a more transparent parliament
124154 i support duff gordon in the forthcoming labour party leadership election because
124155 so milliband is not only at the hobbesian end of social engineering he is frequently wrong
124156 beware of that two handed engine that waits at the door to smite once and smite no more
124157 only nutty untill compared to purple dogzz now then youre really talking
124158 if milliband becomes pm and des not deliver radical change and abandon unpopular policies labour will be out
124159 see the tories are out in force terrified on this one
124160 we do not like their ideas we do hear them and we reject what they say
124161 if there is a miliband poll bounce which is quite likely given the favourable publicity hes had and the extraordinary unpopularity of the prime minister
124162 well id need about 6 months with all the documents in front of me
124163 no doubt the majority on the board are right wing ranters
124164 i want less sleaze and less of the gravy train
124165 none of the tory sleaze of the 1990s no cash for questions we will institute strict laws on party funding
124166 since you only have a uk parliament you have far more than 2 opposition parties oh i do love the arrogance of some english it makes the job in scotland so much easier
124167 just pointing out that we have two opposition parties led by men who look like schoolchildren
124168 is it more likely the government wasnt in the wrong or was it more likely that the government had a doctor assassinated bribed two independent judges and managed to pull the wool over the eyes of the media

124172 please tell your mp i wont repeat my 287 but suggest you read it and consider whether thats a possible way forward
124173 my view is that gordon browns sense of purpose teamwork and the long long view
124174 anyone can shout for call for prey for an election any time they wish i know i did in 1994 5 6 etc but had to wait the full 5 years just like that im afraid fact not opinion
124175 nick robinsons blog is a detailed and thorough analysis of whether a new chancellor is needed and worth reading for that
124176 i agree with nick robinson that as journalists we will be sorry to see mr bush go he gives great quote
124177 nick robinson has an interesting take on why it david davis resignation may be bad for the conservatives
124178 nick robinson reports on a flurry of interest in jacqui smith as prime minister and the picture he paints is quite convincing
124179 thats it im off on my hols rarely have i gone away so uncertain what the next few months will

124188 american drivers are counting on congress to lift the ban and so are american workers
124189 the low approval rating for democratic leaders in congress is not likely to put the partys control of congress in jeopardy
124190 there is no indication in any poll taken by any organization that voters want to see the gop regain control of congress and all generic ballot questions show a wide lead for democratic congressional candidates

124198 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
124199 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
124200 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
124201 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
124202 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
124203 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
124204 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
124205 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
124206 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
124207 lets get free strategies for organizing the hip hop voting bloc

124239 hier gemacht hat das kann man nur als durchgeknallt bezeichnen
124240 es ist v llig absurd und parteisch dlich jemanden wie wolfgang clement auszuschlie en
124241 einen kurs der die mitte w hler der spd bindet
124242 die fr her bei helmut schmidt waren die gerhard schr der dann gebunden hat die clement gebunden hat
124243 noch mehr w hler in der mitte die sie ja dringend braucht um doch wieder aus dem umfragetief herauszukommen
124244 nach allem was wir in der vergangenheit haben sehen k nnen w rde ich jede wette eingehen dass die zahlen f r die spd noch einmal deutlich zur ckgehen und dass das wirklich ein parteisch digendes verhalten ist was hier einige an den tag legen
124245 als jurist muss ich sagen ist der ausschluss vermutlich unproblematisch das parteiengesetz gibt relativ enge voraussetzungen unter denen eine partei ihre mitglieder ausschlie en kann und diese voraussetzungen sind bei clement mit sicherheit erf llt
124246 und da sind dinge zu ber cksichteigen wie die biografie der werdegang des mitglieds die verdienste um die partei aber eben eventuell auch der politische schaden den ein ausschluss hervorruft
124247 nat rlich problematisch weil clement ein sehr profiliertes und ein sehr prominentes mitglied der spd ist
124248 die stuttgarter wollten ihn partout nicht abgeben dabei sind 25 millionen euro plus x ja kein pappenstiel
124249 wenn wir flamini und hleb um jeden preis gewollt h tten w ren beide spieler jetzt bei uns
124250 beides sind wunderbare sympathische offene burschen die sehr gut zum fc bayern passen weil sie sehr popul r sind
124251 aber am ende muss der ball ins tor was bringt mir der liebste schwiegersohn wenn er nicht trifft
124252 er muss die em leistungen aus dem t rkei oder portugalspiel ber einen langen zeitraum zeigen dann wird er hier keine probleme haben
124253 ich werde mir alles anh ren und w rde momentan sagen beides ist m glich entweder bin ich dann weg oder ich bleibe f r immer nein f r sagen wir ganz lange

124256 its a fantastic deal for us its great to have the type of player ive been looking for for a while
124257 its fantastic the chairman has backed my judgement again and weve brought in a player whos exactly what we need
124258 while he was doing his medical we were sorting out a deal with his mum and his representative
124259 it was a breath of fresh air to have someone who was so keen to get going
124260 he did have other options but as soon as i had a chat with him i realised he was the one i wanted in my dressing room and on our pitch
124261 if somebody finds space in the penalty area and can finish he will do that as its something thats natural to him
124262 hes a great athlete but he has got that ability to find space in the penalty area and thats what we want
124263 world football has seen tremendous development under the leadership of mr blatter we are happy for his support to the development of vietnamese football
124264 we would like to speed up the development of vietnamese football under the afc leadership i hope that asian football will be able to compete with the rest of the world soon
124265 the vff are working very hard for the development and with the support of you and your government they will achieve results
124266 vietnam have talent but need your help to create infrastructure this will surely improve the level of football in this country we fifa and afc can only offer help but you have to develop your own football
124267 football is not only about kicking a ball football touches all aspects of the society including cultural social emotional et al and this can be a national identity you have to make football mirror of vietnamese society
124268 in asia we value your support and your third visit to this country is a testimony of your support to asian football
124269 is the fact that its a monarchy meant to be omnious
124270 im not afraid of sci fi and i love it
124271 we didnt want to do this as a space opera we wanted it to be a familiar world but at the same time we are inventing a world we had a lot of fun inventing what this world is going to look like we are taking new york and impressing our own aesthetic and own iconography we got to have a lot of fun with that i remember talking to david eick about this when he was doing battlestar and he said they were always asking themselves the question what do doorknobs looks like we decided that we wanted to have things look like they could fit in our worlds but youre not sure what city it is
124272 i look at it as the hand of faith guiding the heroes
124273 im curious to see how people perceive that the ongoing discussions when people see it are is that magic did something just happen beyond physics is it something special or luck i wont answer that and will let people interpret that

124282 nobody is going to trust the north korean number they have given on plutonium they made
124283 the ball is in the north korean court and we will see what they come up with
124284 in the battle of iraq the united states and our allies have prevailed
124285 doing the best we can to do our part to take care of the environment
124286 at the same time we know that the deities want us to take care of ourselves to stand on our own two feet as individuals as families as a community as a nation
124287 epa is bending to the will of corporate financial and misguided political interests that will pollute new mexicos skies
124288 epas decision ignores its obligations to protect the health of residents and the environment in new mexico and the region we will not allow this ill advised decision to stand
124289 it is a devastating blow to tribal members who continually suffer from the large coal complex encroaching upon our land
124290 this one massive plant will negate the emissions reductions being implemented by the northeastern states in the first mandatory regional program to cut global warming pollution
124291 the administrations shameful decision rewards polluters flouts the clean air act and fails the american people
124292 this was even more exciting than we had expected it to be we had finished our matches and counted and counted when the last matches were sailed but we thought that we could make it
124293 of course we feel a little unhappy being so very close to getting another chance in the event but weve had great fun and weve learned a lot making a lot of things work easier onboard
124294 we gated in from port but wanted to get to the starboard side of the course that was really difficult to achieve now we are aiming for the new matches everyone is important
124295 we threw away all our advantages in choosing the wrong way up the course
124296 our next goal is to reach the semi finals which we expect to do so far we have placed second in lysekil twice and we hope to do better this year
124297 the united way of palm beach county and the south florida fair do this once a year
124298 it was great we got 500 for a days work
124299 during the summer months funds tend to dwindle but our cause and mission continues to grow
124300 this helped us raise much needed funds in order for fso to be able to continue our mission this summer by sending a little bit of home to our soldiers overseas to assure theyre not forgotten
124301 this fundraiser could not have come at a better time unfortunately funds have been at a shortfall
124302 its so wonderful to see a local corporation such as florida power amp light and their employees continue to show their support of our troops overseas
124303 die t r f r ein weiteres quake ist nicht komplett geschlossen ich w rde sagen dass wahrscheinlich der erfolg von quake live entscheidet ob wir ein neues quake projekt machen

124305 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
124306 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
124307 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
124308 i didnt wanna make it into an issue so i said
124309 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
124310 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
124311 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
124312 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
124313 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
124314 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
124315 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
124316 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
124317 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
124318 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
124319 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
124320 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
124321 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
124322 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
124323 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
124324 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
124325 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
124326 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
124327 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
124328 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
124329 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty

124332 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
124333 you have value on the ground more than you spent
124334 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
124335 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
124336 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
124337 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
124338 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
124339 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
124340 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
124341 on the design specific aspects of the application who our vendor is can make a lot of difference as to what technology we use for the design
124342 so when we didnt have the final vendor we werent able to answer the questions to either ours or the nrcs level that we wanted to answer those questions so we asked them to hold up on the review of the design specific parts of the application
124343 they did about 30 000 man hours of due diligence with toshiba to determine their abilities and as they did this due diligence they determined that not only are they capable of building the units to the standards that we expect but they are exceptionally able to build them to the highest standards
124344 toshiba has been lead contractor on two of the units built in japan and subcontractor on a third one
124345 when she made it clear she didnt want to have anything to do with him he became enraged
124346 after they made a deal they were following her to another motel room when they were approached by three males from behind and forced into a room at gunpoint
124347 its an honor to represent the country i am proud to serve
124348 the army has not only provided me with the training and opportunities to succeed it has given me the encouragement i need to go for the gold at the olympics
124349 ive been with the program since 1997 and now i get to represent my country in the olympics the army allows you to dream big
124350 we coach elite level athletes who already have a high level of discipline from their army experience
124351 by providing these athletes with the best training coaching equipment and overall support the army is preparing them for victory at the olympics and beyond

124356 we have already agreed in principle on a number of important details for example with respect to the timeframe capacity profile and transfer price principles that will apply once we have reached a final agreement on dissolving the joint venture
124357 we have also agreed on a framework for arriving at a final decision on inoteras future ownership but this is all that we can comment on now

124368 newcastle united can confirm that it has received documentation from the football association stating that it is charging joey barton with misconduct in relation to the incident that occurred with ousmane dabo in may 2007 at a time when he was a registered player of manchester city
124369 the club has sought clarification from the football association as to why this decision has been reached now given the incident occurred nearly 15 months ago
124370 the main driver behind fare increases will be the high oil price its very clear that the industry is going to have to reflect this high price
124371 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
124372 fuel prices have doubled in the past year a successful hedging programme mitigated the impact but nevertheless fuel costs at 706 million were up 233 million in the quarter
124373 at 12 10am on wednesday we received a third party allegation that a photographer had been spat at by an individual outside a restaurant in hanway street w1

124375 the alleged suspect a 22 year old male was spoken to by police

124387 die zeichen stehen weiterhin auf wachstum aber r ckl ufige investitionsaktivit ten werden sich in den n chsten monaten auf die wirtschaft auswirken
124388 sterreichs jungunternehmer sehen mit optimismus in ihre gesch ftliche zukunft aber eines ist klar auch sie sp ren den sch rferen wind im wirtschaftsleben das belegt die umfrage eindeutig die jungen sind die gradmesser f r die heimische wirtschaft und der zeigt es besteht rascher handlungsbedarf nur dann kann kann der schwung mitgenommen werden
124389 das erwartete h here sparaufkommens macht es deutlich investitionsfreundlichere bedingungen f r jungunternehmer m ssen endlich umgesetzt werden die politik darf den jungen nicht den wind aus den unternehmersegeln nehmen im gegenteil sie muss sie mit einer frischen wachstumsbrise beleben
124390 die politik muss finanzierungen und f rderungen f r junge unternehmen bereitstellen sowie den zugang zum kapital erleichtern das ist eine investition in die zukunft des wirtschaftsstandorts sterreich die mehrfach an den staat zur ckkommt und sich bezahlt macht
124391 nur mit optimismus alleine kann man kein unternehmen f hren die rahmenbedingungen f r ein sicheres und langfristig erfolgreiches unternehmertum muss der staat schaffen gerade auch f r jungunternehmer die haben den mut und den drive f r neues denn wenn nicht die jungen wer dann
124392 die jungen brauchen ein wachstumspaket und darin muss enthalten sein streichung der lohnnebenkosten f r den ersten mitarbeiter im ersten jahr senkung des stammkapitals bei gmbh gr ndungen auf 10 000 euro und einf hrung eines freibetrags f r kapitalgeber in h he von 50 000 euro

124394 diese behauptung ist glatter humbug die von dem fp politiker einmal mehr ausgeblendete realit t sieht nat rlich v llig anders aus
124395 der fp klubobmann vergleicht auch in diesem bereich pfel mit birnen
124396 dass die rechnung von fp klubobmann schock somit schlichtweg falsch ist

124399 die wiener sp und die stadtregierung orientieren sich in der integrationspolitik an den tats chlichen bed rfnissen der menschen und stellen im sinne eines friedvollen zusammenlebens und des aufeinanderzugehens der menschen das gemeinsame ber das trennende ganz im gegensatz zur fp die selbst davor nicht zur ckschreckt mit unrichtigen behauptungen zu versuchen die menschen gegeneinander auszuspielen um politischen kleingeld zu m nzen
124400 the discovery has enormous implications for the large scale deployment of solar since it puts us on the doorstep of a cheap and easily manufactured storage mechanism
124401 using common and affordable elements and a glass of water these chemists may have given us a future way to efficiently obtain oxygen by splitting water
124402 ich sehe darin eine wertsch tzung f r die leistungen der unternehmerinnen unseres bundeslandes es ist aber auch eine wertsch tzung f r die arbeit die der sozialdemokratische wirtschaftsverband n und seine bezirksteams in den letzten jahren f r die kleinen und mittleren unternehmen und ihre mitarbeiterinnen erbracht haben
124403 unsere standpunkte werden wir auch in die kommende wahlauseinandersetzung einbringen
124404 besonders am herzen liegen mir eine steuerliche entlastung der klein und mittelbetriebe sowie der bezieherinnen niedriger und mittlerer einkommen ebenso wichtig sind eine bessere soziale absicherung f r unternehmerinnen und eine noch st rkere hilfestellung f r junge betriebe
124405 mir geht es darum dass vor allem den anliegen der kleinen unternehmen und der betriebsgr nderinnen noch mehr aufmerksamkeit geschenkt wird daher sehe ich jede erhaltene vorzugsstimme nicht nur als pers nliche unterst tzung sondern auch als unterst tzung f r unsere forderungen
124406 molterer und bartenstein brauchen sich jetzt keine sekunde lang als retter der aua aufspielen sie haben durch ihr herumlavieren monatelang gute l sungen im sinn der besch ftigten und im sinn des unternehmens verz gert
124407 dass molterer bartenstein und auch das aua management jetzt derart druck machen und damit ngste bei den aua besch ftigten sch ren scheint mir ein reines ablenkungsman ver
124408 vp chef molterer hat sich jahrelang nicht darum gek mmert was aus der aua und den besch ftigten werden soll daf r ist unter seiner verantwortung als f r die iag zust ndiger finanzminister das aua management von drei auf f nf manager aufgestockt worden und noch im fr hling gab es jubelmeldungen dass der turn arround geschafft und eine stand alone l sung m glich sei und nur wenige woche sp ter soll das alles nicht mehr gelten und die jubelmeldungen brechen in sich zusammen solche sachen versteht die bev lkerung nicht und die betroffenen besch ftigten schon gar nicht
124409 ein voreiliger 100 prozentiger verkauf der gr ten heimischen fluglinie ist besch ftigungspolitisch und volkswirtschaftlich v llig daneben solche schnellsch sse k nnen gro en schaden anrichten
124410 nehmen wir uns die zeit die allerbeste l sung f r die aua ihre besch ftigten und den standort zu finden alles andere ist verantwortungslos
124411 forderungen aufstellen ist das eine im land etwas bewegen das andere
124412 nieder sterreich hat im bundesl ndervergleich in punkto kinderbetreuung die vorreiterrolle eingenommen denn nur in nieder sterreich k rnten und jetzt auch in der steiermark ist der gratiskindergarten am vormittag realit t auch die kosten f r kinderbetreuung am nachmittag liegen mit bis zu maximal 80 euro pro kind im bundesl nder ranking im unteren bereich hier wird sozial gestaffelt wenn eltern finanzielle unterst tzung seitens des landes brauchen
124413 mit der kindergartenoffensive setzt nieder sterreich einen familienpolitischen meilenstein denn bis 2010 wird es zus tzlich 10 000 kindergartenpl tze geben so viele betreuungspl tze wurden noch nie innerhalb so kurzer zeit geschaffen
124414 auch der rechnungshof best tigt nieder sterreich eine erfolgreiche familienpolitik und w rdigt das angebot f r die 0 bis 3 j hrigen weiters sind 97 der eltern die ein kind in einem n landeskindergarten haben mit der p dagogischen betreuung zufrieden
124415 die technisch alle ber hmten hochalpenstra en in den schatten stellt
124416 ein noch vor der nationalratswahl durchgepeitschter notverkauf der austrian airlines ist verantwortungslos und das gegenteil eines professionellen zukunftskonzeptes f r die f r das land so wichtige luftlinie
124417 sterreichs arbeitnehmerinnen haben in den vergangenen jahren nur negative erfahrungen mit ideologisch motivierten privatisierungen gemacht ich denke da an die austria tabak wo es zum abbau hunderter arbeitspl tze gekommen ist v llig unverst ndlich ist es dass trotz unver nderter rahmenbedingungen nun diese panikreaktion notwendig sein soll im april hie es noch die aua stehe finanziell gut da nun versucht man in erpresserischer weise eine entscheidung durchzusetzen
124418 dieses agieren ist wirtschaftspolitisch verantwortungslos und f hrt bei den besch ftigten zu gro er verunsicherung die gpa djp steht hinter den besch ftigten und wird alles tun um eine zukunftsweisende und nachhaltige l sung f r das unternehmen im interesse der besch ftigten zu finden
124419 die jetzige unternehmensf hrung hat nach den letzten vorkommnissen auf allen linien versagt die besch ftigten sind mit recht emp rt
124420 es ist zeit f r eine politik der verantwortung des vertrauens der neuen sachlichkeit des logischen hausverstandes es ist zeit f r eine politik der arbeit auf die unsere landsleute in zukunft mit recht wieder stolz sein k nnen 86 pers nlichkeiten 30 mehr als bei der letzten nationalratswahl 2006 haben sich bereit erkl rt sich in den dienst einer neuen idealistischen politik f r die steirerinnen und steirer zu stellen
124421 die menschen haben die derzeitigen schmutzk belkampagnen satt der stillstand der streit und der hader von sp und vp haben unser land an den rand des abgrundes gef hrt die verantwortungslosigkeit die molterer faymann und co ausgestrahlt haben finden ihre spiegelbilder in der steirischen landespolitik wieder auf der strecke bleiben die menschen mit ihren sorgen ngsten und n ten eine horrorinflation die die steirerinnen und steirer an die inflation der 20iger jahre des vorigen jahrhunderts erinnert treibstoffpreise die sich kein mensch mehr leisten kann explodierende nahrungsmittelpreise die unsere mitmenschen reihenweise in die armut treiben und eine verantwortungslose politik die dieser abw rtsspirale unt tig zusieht sind f r uns grund genug verantwortung zu bernehmen

124470 i will not give the administration an excuse for its failure
124471 im not going to be diverted for a political tactic from a course of action that has a big picture view a vision about an energy independent future that reduces our dependence on fossil fuels and focuses on those renewables that are protective of the environment
124472 a solid majority of americans want us to have more drilling for more american made energy and they arent going to take no for an answer
124473 speaker pelosi senators harry reid and barack obama are defying the will of the american people and theyre doing so at their own risk
124474 republicans feel like they have an opening because of the gas price issue to push for domestic drilling but we havent seen any empirical evidence or tangible evidence that its hurting democrats
124475 maybe this fall the issue will develop into a republican advantage but i dont see that were there yet
124476 its a battle of messages between the two parties more than an anvil around the necks of democrats

124516 i was sitting in the lecture where there were about 30 or 40 people but i saw some taking out their phones and taking pictures of me i decided it was getting too crowded so i went outside
124517 i went into the street and they started to follow me i saw them sending text messages and calling more people there were more and more crowds i was about to cross the street and a car mounted the pavement
124518 more cars came and people were following me shouting it was a riot
124519 the police car turned into the street and as soon as i saw the marked car i started shouting police help me help me the police asked what was going on and i said they were trying to kill me

124535 its an unfortunate situation but we came out pretty unscathed
124536 dickson came and met with isu athletic director jamie pollard and made the offer
124537 were going to have more years of chaos and uncertainty and it would adversely impact the education of des moines children
124538 i dont need anyone to speak for me jonathan has shown his support for me and thats fine but i am nobodys candidate but my own
124539 no personal attacks have ever educated a kid my focus is going to be on improving the education system for the children of des moines
124540 the community needs to have a better idea of whats going on in the district
124541 we get the fluff but we dont get the nuts and bolts
124542 i think are teachers are extraordinary and we have great programs but id like to see to administration be a little more welcoming to parents and answer their concerns in a more timely fashion
124543 its about the economic vitality of the city of des moines
124544 i want people to know where were spending money in the district and what were spending it on
124545 we need to continue to offer the most educational choices for families of any school district in iowa and add to those offerings so that we are a destination for parents looking for a community in which to raise and teach their children
124546 i feel like theres a disconnect between the district and parents
124547 whatever happens we need to get more parents involved in the school district again
124548 improving elementary reading skills is a key component to improving graduation rates in the future
124549 thats what is cool about it because you get to see when a kid that has never played before make a goal
124550 we get to feel what it is like winning games
124551 i just really believe that its important to get people out and get people to care about their community
124552 i want things to be as safe as possible for my kids
124553 i think its a good opportunity for neighbors to get together it gives us an opportunity with our busy schedules to talk to each other
124554 its fun for the kids to climb up on the fire engines
124555 given the magnitude of our challenges youd think wed be having a serious debate but so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton and britney spears
124556 i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with
124557 im disappointed because i think this is a time where the american people deserve a really rigorous debate about how were going to move the country forward and make their lives better
124558 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
124559 i think iowas a purple state and i think weve got a terrific chance to win
124560 i think there really are serious consequences if we do not deal with these pressing needs
124561 people need homes they need jobs were going to have a mental health crisis statewide if we dont address these types of needs its sad to say but its likely well see more suicides and things like that as people continue to be stressed and strained
124562 im comfortable with the reconsideration because this is the last retail spot in the business park and the city will seek office space going forward
124563 it is very definitely family oriented and a facility id like to see in urbandale
124564 this space is best used for class a job creating space
124565 if we fall for this bait and switch technique why did we do a comprehensive plan in the first place
124566 its a destination point that brings people to the area its a family center
124567 it begins by thinking through the planning so the material you order for a project is exact and you dont end up with a lot of excess
124568 those materials can be recycled at the end of the project
124569 gypsum is a natural mineral that farmers use as a soil expander
124570 weve been working in california on a project that dealt with green projects and it is a big focus for us but its time to also get involved with what we are doing locally
124571 its fun and the reason i like this program is because it teaches the basics about the bible
124572 how do you not see the tree until youre right up on it
124573 i feel like if you dont put cones up thats just horrible karma
124574 he asked her if she had a drivers license and she said she didnt have one
124575 and he looked at me and said oh i think shes been through enough i just felt like he didnt care
124576 as property owners we felt like we had no rights
124577 our best case scenario is to spend thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours just to get it back to the way it was

124583 if you didnt get a chance to see this building a month and a half ago theres been tremendous changes we had mud that thick through the building

124585 i had asked for two additional personnel during the budget process earlier this year and i ended up hiring one now and will hire the other halfway through the year
124586 my intention is to expand coverage to seven days a week that will create 24 hour coverage on weekends and holidays in johnston
124587 we rely on paid on call personnel who are called in during those hours and thats ok because statistically those are not typically hours where we are busy
124588 we now have five full time firefighters and the chief and 25 paid on call firefighters
124589 how many of you have ever done a dance called the chicken dance
124590 raise your hand if you were in a row over there
124591 we just have to make it really easy for them

124593 we find it unfortunate for our viewers and their subscribers
124594 its only been in the past 10 days that weve been in any serious negotiations
124595 its not us pulling their signal its them pulling their signal so we cant retransmit that signal
124596 we sat on the runway well not the runway the cement part before you get to the runway and we didnt move
124597 it was over an hour it was hot they wouldnt let us get up and move around i really had to go to the bathroom and i told the stewardess she said i just had to sit there and wed be leaving in a few moments but we didnt move i thought i was going to bust
124598 my husband and i were on this plane and these two babies were screaming they were right behind us it went on all the way to san francisco then it got bumpy and people started to get sick and the flight attendants wouldnt come
124599 we had a huge issue with razamatazz we addressed that and its gone we wanted to make sure something similar does not happen again
124600 just trying to put everything back together the way it was may not be the best idea for us in the long term
124601 we had just bumped up a lot of our test scores
124602 well look at how our student enrollment disburses across the district before we make any decisions about facilities
124603 every person thats the word used in the constitution deserves due process
124604 we spent a lot of time trying to make sure they understood it
124605 instead of offering any real plan to lower gas prices senator mccain touts his support for george bushs plan for offshore oil drilling
124606 its almost incomprehensible in this day and age that a process would take this long
124607 we have tens of thousands of people in this state that are hurting
124608 if wed had to go and get permission to send out those troops people would have died
124609 we cant give them definitive answers until we know what kind of support were going to get from washington in terms of financial assistance
124610 federal officials need to step up to the plate and tell us yes we will come through with 2 billion 3 billion 4 billion whatever it is
124611 im waiting for you to become president so i can get that scholarship thing you were talking about otherwise im going to go insane
124612 now is the time for america to stand by those who have suffered so much while helping them get back on their feet
124613 were penalized for having a clean balance sheet and thats wrong
124614 we havent taken a full blown vacation in several years
124615 its profitable and we have a good time doing it but i dont know what id do if we didnt do this
124616 nobody has any idea what it takes to do this
124617 the best weather for ice cream is 80 to 90 degrees
124618 we have to start making them about nine days out its also a time sensitive novelty so if we start too far out the cookie crumbs get moist
124619 its like a regular grocery store but with two aisles
124620 it has everything you can imagine from aspirin to charcoal lighters
124621 we bring in canned goods cereals spices and so on
124622 if at any time you believe you are not receiving the full cooperation of the university of iowa employees and others
124623 we are hopeful that university employees and others will fully cooperate with this new investigation iowans deserve nothing less
124624 we will be doing exactly as the board directed on the reimbursement of board office costs for stolar partnership at the time of the reimbursement i will inform the board office of the exact sources used
124625 det r s m nga som fildelar i dag att det inte k nns fel
124626 as we indicated last night after detailed discussion we have concluded that the conditions notably financial are not in place today
124627 this does not put into question our investment projects internationally and in particular in the u k we have the intention to be a major actor in the u k nuclear market we have been working on this for three years
124628 ten writers were invited to respond with texts to the enigma of the fortress these texts have been translated into italian german and english interpreted by a theatre director spoken by actors and acoustically situated within listening stations designed by a sound artist the listening stations have been sited at different locations within the grounds and buildings of fortezza franzensfeste thus the fortress speaks these texts to the visitor
124629 we can win the next election weve got to do that in two ways set out a very clear vision about how our values are right for the country and how we can take the country forward and set out the weaknesses in the conservative case
124630 for heavens sake lets get serious of course we can win with gordon as our leader
124631 we have got to stop sounding miserable about ourselves and sounding as if we have been treated unfairly we havent been treated unfairly
124632 we are not doing well enough its what the voters have said to us we have got to focus on how we can do better
124633 i think we are going through tough times i always feel that tough times do not last long but that tough people do i think gordon brown is a tough man

124640 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
124641 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
124642 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
124643 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
124644 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
124645 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
124646 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
124647 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
124648 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
124649 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
124650 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
124651 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
124652 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
124653 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
124654 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
124655 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
124656 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
124657 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
124658 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
124659 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
124660 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
124661 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
124662 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
124663 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
124664 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
124665 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
124666 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
124667 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
124668 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
124669 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
124670 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
124671 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
124672 this reminds me of my fathers last words dont son its loaded

124683 but we need to know where every nickel is spent
124684 so many times you hear that vta is going bankrupt
124685 no were not going bankrupt were financially stable were moving in the right direction
124686 i always felt the revenue projections were so loose they would flop around and were tied to the political environment you cannot allow that to happen and have the public trust you
124687 but say it doesnt were still under a lot of pressure to get a park that is our own that isnt going to go away so my hope is that well find a way to make it happen it has not been as easy as i thought it would be
124688 to lew i think it seems like theyre delaying things
124689 in lews mind i think he thinks theyre not being entirely reasonable im not super worried but im concerned i think its important that we get the issues resolved so that we can move forward
124690 but the problem is we cant give them exactly what they want
124691 im very pleased with how well the obama people are getting their people out
124692 i have stood on stage with him in 22 debates but whos counting
124693 i have seen his passion and determination his grace and his grit his own life exemplifies the american dream
124694 but now it is time for us to unite and together stand up and say no more of the republican ideology
124695 i respect his many accomplishments my differences with him are not personal
124696 they are with the policies he has proposed because while he legitimately can tout moments of independence from his party in the past such independence isnt characteristic of his presidential campaign
124697 so she can partially forgive me for not supporting her losing candidate
124698 all of us are on the same team again everyone has worked hard on the clinton event
124699 and on the flip side for obamas august 17 event the clinton people are pulling through
124700 she is saying we are going take no prisoners and try and beat this back before it qualifies
124701 there may well be people who think madison nguyen is not the right person but the time to make that decision is at the next election
124702 what exactly does it feel like to run 100 kilometers in one day the acclaimed japanese author and fanatical marathoner discovers that it will change your life for ever and in ways you could never imagine
124703 i heard the dogs barking and a lot of screaming and then all of a sudden it stopped
124704 the kids came over banging on the door saying their house was on fire and i said where is your mother
124705 i was always telling her what was she doing with him i didnt really like him he didnt have a job or a car
124706 she was saying she was dying and moaning somebody call 911 somebody talk to me she then just laid down
124707 she was very nice very quiet paid her rent on time
124708 my husband makes a decent living but to live in santa clara valley it takes over 100 000
124709 the parties agreed four years ago to stop spending taxpayer money on housing youth in hurtful illegal conditions
124710 its fair to conclude that the defense is substantially out of compliance very very serious problems continue to exist at the states juvenile detention facilities
124711 when i got out i was like a baby my whole thought process had to be restructured
124712 with over a quarter of a million dollars per ward why cant you build new facilities
124713 if were spending that much money which is by any measure extraordinary why isnt it clearer in these hearings what the impediments were why hasnt there been more progress
124714 we take this stuff so seriously which is why we are trying to prosecute this guy to the full extent of the law
124715 when our officers got there one of them found him at the rear of the high school on foot no vehicle no dog no luggage
124716 he kind of looked blank there was no look of fear or concern
124717 i have a real one from italy and i knew there were no cane corso breeders in the nine county bay area
124718 i looked at his dogs and said those are neopolitans bred with pit bulls
124719 made me run my shoes through a little bucket of clorox he said he didnt want his dogs to get infected from human bacteria the whole place was full of feces
124720 he kept telling me he was breeding the macho dog that would be more powerful than pit bulls and be great for dog fights or guide dogs
124721 from the outset i thought it was a little strange because he asked me to bring him dog food out of my pocket
124722 he brought me to the back of his property and said oh yeah i have these two males cane corsos they were in an 8 foot by 8 foot kennel filled with feces and the dogs should have weighed 110 pounds they weighed 45 pounds and had no hair on their bodies you could see their spinal cords
124723 that said these statistics are still teaching us things and we need to constantly be looking at how we use force
124724 i am pleasantly surprised at the low number of times the officers used force
124725 we need to remember that the chief is doing this so he can see if there are areas to improve in
124726 he is doing that on his own initiative and i appreciate that
124727 this is the police department making its own best case and it is self serving and one sided as one would expect
124728 if i were chief of police in san jose and i heard my officers never used deadly force once it would be a headline

124784 i thank these guys all the time for that extra five weeks
124785 im not settling for the practice squad this year i told coach tom coughlin that i told receivers coach mike sullivan that
124786 i told em im trying to be one of their guys this year whether its special teams or at receiver
124787 he has great endurance that kid can go and go and go
124788 im a fierce competitor i probably consider myself one of the biggest competitors in the history of sports but at the same time im not a hater
124789 if domenik hixon is out there and he makes a play thats only going to make me better and i want to congratulate him on that im a team guy
124790 my frustration was we were trying to get through practice rather than practicing with a purpose
124791 thats not acceptable we have to be more efficient its going to be hot in miami and its hot now were going to be tired in miami were tired now
124792 these arent long practices compared to last summer come on its a joke compared to what we have done everyone has to uphold their end of the bargain when much is given much is expected and were not getting that
124793 im looking for efficiency in practice practicing with a purpose
124794 we dont have to be perfect just better than where we were the day before
124795 it wasnt even any kind of football setting where we would be talking about the season
124796 we saw each other at the dinner for his foundation about two weeks ago and the first thing he said to me was im ready to go im ready for the season
124797 ive been a leader already but this is just me putting more onus on myself to know every position on the defense and be a more vocal leader
124798 the most important thing to me right now is getting this team to win
124799 thats clich but its something that i really want to do i signed the extension to stay here not just to get the money but i want to help this team win
124800 this team had faith in me to come get me in the fourth round my rookie year while a lot of other teams passed me up
124801 so i want the dividends to show i want my aggressiveness and my play to funnel down to the young guys and help this team win
124802 the way he reads the quarterback and somehow knows where the balls going to be before its even thrown its amazing watching him
124803 there are some safeties in this league that can only cover and some other safeties who can only tackle or play in the box
124804 i want to be known as one of those all around guys that can do it all
124805 hes got a lot of ability excellent ball skills is a good blitzer and hes got a lot of things on the physical side hes becoming more and more of a pro each day thats really the highest compliment you can pay a player
124806 hazel wants to stay within sports and explore other opportunities
124807 well move everybody into nfl coverage and really tee them up for whats happening in the nfl that day
124808 if theyre visiting camp i dont know whether they would be a story they might be a shot
124809 im not smart enough to try to dissect whether im happy or sad
124810 this game will break your heart when you think you can get ahead of it and figure it out that way
124811 because you start to think oh ive got the guy on this one then you throw that pitch again and bam its gone
124812 deep thick and rosy adventure game by doki majo blog

124814 is a sequel to dokidoki majo shinpan which became popular before for majo witch check mode in this second version you can check witches who were in the first version as well as its sub heroines the system is called doki doki checker on top of that you are able to communicate with characters by voice and a touch it is upgraded from the first version
124815 touch as you want really if i do i will be blamed not little bit dont be arrested
124816 the game is becoming the one that i dont want people to see me playing im praising
124817 the level of being prudent is little lower than the former work wonderful what characters say on the top screen are getting closer than its former work like walking on a cliff no wonder it increases the cero
124818 if you wanna see panties feel free to do so
124819 theres a real progression during camp and theres so many guys youre giving guys opportunities to make a case for themselves
124820 where i get frustrated is when today it was more trying to get through practice than practicing with a purpose and thats not acceptable
124821 its going to be hot in miami its hot now
124822 were going to be tired in that game were tired now we have to be able to deal with those things and still get done what we have to get done

124824 in quanto abitanti della zona e confinanti con la suddetta nuova urbanizzazione
124825 it would have been nice to be at home and been a little bit more settled but going to boston for a day and coming here to new york is definitely exciting
124826 this is really just trying to bring depth to an area that is important as the season goes on because our pitchers these guys have been pitching incredible baseball and we are going to have some lulls
124827 they really havent had any major lulls but its going to be there so if you want that continuity you need that offense to take a little pressure off your pitchers thats something we need and thats why mark really became a great fit for us
124828 i view this as me trying to help this team win a world series
124829 we are not going to look ahead but at the same time they wouldnt have traded for me if that wasnt the goal
124830 hes got a great combination of strength and physical size
124831 he moves pretty well its a battle every time you go out there and see him across from you
124832 i am not a receiver i am not built to be a quarterback i take pride in doing the dirty work that is it i always have but being nose is just that i feel like it is one of the most important positions you have on the defense
124833 whats nice is even when his hands are not inside and he doesnt have the proper leverage theres a lot of other things that he can rely on to not get moved
124834 its olive oil but they infuse it with truffles so its heart healthy
124835 i mean to be honest it is i was in carolina and now i am here and its different and i am excited
124836 you dont make too much of one game you move on and you do what you can tomorrow
124837 they are a terrific club they beat us about the same number of times weve beaten them
124838 im very excited and i think theyre going to help us a lot
124839 start with xavier nady i think hes starting to swing the bat like we envisioned were excited about him were excited about marte he is not a comfortable at bat for lefthanders and he can get righthanders out too and then weve gotten pudge rodriguez whos been one of the best catchers in baseball for a long time
124840 great team they always have a great team every major league team in the american league has tremendous respect for the yankees they have a great lineup from the first all the way to the ninth and they always have good pitching its awesome to be with all these guys pitchers like mussina pettitte a rod jeter being in the same clubhouse with them is a thrill for me
124841 on balance we have a chance to upgrade in terms of offense
124842 were going with what we have and obviously whats coming in the system
124843 ian kennedys last three starts have been terrific and obviously carl pavano is starting his rehab process and alfredo aceves has been doing well
124844 hes pushing himself obviously in the mix theres no doubt about it
124845 they told me im going to play three or four days a week and theyre going to play brandon inge more
124846 i have all of my family coming to town of course i want to be in the lineup
124847 theyre a running team and ive known that for years
124848 they were running early they got good jumps basically it was hard for me to throw them out
124849 girardi knows im going to continue working and do the best i can to help rodriguez and help the yankees win
124850 is were four games back and in third place staring up at boston and tampa bay
124851 our long island fans are among our most passionate fans and we want to do everything we can to preserve that passion and be good stewards of the team
124852 i think its a symbolic thing to have a practice game open to the public each and every summer
124853 we want to maintain that tradition where fans can bring their kids and watch their team up close and personal
124854 i think the passionate fans we have on long island will realize that where we were in our current facility at hofstra was not state of the art
124855 and where were moving now is and will pay huge dividends on the field which is at the end of the day what the passionate fans really want
124856 i spend a lot of money each and every year relative to other nfl owners and i always have high expectations
124857 i had high expectations last year weve added a good amount of talent and i hope it pays off on the field
124858 coming from a background in business youre always concerned when you want to sell something of value and want to make sure the people who are buying it perceive it as valuable
124859 until you go out on the market and test something youre not sure how its going to work

124861 i was born in kent and ran away from home to work in a holiday camp in bembridge i decided to come back to the island to expand the business
124862 we already sell liquid silk all over the world and are looking at establishing ourselves in china
124863 this is a partnership between a community group trying to make a difference and the
124864 the outcome of the county press bags recycling project will be valuable extra funds being raised by not for profit groups on the island
124865 the scheme is in keeping with eco island and is an excellent fundraiser for island groups

124885 what they found lacking was the depth of understanding and vision in dealing with complex international and security issues articulation to comprehend and project pakistani policies in a clear and candid way more so on public places than in closed door meetings they did not find the will and the capacity in the prime minister to grasp the importance of issues take control of matters and make decisions which he could sustain
124886 the one issue which damaged gilanis credibility as a potentially serious leader and policy maker was the brutally botched up isi fiasco whoever did this to gilani actually torpedoed his us visit which turned into a non starter the moment the isi notification was withdrawn it was beyond gilani to stand by his order for more than a few hours and washingtonians got the message that they were dealing with a non entity and should not take him seriously
124887 but the moment the script was over and he had to answer questions the level of discourse and understanding came crashing down to earth the contrast was so stark and embarrassing it discounted both the images gilani presented and made him look like artificial and someone who was being remote controlled
124888 washington was not ready for such a visit and whoever forced it on gilani did a great disservice to the man to the party he represents and to pakistans infant democracy at a time of great internal political administrative security economic and social turmoil packing him off to washington as a showpiece so early in office could at best be described as a deep conspiracy of sorts his insincere advisers more interested in their own self projection pushed him to fly across the atlantic for performing the impossible task of exposing himself to the most sophisticated important and hawk eyed audience of decision makers to be found anywhere in the world

124909 he will bring the level of the team up a notch keane has a proven record and great mobility and versatility he can play on the wing or a bit behind the striker
124910 it is very good for the team to have a player who can get in between the oppositions midfield and defence and score goals
124911 the tactical lay out of the team and whether or not we are going to play two up front is down to rafa benitez
124912 when he signed keane im sure he had a very clear idea of where he wanted to play him
124913 and you will see the check mark added to it
124914 of course i welcome the signing we just needed a few small details a few new players in order to make a big difference to our season

125061 after a fall in output in q2 the manufacturing sector clearly appears to be tumbling into recession and if the services balance fails to pick up in next tuesdays report the surveys will still be suggesting that the
125062 meanwhile the manufacturing output prices balance reached a new record high but still suggests that core output price inflation should ease a bit in the next few months
125063 were the headline index to remain at its current level through the current quarter then it would have been weaker on only one occasion since the series began in 1992 q4 1998 this would be consistent with heavily negative growth in manufacturing output possibly as low as 3 yoy
125064 the bank of england is in no position to respond given elevated inflation pressures indeed both input and output prices hit new series highs consequently the bank of england looks almost certain to leave interest rates unchanged next week however we continue to believe there will be scope for rate cuts in early 2009 as inflation fears fade in response to lower commodity prices and weak activity constrains corporate pricing power
125065 yet more really horrible news on the economy and contraction in the third quarter is looking ever more probable the manufacturing sector started off the third quarter very much on the back foot
125066 yet again we have some bad news on manufacturing which is especially disappointing as exports orders seem to be crumbling despite the fall in sterling over the past year
125067 recession here we come having fallen sharply in june the two cips surveys were consistent with zero gdp growth the manufacturing survey has continued to fall in july down by a further 1 6 points despite a chunky near 4 point fall the prior month
125068 assuming the services sector survey moves sideways we actually expect it to fall the fall in the manufacturing cips means the composite cips is now consistent with negative gdp growth
125069 its really helps quite the nervous system and gives new messages to the body to the cells about how to work
125070 a variety of research surveys show that about 30 50 percent of our patients are using these therapies and when you look at the medical literature there is really very little information if any on any of these therapies

125076 i would hate to see virginia lose gov kaine but giving him up for bigger and better things i think would be good for our region
125077 he is a friend of southwest virginia it would be good for the number two man to know about the bluestone weve done the bluestone presentation before him
125078 now we are reading in the press thats hes among the top three
125079 perhaps they are looking at new people who can do things in new ways gov kaine is a good communicator with everyday people he was among the first to endorse obama
125080 if his father would have seen his headstone was missing or if any of us would have known you better believe that one of us would have contacted the sheriff and we would have been looking for it
125081 we originally planned to drive down to charleston and pick it up but fuel prices got so high that we decided to postpone our trip
125082 when i told the people we were working with in charleston that we were going to wait a while they said they would send it to us
125083 i was working with a fellow named bryant down there we offered to reimburse them for their trouble but he said no they sent it up here to us by fed ex
125084 we just had to wait until they had staff available to do it properly
125085 if you want to blame someone for the timing blame ken
125086 all the farmers around here and the families that raise gardens need the rain
125087 i think our uncle would have appreciated what was done for him here today
125088 metal manufacturing and processing is a mining equipment company that was created to meet the growing demand for mineral extraction
125089 mmps location in tazewell county will be close to its customer base and will aid the mining industry in southwest virginia more than 170 new jobs will be created and i am confident the company will find a skilled workforce in the area to meet its needs
125090 seventy five to 80 percent of what we see in terms of economic development in virginia is through expansion of existing businesses that are finding virginia to be a good place to work
125091 we are the only ones to win the top spot so far
125092 we had other options kentucky and west virginia but right here is why we chose virginia they are excited about new jobs
125093 we are excited about the creation of 171 skilled jobs in a five year period
125094 that is huge for our area with the economy as it is
125095 patrick has already told you of the forbes announcement of virginia being the best for business but i want to tell you something that forbes doesnt know
125096 rural virginia which is where we are standing has some of the hardest working and most patriotic and god fearing people you will find
125097 while we have been very successful over the past few years with the recruitment of high tech information technology based jobs in our region i have consistently stated that we must also continue to work hard to create and attract new jobs in the manufacturing areas
125098 that is one reason i am excited about this metal manufacturing company because it offers new manufacturing based jobs and there is still a great demand in our region for these jobs we must continue to focus on helping our existing industries and attracting new manufacturing jobs in our area along with our strong efforts to diversify and attract high tech information technology based jobs
125099 to resolve the divergences in a spirit of dialogue and compromise while respecting the state and fundamental liberties
125100 the european union will continue to observe the situation in turkey taking into account the democratic functioning of institutions
125101 despite everything this is a good day for turkey and for europe
125102 there is a vast majority among the turkish people who are in favor of european values im sure this played a role as stated by the president of the turkish constitutional court
125103 now it is time to get back to normal and re energize the reforms with a broad consensus and based on dialogue with all sections of turkish society
125104 of course we have to read it now in more detail but it is positive turkey is living a tense situation and we very much hope that the decision by the court will contribute to restore political stability
125105 closing down the akp on the basis of this indictment clearly goes against european rules on closing down political parties and would have been an anti democratic decision
125106 hopefully the akp will draw the right conclusions from the court ruling and will take action now
125107 todays decision is a cause for celebration for turkeys friends the fact the court chose not to close the akp means turkey can follow a more democratic and european path
125108 this case has been a distraction from the political economic and constitutional reforms that turkey needs to modernize for eu membership the priority now should be to focus on these reforms
125109 now it is important that all decision makers make a contribution to reconciliation and political stability and stick to the path of reform
125110 for turkey to get closer to the eu it is now of the greatest importance that turkey further strengthens its democratic institutions in the framework of constitutional reform
125111 astoria which hosts 18 000 visitors on sundays witnessed 25 000 people this sunday our restaurants and cafes reported increases between 25 and 30 percent in turnover
125112 what kind of a space would you create if you could design a mysterious space to your very own special hero
125113 i really had no idea what to expect when the cupboard door was finally opened
125114 im genuinely delighted that part of torosays 150 year old history has turned out to be so important and the bottle is now on display in its rightful home
125115 it was amazing to find this bottle and its really an extraordinary story all in all
125116 it is such an important part of the history of veuve clicquot we are very grateful to chris james for letting us have the oldest bottle with our famous yellow label
125117 the bottle is literally priceless it is a one off and therefore unique
125118 yeah im full i feel like im going to burst
125119 it depends on the dish but ive never gotten a complaint that its too little
125120 weve looked at large portion sizes almost entirely in terms of whether its healthy for us and now we have to consider is that sort of a demand going to be sustainable
125121 it would probably be a way to take pressure off of grain markets if we somehow convinced people to take smaller portion sizes
125122 stuffed and starved the hidden battle for the world food system
125123 but its unusual to see it in the united states where ive seen reports of low income american families doing what low income families in the third world do which is skipping meals particularly women skipping meals so their kids can eat
125124 theres certainly a sort of downshift in the quality and sometimes for the poorest americans the quantity of food theyre able to afford
125125 the typical adult eats at a restaurant nearly six times a week and more than half say eating out is an essential part of their lifestyle
125126 ive seen some anecdotal reports in the press about restaurants saying theyre making the portions a little bit smaller in order to save money but i havent seen that as a general trend in going into restaurants
125127 so if you pay a dollar for an order of french fries only about 20 cents goes for the potatoes the oil and the salt
125128 when a restaurant sells a large fry instead of a small fry the cost of the potatoes themselves adds only a little bit of cost and all their other costs of doing business stay the same so companies make a lot more profit off of big portion sizes
125129 yes portion sizes are large in the u s but people who tend not to have choice about portion sizes are people who are on lower incomes who buy prepackaged food which comes in those fixed portion sizes
125130 blaming the consumer for what is available on the market isnt a satisfactory explanation for why theres a food crisis
125131 potentially and this is up for debate a benefit of higher prices is lower consumption and in this country that actually would not be a bad thing overall
125132 he owes us a visit deniz baykal did not to come visit us in our new premises
125133 our doors are always open to akp and all other parties
125134 it was the chp who last went to meet with pm
125135 its not important akps reconciliation with the chp they should better compromise with the constitution
125136 we would encourage turkey to use this moment to reinvigorate its efforts with the eu
125137 i know that requires both sides the eu to reinvigorate its efforts as well to move forward on the basis of turkey continuing its efforts at political and economic reform based on turkeys constitution and secular democracy
125138 we have confidence in turkey and confidence in the turkish people and their democracy the court has rendered an opinion
125139 were going to continue to work with this government weve worked quite well with them
125140 if you avoid expensive neighborhoods like this one youll do alright but the key is to plan ahead
125141 i want to believe that hereafter necessary efforts will be exerted to defuse the tension in turkeys political life
125142 of course the chief prosecutor will continue to follow this party if he feels the necessity of filing another lawsuit he will sure do it in this case just like we did it now were going to come up with a decision
125143 its a serious warning to this party i hope the party in question will get the message it should get
125144 putting some very important issues in front of the constitutional court resulted in important economic and social consequences
125145 we once again want to call on our political actors
125146 the political battle should be done in the field of politics
125147 the court has designated it a political party that has become a focal point against constitutional principles the akps place in the turkish political system will be seriously questioned
125148 no one can act like nothing happened from now on
125149 the court did not solve the crisis but designated it it is the akps responsibility to pull the country out of this crisis only a radical transformation of the akp can bring the crisis within a democratic process
125150 the court hopes the problem can be overcome with political decisions
125151 non closure decision gave us a chance to beat that party with politics we do not intend to give up on the secular modern republic
125152 the court passed a serious test of democracy most important is the statement of the court president
125153 sent a message to parliament and political parties to end party closures
125154 how can i comment on a decision of the top court as a soldier
125155 the turkish militarys stance on secularism remains in place it was not different with the commander before me it is not different with me and it will remain the same with the next one
125156 all our institutions are fulfilling their functions inscribed in the constitution these remarks are valid also for latest months political and judicial debates
125157 reaching final success in the struggle against terrorism pursuing economic and political reforms concluding the accession negotiation process with the european union and seeing our peaceful efforts bear fruit in the international stage can be cited among these priorities
125158 i believe focusing on these matters will contribute massively for turkey to preserve its stability in the long term
125159 the talks will start but of course one should be careful i individually have some worries
125160 first of all the turkish cypriots should be careful peace can be achieved but it may not be fair or long lasting the turkish cypriots should not give up on these two concepts
125161 i cannot give an answer to them the turkish cypriots will do but they should ask this question as well do the greek cypriots want to live together
125162 he got angry and very upset about my visit i was very happy due to his disappointment the greek chief of staff is also going to the island am i going there for an intervention
125163 the working schedule of the top court on the case has never been determined by pressure from outside
125164 we couldnt ignore the fact that the case should be finalized as soon as possible considering its social economic and political significance we are too living in this country
125165 the party has become a focus of anti secular activities
125166 turkeys governing party avoids being shut down for anti secularism
125167 turkey staved off a full blown political crisis and a descent into prolonged uncertainty yesterday wednesday after the governing party narrowly escaped being wound up for allegedly plotting an islamic state
125168 paved the way for a possible truce between turkeys warring secular and pro islamic factions it also represented a reprieve for prime minister recep tayyip erdogan
125169 the courts decision ends months of uncertainty and opens the way for turkey to pursue its international interests once more
125170 a vote to close a party with nearly 50 percent support in elections last year would have also harmed turkeys eu membership aspirations
125171 a narrow victory and frustrated turks intent on protecting the secular character of the government
125172 maybe ankara now can get back to the important work of building a liberal muslim democracy
125173 secularism is enshrined in turkish law and the akp would be wise to heed the warning of court president ha im k l who said yesterday that the ruling was a serious warning to the party
125174 with this conviction the judges have chosen to not destabilize the functioning of institutions and prevented turkey from falling into a deep political crisis
125175 according to many observers this process constitutes a recall to secularism
125176 in fact the judges would not dare give a decision which would damage turkeys image in the world this is not the last struggle between the kemalists and islamist conservatives
125177 crisis and common sense erdo ans errors are forgiven turks chose not to leave the islamist party outside the scope of the law
125178 the decision shows that turkey is resolutely anchored to rights and it is a country that respects the political pluralism and the constitution
125179 turkey saved the prime ministers party islamist erdo an gets only financial cut the eu is relieved
125180 the verdict may lead to a crisis in an atmosphere of bombs and confusion the verdict will restart the modernization process that leads turkey to european union
125181 continue to protect the fundamental principles of our republic also in the future
125182 the victory of erdo an and akp despite the prosecutors investigation
125183 would help to find ways of solving the existing problems
125184 one of the key factors that might in the end decide the outcome of the whole process is ankara and the situation in turkey
125185 we requested iran with its positive relations with the non aligned movement and the organization of the islamic conference not to withhold its assistance on the cyprus matter
125186 an urgent need to establish an effective balance between the requirements for improving aviation safety and the requirements at national and international level for the administration of justice
125187 to support and adopt for inclusion in annex 13 the description of a just culture
125188 a culture in which frontline operators or others are not punished for actions omissions or decisions taken by them that are commensurate with their experience and training but where gross negligence wilful violations and destructive acts are not tolerated
125189 will greatly facilitate the reporting and sharing of safety data as an essential contribution to enhancing safety in international aviation
125190 whatever happens to haydarpa a in the future we put our note to history
125191 however shall we sit at home because the laws are rapidly changing no we should create public opinion
125192 the akp which has never been a focal point of anti secular activities will continue to defend the basic principles of the republic
125193 from now on everybody and especially we the politicians have the responsibility not to drag turkey into such a situation again
125194 now it is time to get back to normal and re energize the reforms with a broad consensus and based on dialogue with all sections of turkish society
125195 closing down the akp on the basis of this indictment clearly goes against european rules on closing down political parties and would have been an anti democratic decision
125196 turkey is living a tense situation and we very much hope that the decision by the court will contribute to restore political stability
125197 todays decision is a cause for celebration for turkeys friends the fact the court chose not to close the akp means turkey can follow a more democratic and european path
125198 this time emerging economies want to rebalance the rules particulary regarding agricultural subsidies which they see and i think correctly as inherited from a past in which it was the former colonial powers who led the dance and not them
125199 but the collective feeling is that we cant stay where we are
125200 we plan to invest 700 million to 800 million for the construction of 50 hotels within 10 years we will open two hotels in gaziantep and two hotels in kayseri in the first quarter of 2009
125201 meanwhile we will also lay the foundations of istanbul beylikd z bis hotel bursa bis hotel and zmit bis hotel projects in 2008
125202 we will lay the foundations of hotels in four different cities of russia in 2008 additionally we will carry out 1 billion hotel investments in 10 cities of the country
125203 our negotiations with accor for new projects in georgia azerbaijan and ukraine also continue
125204 we have been extremely particular about going over the details of the project and that is why it has taken 18 months to determine the basic features of the loan and grant the loan to akfen reit
125205 we have been working hard for 18 months in order to obtain this credit we have completed a couple of our projects during this period but we have not managed to obtain the loan until now
125206 there is no money in the markets at the moment besides the loan opportunities in the foreign markets have downsized
125207 international banks do not show much of an interest in turkey and this situation fundamentally emanates from the international conjuncture rather than turkeys internal problems
125208 we also came upon findings dating back to the hellenistic period in the third century b c besides the ancient graves pertaining to the roman and byzantium times
125209 the discoveries tell us that the antalya district had been used as a residential site well before the time of attalos the pergamon king who was regarded as the founder of the city
125210 it is highly important for us to protect our historical artifacts and to pass them onto future generations upon the completion of this excavation which i respect a lot antalya will gain a new hotspot this will highly contribute to the international reputation of the city as well as to the growth of other sectors
125211 we will have the opportunity to exhibit the ancient graves of thousands of years to domestic and international tourists by turning the excavation site into an open excursion area
125212 we undertook the academic consultancy of the do u garaj excavations as the sole university in the city we worked with a team of 30 people and four professors and found 38 ancient graves on the site
125213 according to our agreement with the antalya city museum we would conduct the excavations for one and a half months which would be followed by a break for one month
125214 the museum wanted to go on with the excavations despite our absence which was of course unacceptable for us we could not undertake the academic consultancy of a project which we were not involved in
125215 antalya city museum created the conditions that forced us to abandon the project
125216 the museum told us that the works are progressing slowly since the excavation is too scientific i see antalya as a rather unlucky city for having such an understanding by one of its most important foundations
125217 with the permission of the culture and tourism ministry we started the excavation works on may 12 2008 with the aim of protecting our cultural heritage as well as preventing any attempts to steal the historical artifacts
125218 akdeniz university assigned their team to other excavation work in ka patara district and kumlucas rhadiopolis district between july 12 and september however the permission for the do u garaj excavations has been given up to the end of 2008 by the ministry in other words we need to go on with the works with or without them in order to get the best output within the shortest possible time
125219 the works are going on with great care and the antalya metropolitan municipality is supporting us in this project with some technical aids
125220 its a tale of two sectors that are really driving things
125221 because of high oil prices a weak housing market and a weak job market the consumer is under unprecedented stress
125222 a lot of it does come down to the auto companies
125223 we also expect an increase in the number of overnight stays in our hotels for 2008 this rise has taken place despite the increase in the prices the price of the standard rooms in our hotel in belek was approximately 550 during the high season of last year
125224 however this level escalated to 780 for this year meanwhile the prices of overnight stays in some of our villas which stood at 1 800 in 2007 have increased to 2 000 in 2008
125225 the prices of overnight stays in our villas located in premium belek and bodrum complexes vary between 2 800 and 20 000 these villas have reached full occupancy rates during the high season
125226 we have been booking these villas one year in advance
125227 these high tax rates contradict with the eu harmonization policies they also cause turkeys economic growth to slow down
125228 in the next two or three months its logical to expect that turkey will outperform other emerging markets
125229 the gradual resumption of the artistic work intensified the commitments
125230 weve lost the most prestigious the most beautiful regiment in france
125231 emotionally its a blow because they are part of the pride and identity of the town economically its a catastrophe
125232 when 1 700 people leave a town of this size its a disaster there are jobs that are going to be lost
125233 unless we get other personnel to compensate its a catastrophe for the town
125234 its been a relief for everybody because it would have been a disaster if the base had been shut
125235 we no longer face the menace of a ground invasion
125236 but we face new threats terrorism religious extremism collapsed states and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
125237 one official spoke of 350 permanent staff and 1 000 students then someone from the ministry talked of half that nothing compares to what weve lost its like taking away a ferrari and giving you a renault clio a clios not a bad car but its not a ferrari
125238 they are always in transit and dont have the same buying power what do we do if we lose our business theres no unemployment insurance for shopkeepers
125239 no matter how you look at it we are collateral damage
125240 quorum in presidential voting session in parliament is presence of at least 367 deputies
125241 there is no closure but we have issued the akp a very strong warning
125242 all in all the verdict is welcome news for the markets but it would be naive to believe that everything is fine and well now
125243 challenges to the turkish economy are larger today than any time since 2002 and political uncertainty is still elevated
125244 we expect prime minister recep tayyip erdo an to strengthen the imf and european union anchors a precautionary stand by agreement could be sealed with the imf within the next two months
125245 policymakers will presumably get back to what they should be focused on reducing the economys vulnerability to shocks such as what is now happening in the world economy
125246 i dont think the akp will have grown overly complacent about possibly irritating measures since the vote was so close furthermore theyve lost momentum on economic reform lately at an uncomfortable time in the global markets
125247 you dont have to read newspapers reading the constitutional courts decision from here could be enough
125248 all companies exporting quantities more voluminous than a ton a year to the european union market will be affected by the reach regulation there are currently 2 500 companies to whom this would apply our exporting companies should pre register all the products they export or plan to export to the eu until dec 1 the firms that are not pre registered may not be able to export past january
125249 however unless we act quickly we might not be able to reach such figures in the future
125250 while the eu market constitutes 37 percent of turkeys chemical sectors export portfolio we must figure out how we can turn the reach threat into an opportunity to improve the sectors standards
125251 we founded a brussels based representative office named reach global services through the istanbul mineral and metals exporters association imm b and it will start to operate as of september
125252 via the office which will also have branches in istanbul and helsinki we will be able to keep the pre registration cost which would be nearly 20 million euros at the lower level
125253 the offices will enable companies in the turkish chemical sector to keep the formulas of the products secure from foreigners by sending the information to a turkish origin european counterpart
125254 as a critically important fact in both continuing trade with europe and the eu acquis communautaire the reach regulations do not only concern the chemical sector
125255 from textiles to automotives packing industry to iron and steel every sector is subject to reach regulations directly or indirectly
125256 confined to single figures if the market begins to ease but are potentially more significant if the global outlook deteriorates
125257 he was well prepared for his possible arrest and thinks everything will end well
125258 in order to prove these serious crimes the prosecution will have to present a significant amount of evidence including the testimony of many witnesses
125259 we agreed in belgrade that he would ask for a 30 day delay and he will certainly do that
125260 this is a political man a former poet he likes being the centre of attention
125261 he will try to use the dock to tell how he was able to escape arrest for 13 years and make revelations about the role of the west
125262 tell him not to go down with the elevator what does he think he has become because his father is finance minister
125263 i congratulate you for remaining a clean person please dont ever step inside the casino
125264 come to your senses theres a damocles sword hanging over your head if you start doing the same things you can be sued again
125265 after the election of my successor i will step down to allow a government to be formed rapidly
125266 we are going to look forward to working with all responsible israeli leaders in the government whether it is this government or future governments
125267 any kind of political agreement has to be approved by the cabinet and usually by the parliament and he olmert has less ability to push that through than before
125268 who is going to make a deal with him when they know he cant deliver he is a lame duck
125269 this government has reached an end and it doesnt matter who heads kadima they are all partners in this governments total failure
125270 national responsibility requires a return to the people and new elections
125271 ey p bey believe me no matter what the decision is you will see that our democracy laicism and judicial system will come out of this period stronger
125272 ey p bey you will see how right i am
125273 we are expanding toward the west of the city with this hotel investment
125274 consequently the mediators are willing to continue their work in particular on the structure of inter institutional dialogue which should lead to deeper state reform
125275 the king appreciated their availability and asked them to draw up a report for him in the second half of september
125276 to examine in what way guarantees can be offered in order to begin in a credible way an institutional dialogue
125277 the basic factor for this unregistered economy is the tv implemented on unprocessed stones
125278 the basic stone trading in turkey is diamonds while the actual value of the unprocessed diamond that entered turkey in 2007 was worth 1 25 billion in official records it was 10 million its 20 percent tv was 2 million
125279 should tv be removed the sector will be on record providing collection of 134 million from value added tax income corporate and employment taxes
125280 it is not carried with trucks or ships women carry it even in their wombs therefore it is very difficult to control under these conditions tv loses its effectiveness
125281 that would mean drawing 15 000 world firms to istanbul
125282 under such conditions istanbul may become a strategic spot by attracting jews the leader of the worlds precious stone sector arabs who are not allowed to enter israeli market and former soviet countries which have close relations with turkey considering the location of the region significant developments may occur in the sector
125283 turkey is dependant on abroad in precious stone however it is superior to other countries in terms of craftsmanship
125284 we are determined to implement the regulations and to try to implement the regulations effectively
125285 in china privacy is respected and guaranteed in hotels and other public places there is no special arrangement that is beyond internationally generally used security measures
125286 its clear that i have been providing on behalf of the ioc incomplete information
125287 had i and the international media been informed earlier of this understanding that certain websites would be inaccessible we would not now find ourselves in the position where they as well as myself have been taken by surprise
125288 i think it is disappointing that someone comes in there and literally steals one of the most exciting moments of the games
125289 this is a great surprise and i have not heard of this happening before
125290 i would be lying if i tell you that i was not excited when i first stepped on the pitch but that was a sweet thrill
125291 our fans supported me and i want to pay them back by playing solid football
125292 it is obvious that we are very very much stronger than the opposition
125293 we had some problems when we had concentration issues but otherwise we were really effective and could have scored more
125294 we wanted to find the first goal early and we did that
125295 there was only one team on the pitch today and it was fenerbah e it was nice to see us finish with a clean sheet and our passing is getting faster every day
125296 we would like to call on all political actors if there are rules and constitutional changes that seem wrong to the public eye they should make necessary arrangements fast
125297 a closure decision was not made but a serious warning was made i hope that this decision will be evaluated and that necessary measures will be taken
125298 this is the path of modernization and serving the public as atat rk pointed out it is the path leading to full membership in the european union
125299 it has been decided not to close down the party because the number of members calling for closure did not reach seven as required by the constitution however the result of this decision is a serious warning to the party
125300 this is a serious crisis the constitutional court did not solve the crisis but determined it
125301 for a fraudulent substitution of urine which is both a prohibited method and also a form of tampering with the doping control process
125302 these rule violations were established following the deliberate storage of samples by the iaaf and reanalysis using comparative dna techniques and were the result of a specific investigation which was instigated and carried out by the iaaf for more than a year
125303 i am very impressed by the energy and organization of the local residents who are opposing the uranta factory i really believe that they have a chance but ultimately they have to convince the government and the state
125304 europe does not want the environmental pollution of cement factories and it seems that turkey is prepared to take over production despite the consequences the population has to learn and quickly about its collective power for change and this means that individuals must understand that the group is more than the sum of its parts
125305 this is a new and challenging idea for many turkish activists who often like to work alone feeling eclipsed by the group they fail to appreciate that everyones important and become so involved in their personal agenda that they lose sight of the reality
125306 the problem of turkish ego is a subject that needs to be recognized and openly discussed
125307 i am unusual amongst architects as most of us want to leave our mark on the landscape as large and as often as possible but to be honest i like my contributions to be sympathetic to the land around us to blend in with the surroundings as my design for the konak baba da annex to the l deniz resort hotel shows you cant see it until youre virtually on top of it
125308 as far as the small but important areas of wetland left in fethiye is concerned i will do my best to ensure that it remains unspoiled and by that i mean that no building is allowed there the state hospital and the justice department have already encroached on this land weve lost so much of our natural landscape there is hardly any natural green space left in fethiye but its better late than never
125309 i would like to see the group develop to involve more of fethiyes residents
125310 but for me its like the story of the man who sees thousands of starfish stranded on the beach
125311 from this simple story we can understand that whatever we do no matter how small it is important and it all makes a difference
125312 we arrived in istanbul two weeks ago and in zmir last week
125313 our aim is to make people familiar with native american music we will now travel to bodrum and probably to israel from there
125314 we want to launch our carpets on the market our goal is to provide economic support for the women who weave the carpets and attract attention to the cultural and artistic settings in meandros
125315 zeer opvallend is echter de stijging van medische interventies in de balkan landen met bijna 45 procent verklaring daarvoor is dat veel meer belgen naar die landen zijn gereisd wegens een goedkoper verblijf en goedkopere brandstof dan in de andere europese landen

125322 those are for married men one for january one for february one for march
125323 dad i found out what you meant about gay sailors one night i was out on deck all alone when a man came by and put his hand on my shoulder so i threw him overboard
125324 well for 3 hours he swam behind the boat yelling
125325 stop stop youre not going to cut it off with that rusty damn saw are you
125326 nope im going to set this old shed on fire and go to town for a cold beer you do whatever you want friend feed

125334 organizations like the kenneth b schwartz center are an important tool in the fight against cancer as they help create better relationships between caregivers and patients by doing things like improving communication and helping caregivers be more emotionally present for their patients
125335 our mission is to support and enhance the patient caregiver relationship and much of our work takes place at cancer centers around the country so we are thrilled to be part of its survivor circle exhibit
125336 substance abuse varies significantly depending upon the purpose for which these are used for example 28 6 of those drinking alcohol do so to help them get to know a potential sexual partner while 26 2 of those using cocaine take it to make sexual intercourse last longer
125337 those who consume alcohol cannabis cocaine or ecstasy under the age of 16 are likely to have had sexual relations before this age too
125338 the current patterns of drug use among the study participants reflect their number of sexual partners with regular cocaine users in comparison with those who have never taken it being five times more likely to have had five or more sexual partners within the last 12 months or to have paid for sex
125339 prevention experts must be aware of how young people view the relationship between drug use and sexuality there are very few preventive programmes in our country that take this link into consideration
125340 now that we are aware of this link and the associated health risks new programmes and preventive strategies will be needed in addition to further research in the area of drug use and its social psychological and physical links to sexuality based on the real and important experiences of young people themselves
125341 giving comprehensible and appropriate information about survival benefit is extremely difficult in addition the reluctance to inform patients of the limited survival gain of palliative chemotherapy may be motivated by a desire to protect patients from bad news
125342 however the reluctance to address these difficulties and sensitivities may be hampering patients ability to make informed decisions about their future treatment
125343 our findings indicate that the initial hospital costs associated with penetrating trauma are substantial and vary to a considerable degree by patient injury and treatment characteristics
125344 although the costs of penetrating trauma resulting from shooting are higher than from stabbing the most commonly used weapon in violent crime in england and wales is actually a knife
125345 at an average cost of 7 699 per penetrating injury from alleged assault and a total of 417 injuries per year requiring hospitalisation for at least three days the total acute care cost of this type of injury alone may exceed 3 2 million annually
125346 public health initiatives that aim to reduce the incidence and severity of penetrating trauma are therefore likely to produce significant savings in acute trauma care costs
125347 considering the additional medical costs of rehabilitation and broader costs to society resulting from lost productivity permanent disability premature death and the pain and suffering of the victims and their families there is a compelling argument for money to be better spent on prevention strategies that reduce violent incidents
125348 it should be borne in mind that most of the cost of trauma especially stabbing is not to the health service but in billions per annum to the taxpayer through legal costs loss of productive tax paying years in those that die or are severely disabled and in long term care

125428 at around 1 50pm we received a call to dunclug park about an assault on two members of sinn fein
125429 police believe the incident was a reaction by a small number of people in the area to a multi agency approach to the removal of bonfire material

125432 your ability to recognise these four behavioural traits is the first step in influencing people to change their behaviour and whilst you cant change difficult people you can communicate with them in such a way as they change themselves
125433 they want jobs completed quickly when this goal is frustrated it distorts their perception they think people are wasting time going off on a tangent taking too long taking advantage of them doing other things and so on
125434 drivers then become more assertive they can quickly become argumentative controlling loud and abusive like a bulldozer they want to push their way through or over any obstacle thats the quickest most direct route to solving a problem if it creates another one no problem theyll solve that next they focus on getting the task done they are not interested in peoples feelings people are secondary to getting the job done
125435 thats what drives this style when this doesnt happen promoters feel isolated unloved and unwanted
125436 i dont know why i bother no one really cares
125437 when they dont get appreciated their behaviour becomes attention getting they become difficult to ignore
125438 when they feel that they are uncertain how others see them they will become quiet and say nothing they might become the yes person who agrees with everyone in order to please them or they become the maybe person because they want to avoid disapproval by avoiding decisions the avoidance strategy ensures that they dont hurt the feelings of the others and thereby avoid conflict
125439 analysers want to get it right they are task focused and this purpose influences their behaviour they avoid making hurried decisions they are risk averse and are detailed oriented
125440 when analysers fear that a task will be done wrong their behaviour becomes perfectionist
125441 fine lets do it your way but its not going to work
125442 the worst thing you can do when dealing with a conflict is become defensive or angry if you start feeling upset excuse yourself for a moment count to 10 and return when youre feeling objective again
125443 weve all done it someone says something we dont like and were instantly thinking about a rebuttal thats the wrong move most people have their ears open but they arent really listening
125444 we have a tendency to focus on things we disagree on which is counterproductive if you think about it theres always a lot more we agree about than we disagree about when you acknowledge commonality you instantly diffuse the situation

125517 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic the way they acted was extraordinary
125518 they were very brave they reacted swiftly calmly in exiting the bus and as a result nobody else was injured
125519 stop the bus somebodys getting stabbed everyone get the hell off
125520 they returned to the back of the bus to find that the person who was stabbing the person in the neck had now sawed off the head of the victim
125521 he cut the victims head off and then walked up to the door holding it and just looked at them crazy like and then dropped the head and walked back to the body and started cutting it some more
125522 we have word from people on the scene that when the killer was alone with the body that there may have been some small acts of cannibalism on the body
125523 this may have been planned to have this moment of rage

125535 see were at war with a villainous country called bad and my superiors have ordered me to drop some bombs at placetown in bad now there is a munitions factory at placetown but there is a children hospital there too some people tell me that i should drop the bombs to help with the war effort but some tell me that we should avoid killing innocents i am so confused i just do not know who to believe
125536 look given what you have said it is clear that you should appreciate that dropping the bombs is a necessary evil
125537 but you told me that dropping the bombs was a necessary evil
125538 we only said that believing you should drop the bombs is what you should believe you never asked us what you should do that is an entirely different matter

125542 we found the arguments put forward by google youtube against their staff undertaking any kind of proactive screening to be unconvincing
125543 major providers such as myspace have not been deterred from reviewing material posted on their sites
125544 each image and video that is uploaded to the myspace server
125545 we find it shocking that a take down time of 24 hours for removal of child abuse content should be an industry standard
125546 advanced wifi devices such as the iphone and ipod touch are making free and available wireless internet access a must have for the mobile consumer by opening up our network for this three month period we are giving consumers over 3 500 additional locations where they can access the content and services they want without having to either pay for that connection or watch advertisements
125547 we feel that our pan european network especially supports the business traveller who is continually roaming across networks and incurring additional fees for data usage
125548 that doesnt mean those two million all went to the iphone
125549 competition in enterprise smartphones is going to be between blackberry and windows mobile
125550 the iphone is certainly a factor in the quarters growth because it gets everybody thinking about their old phone and what they need whether they buy an iphone or not
125551 there is admittedly turmoil in the global economy but the mass markets fascination with getting the latest and greatest handset shows no sign of abating
125552 reception towards these devices has been warm and as we head into the holiday quarter demand for these and other devices will no doubt increase
125553 the speculation by everybody was that the quarter would be down and miserable for everybody including motorola

125560 tom ist viel leichter und so weniger verletzungsanf llig als schwere jungs
125561 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date
125562 i feel quite glad the deals fallen through in a way because theres been a huge concentration of electricity generation in the hands on one supplier over a quarter of the market in one supplier that would have been very bad
125563 i cant think of any short term implications over the next couple of years from this the market remains unchanged because no deal is happening
125564 but in the long run it is very serious the government does have to get on with creating the climate in which these new nuclear power stations are built
125565 it would have been very convenient because edf have the resources they have the access to the technology and british energy have the sites
125566 the timing suggests to me that there might still be life in it because clearly its about terms rather than about principles so maybe they can go back and bring it together
125567 we are disappointed by the failure to reach an agreement overnight i think it would have been a good fit
125568 edf are as people know the worlds largest nuclear operator i think it would have been a very sensible way to take forward new nuclear plans in the uk
125569 but the future of new nuclear in the uk doesnt depend on this particular deal
125570 its up to the board now and edf to see if there is any way that this gap can be bridged but i think we are absolutely committed to new nuclear power and if this deal is not able to go through for whatever reason we will be looking at plans to make sure we can continue with our foot on the floor because britain needs these new nuclear power stations
125571 so its disappointing but its certainly something that we need to focus on as we make sure that britain develops the new nuclear power plants that it needs
125572 i hope that they can i do remain convinced this is the right deal but its got to be acceptable to the shareholders and those are the discussions that are going on today

125582 have been sleep deprived for perhaps very long periods of time they are struggling to sleep if this is happening night after night week after week on top of all our other schedules this is a dangerous recipe
125583 when you stop breathing in your sleep you dont know it it doesnt typically wake you up
125584 our findings along with those from the wisconsin cohort remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
125585 it is likely that our findings may underestimate the mortality risk of sdb in other ethnic groups or the lowest socio economic strata where there is poor awareness and access to health care

125588 we can win the next election weve got to do that in two ways set out a very clear vision about how our values are right for the country and how we can take the country forward and set out the weaknesses in the conservative case
125589 for heavens sake lets get serious of course we can win with gordon as our leader
125590 we have got to stop sounding miserable about ourselves and sounding as if we have been treated unfairly we havent been treated unfairly
125591 we are not doing well enough its what the voters have said to us we have got to focus on how we can do better
125592 i think we are going through tough times i always feel that tough times do not last long but that tough people do i think gordon brown is a tough man

125596 so before i start i wanted to let you all know that i tend to be really informal when i present and it usually leads to me blabbering and cussing a lot
125597 i was drinking one night and started thinking how cool to let people post pics and rate them from a scale of 1 to 10 it just seemed like a natural fit for me
125598 we basically came up with a price that two beers would cost someone in the midwest and thats what we charged for user subscriptions it just seemed appropriate to do it that way
125599 we started out in paris where jon brion collaborator inspired us to create first and think later
125600 we took the night train to berlin where everything came together in an avalanche of experimentation that took us all by surprise where we made a pact with producer stuart price to ignore the rules of good taste where we were hypnotised by marlene dietrich and spent many a long night throwing ideas around in the crumbling cabaret esque glamour of our favourite bar

125608 i dont understand why these people think i would just dump the cat
125609 i love the cat powder was never a stray these animals are like my children
125610 i never had the money to pay for a test to find out for sure
125611 making the olympics is definitely the best feeling ive ever had
125612 ive been working very hard for this for a very long time its been a lot of pressure but now i just want to enjoy it
125613 this is definitely not a sport people talk about every day
125614 they told us we couldnt take pictures there in rockefeller center we said there were a lot of other people taking pictures but they told us we couldnt
125615 they wouldnt give us a reason for why we couldnt be there but were pretty sure its because of how we were dressed
125616 rockefeller center is visited and loved each year by millions of people of all cultures and backgrounds
125617 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
125618 theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
125619 weve thrown people under the bus its the quickest way of getting fired from this campaign
125620 what we are talking about here is substance and not style
125621 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
125622 weve been hearing so much talk about the proliferation of national chains in new york and how mom and pop stores have been pushed out of the city but it struck me that there was so little data
125623 anybody who lives or works in manhattan runs into about five starbucks between your home and your office
125624 dunkin donuts having roughly 100 more stores in the city wasnt something i expected
125625 in some locations large parts of manhattan for instance it may be necessary to develop some innovative solutions to limit the number of chain stores and preserve unique new york city resources
125626 as much as we can guarantee anything we guarantee that this will be cleared up by tonight
125627 with all due respect to you personally i will defend myself before this institution as i would defend myself before any natural catastrophe
125628 i have not found one bone of my children yet and there he is alive
125629 clark although many things have changed you will always be reighs father and i will always be reighs mother
125630 we both love her dearly and have only her best interests and well being in our hearts i ask you now please please bring snooks back there has to be a better way for us to solve our differences than this way
125631 reigh honey i love you and miss you so much remember youre always a princess
125632 i have to accept that i appear to be the fall guy
125633 im thinking it was stop and go as she fell down
125634 were still investigating whether it was intentional or not but we dont believe so
125635 dubai is an eye opener in terms of what success one can achieve in a short span of time if you have the vision the will and the passion to succeed of course having a whole lot of money to do it also helps

125640 we plan to launch the start stop option of the scorpio hybrid before the end of this year since it is fuel efficient without adding on too much cost
125641 hybridisation offers many advantages primarily the benefits of fuel economy and reduction in emissions
125642 in this project we are proceeding on our own but for future projects we would like to make use of the strength of daihatsu
125643 i knew i could go all out because it was our last play in the series
125644 i think we know we have an opportunity to do something really really special to be a team to win back to back
125645 we also know what makes us good and its not hanging around and resting on our laurels we have guys who are self motivated
125646 we have definitely raised the bar with the way we played toward the end of the season last year
125647 winning the super bowl we set a higher standard for ourselves one play is not good enough we have to continue to strive for that excellence
125648 that helped us last year and it started before the season started with the team concept
125649 its easy to hand out t shirts and be superficial but i think this team took to those icons and allowed them to become our mentality and thats special
125650 we understand we are all driving toward the same goal
125651 you cant sit back and relax just winning the super bowl a lot of people are aiming for us and we have to prove ourselves again
125652 i dont see that ok we got what were looking for which is a goal sure because you get a chance to take care of your family but i dont see that
125653 what makes us good is the intensity and the effort thats what put us over the edge in our playoff run last season
125654 i dont think we have those types of guys who are resting on their laurels from last year
125655 i call them the a pullers this will be the very best the united states has to offer
125656 we have never sent our best team to the worlds because we all have to foot our own bill
125657 in my mind besides a foot race its probably the first sport
125658 we constantly try to get more money in the sport but the marketing side is difficult
125659 guys that are working with their hands and arms all the time theyre naturally good at it because of their job
125660 the everyday stuff helps if i have to carry a log somewhere ill carry it in an armwrestling grip
125661 hes a great kid and hes managed to take his skill and expertise to a new level nothing would surprise me hes a very accountable kid
125662 last year is last year im looking for bigger and better things this year im competing my butt off and im working hard each day and im looking for better things than last year
125663 this is the second year with matt schaub and obviously our chemistry is good on the field
125664 hes gotten back and hes really gotten stronger and hes 100 percent and andre johnson is 100 percent we got an awful lot weapons out there so well be even better
125665 he reminds me of a kid who played for me a long time ed mccaffrey
125666 he reminds me of him a great deal what happens to guys like that who people say is like this or like that they find a way to make up for it kevin in his career has become such a technician at what he does that if hes like a tenth of a second slower here or there speedwise hell find a way to make it up
125667 you have to let them know you believe in them
125668 and it just wasnt me it was our whole team everybody was feeling the type of player he was
125669 this has always been one of the tougher teams to play against in my career now to be on the other side of that and cause havoc for everybody else is definitely a positive for me
125670 they expect me to be quick and run their team thats what ive been able to do throughout my career
125671 at this point in my career the last couple of years ive been wanting to get with a winning organization
125672 on the screen with a camera right in your face its totally different
125673 but i can be more myself so that makes it easier
125674 theres hundreds of thousands of athletes who arent going pro who are just trying to get scholarships and coping with life on a daily basis
125675 and theres a lot of stuff in their environments that are holding them back
125676 its a very slim chance to make it and im still going to reach my goal
125677 i learned a lot from it but i dont think of it as a great career because my standards are real high
125678 it had to be very real and all the characters had to be believable and thats a difficult thing to find
125679 im sure i wouldnt have found that in los angeles and thats why i stayed in st louis to do it
125680 it got to the point where nothing was funny to me nothing was cool because id seen it a thousand plus times
125681 but youve got to trust your instincts at some point
125682 now if a studio wants to put up a bunch of money and change a little bit that would be all right
125683 to the beijing olympic games the biggest threat comes from the east turkistan terrorist organization
125684 i go against him every day in practice and i havent seen him take one rep off yet
125685 i heard coach make a comment one time last year that i probably would never be the player that i was
125686 i dont hold grudges but i store it in my mental bank and use it as motivation like i was always told when i was young one mans trash is another mans treasure so hopefully i can come up here and be a gem in buffalo
125687 he can really change whats going on at the line of scrimmage
125688 to have him up there we really have a lot of confidence in our defensive line and what they can do now
125689 if i can continue to stay healthy im definitely confident that i can make it back
125690 ive got a lot of good years left in me
125691 im definitely happy it feels good to be anywhere youre wanted
125692 its great being a person where people are counting on you
125693 i may be a big piece of the puzzle but im still a piece of the puzzle
125694 i think what were asking them to do fits what they can do
125695 i think were progressing as a unit remember that we started this process in march
125696 its nothing new right now were going into august so weve been doing this for months now
125697 im working at it im doing ok been working on it this whole offseason
125698 its a challenge that was given to me and im fine with it im a ballplayer they want me to do something ill work at it this is my craft this is what im supposed to do
125699 we thought when we drafted him that he would have the ability to play tackle
125700 thats why we drafted him there was no concern there that he had to be a guard he was going to be a tackle we put him out there and hes going to play left tackle for us
125701 hes going to go through some growing pains and thats part of it
125702 but the guy has very good feet is a very good athlete a smart guy very smart and picks up things he learns something every day
125703 last year i had the possibility to fight for the championship its ok but i knew that this year it was not possible anymore if i was racing for mclaren now in this moment maybe i am in the same position as i am now without the possibility to win
125704 at least i am happy to be with renault with the full support of the team with everyone working night and day to give me the best car
125705 after last year here there was nothing in my opinion there was nothing to discuss it was more a team decision than a team philosophy
125706 everyone makes his choices dennis was very clear his philosophy his way to run and to compete is like that as a professional im not like that we choose different ways
125707 the atmosphere in the team is fantastic and thats also due to heikki we love to work together
125708 were having a much smoother year its much more relaxed as it should be we dont have any excess baggage on our shoulders
125709 im in a bad mood i dont want to be in a good mood no signing hymns
125710 i go to church and i love to hear hymns
125711 if you dont fix this youre not going to be here
125712 i was kind of surprised to be honest with you
125713 and im very thankful for the opportunity and coach holmgren and his staff and the people in the front office for believing in me after going through what i went through last year
125714 hey its a tough business sometimes if he couldnt handle that little bit with me it gets a lot harder than that
125715 id been a school teacher for a long time now and so i kind of know how its going to work before i do something at least i think i do i try not to back a player into a corner unless i think im going to get the response i need
125716 just getting a feel for my surroundings and endurance was the biggest deal being able to last for a while
125717 really the only thing that prevents him from being very very successful on every play is leonard
125718 hes strong enough hes fast enough he has great skill he has become a very good blocker
125719 of course were all competing but ive never gotten sour

126044 mario hat nie mit einem verein an einem tisch gesessen
126045 bei gattuso wei ich es nicht genau aber ansonsten hatten wir immer das heft des handelns in der hand wenn wir flamini und hleb um jeden preis gewollt h tten w ren beide spieler jetzt bei uns aber wir waren nicht bereit finanziell ganz verr ckte sachen zu machen wenn wir einen star wie franck rib ry unbedingt wollen dann kriegen wir ihn
126046 dass der transfer von gomez nicht geklappt hat lag nicht an uns die stuttgarter wollten ihn partout nicht abgeben dabei sind 25 millionen euro plus x ja kein pappenstil

126057 given that bacterial vaginosis and hiv infection are both transmitted sexually it is difficult to determine whether associations found are causal or if there is some other reason why women with bv are more likely than others to become infected with hiv

126152 creemos que algunos pol ticos y algunos medios de comunicaci n son los responsables de ciertas actitudes racistas porque alimentan el morbo y el caldo de cultivo del rechazo a quienes piensan distinto o provienen de otros pa ses todos los d as escuchamos que la inmigraci n es el blanco de las denuncias y las cr ticas incluso relacion ndola con la inseguridad ciudadana

126368 identificar el vih fue el primer paso cr tico en definir la causa del sida pero como robert koch se al elegantemente hace m s de un siglo mostrando que un particular agente infeccioso causa una enfermedad espec fica puede ser un proceso arduo este proceso es especialmente complicado cuando la exposici n al agente se sigue por un periodo de incubaci n de meses o incluso a os antes de que los s ntomas aparezcan este es el caso del sida

126393 some people were puking some people were crying other people were in shock everybody was running screaming off the bus
126394 when we saw the head we knew he was dead
126395 i dont think the guy knew him at all i think he was really crazy the poor guy he didnt see it coming
126396 i felt bad that all the young people and old people had to see that

126412 i knew he was coming back from the exhibition my brother was supposed to go meet him at the bus depot and he never showed up and then my younger brother and my other brother went to go to his parents place to see if they know anything and they saw a bunch of news people there and then they asked at his parents and thats how we found out

126416 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
126417 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal
126418 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
126419 we can all feel safe that aliens are not abducting psychiatric patients and subjecting them to interesting examinations
126420 we respect the ruling to disallow legal representatives from outside parties like the national commissioner of police from becoming directly involved in the commission and cross examined the witnesses but this had the affect that one sided and distorted evidence were placed before the commission and that the national commissioner of police was not allowed an opportunity to provide important facts to the commission
126421 the national prosecuting authority under direction of adv pikoli even after his suspension conducted a well constructed media campaign managed to create public perceptions regarding the guilt of the national commissioner of police to the extent that it is doubtful whether it will be possible to have a fair criminal trial
126422 this attack was continued by the selective evidence by adv pikoli to the commission well knowing that his evidence under oath would be widely reported in the media and that the legal representatives of the national commissioner of police could not contest the evidence on his behalf
126423 the affect of this public attack on the national commissioner of police is that his constitutional right to fair legal process and his right to a presumption of innocence as corner stone of our criminal legal system were completely and irreparably damaged

126444 i chose to step down as assistant coach of new zealand maori in order to put full focus into the auckland team this year
126445 and now with the opportunities presenting themselves in the blues plus pats departure from the auckland head coach role i have certainly had some important decisions to make
126446 pat and i work well together so we are extremely fortunate the two coaching positions became available in the same season its a massive challenge and im looking forward to the opportunity
126447 shane has a played a major role in the success of auckland in the air new zealand cup
126448 he has the knowledge and an established relationship with pat and as a coaching team they have proven their ability to get results and we wish them well
126449 it is this time of year that rebel sport super 14 coaching vacancies must be filled and it is natural provincial coaches already aligned with a team will put their hand up
126450 but the applicants cannot be disadvantaged because of timing it must always be about the right person for the job
126451 we cannot make any firm decisions until we have interviewed the head coach candidates in early august
126452 once we have secured that role we will have a better idea of aucklands coaching personnel short and long term

126480 what up to all the ladies hanging out in mumbai
126481 i really dig how much music is infused with the movies
126482 lots of hip hop tracks sample indian music and a lot of their music sounds like it was influenced by hip hop
126483 ive never been able to come over there and do shows for you all but now im going to come and do shows
126484 i still contend that because of the nature of the snake there was no risk to the public
126485 if you read the literature it says the vipers bites are pretty benign
126486 but if you look at the experiences people have had in last decade some of those are pretty bad
126487 i wish we could take credit for the number of deaths
126488 the writers damian shannon and mark swift after we had done everything said did you notice how many kills there were and we said yeah there are a lot they said actually there are 13 so the writers had figured that out
126489 we also show what jasons doing when hes not killing
126490 hes just great on it and people didnt know that its fun to watch
126491 our character has been rejected hes pulled away from society he wants to live by himself and all of a sudden these kids come into his area and disrespect his area and he has nowhere to go hes like a caged animal with his back against the wall and he albeit in a bad way protects himself
126492 my knees got pretty damaged i had some bad knee problems afterwards and it took me about four weeks to really recover from it it definitely isnt as campy as the original friday the 13th movies they were what they were for their day but when you look at them now you dont get as creeped out its a different feel i think the audiences are demanding a little bit more of horror movies now so ours is a lot of blood and guts and weapons and stuff like that
126493 ive been doing the character background the victimization of jason since he was abused as a child he was always the outcast
126494 he was always shunned by society so ive taken the stance that its almost like a vietnam flashback where someone has been victimized and abused so badly that when things resurface and these kids start to encroach on his area he is once again having a flashback its a moment so intense that hes getting his revenge for when he saw his mother get murdered hes still in the moment like these people just recently murdered his mother and hes having his revenge
126495 we had to keep the hockey mask which is where it all started and camp crystal lake as a jumping off point for us to go back to the first one
126496 we wanted to make a movie that was fun and we havent done that before
126497 a lot of our movies i think have been more dreary and tended more towards what they call torture porn the scares are so scary but the scares are happening to kids that you love because you had a fun experience with them these are kids who are drinking smoking and having sex and its been a long time since youve seen that on the big screen were hoping that those two things coming together will give the audience a new experience with a horror movie

126500 there was understandable disappointment among harry potter fans when only one copy of the tales of beedle the bard was offered to the public last december
126501 i am therefore delighted to announce that thanks to the generous support of bloomsbury scholastic and amazon and with the blessing of all the wonderful people who own the other six original books the tales of beedle the bard will now be widely available to all harry potter fans
126502 notes by professor albus dumbledore which appear by generous permission of the hogwarts headmasters archive
126503 dumbledores commentary on the tales which was discovered among his papers after his death includes some historical notes personal reminiscences and insights into that most mysterious branch of magic wandlore

126517 i forget the exact terminology but the comment was made in terms of her activities now seem to be that shes calmed down and shes in a relationship thats quieted her down and as such she seems to be attracting less attention and theres less activity that the paparazzi all of you are focusing on

126546 bad personnel decisions have haunted the bush administration and one of the bigger disappointments is federal communications commission chairman kevin martin in his last months as master of the media universe he seems poised to expand government regulation of the internet
126547 it appears to reverse a decade old bipartisan policy against regulation of the internet
126548 t he internet has flourished because it has operated under the principle that engineers not politicians or bureaucrats should solve engineering problems

126567 today there is a realisation amongst saarc countries that it is only by cooperating within saarc that we will be able to strengthen ourselves individually and as a region and address the many common challenges that face us
126568 i am confident that the forthcoming summit will consolidate these gains and provide an impetus to the implementation of the many decisions that are in place
126569 the same way as waste vapour is drawn out of this material to make hikers more comfortable to less prone to hypothermia so it is able to breathe oxygen into our fuel cell and into contact with the conductive plastic
126570 the benefits for the motoring industry and for motorists are that the new design removes the need for platinum which acts as the catalyst and is currently central to the manufacturing process
126571 our reliance on platinum is making the likelihood of using fuel cells in everyday passenger cars increasingly improbable
126572 the cost of the platinum component alone of current fuel cells for a small car with a 100kw electric engine is more than the total cost of an 100kw gasoline engine also current annual world production of platinum is only sufficient for about 3 million 100kw vehicles less than one twentieth of the current annual global production of vehicles
126573 the small amounts of carbon monoxide that are always present in exhausts from petrol engines are a real problem for fuel cells because the platinum catalyst is slowly poisoned eventually destroying the cell
126574 the important point to stress is that the team has come up with an alternative fuel cell design that is more economical more easily sourced outlasts platinum cells and is just as effective
126575 there has been a proposal submitted and its a very interesting one

126581 we have about 40 000 genes in every cell and the main reason a brain cell is a brain cell is because only a small fraction of the genes are turned on the remaining genes that are not expressed are shut down by an epigenetic process called dna methylation
126582 interestingly the nature of this chemical modification is long term and hard to reverse and this fits with depression
126583 the whole idea that the genome is so malleable in the brain is surprising finding that epigenetic mechanisms continue to influence gene expression is pretty unusual
126584 these observations open an entirely new avenue of research and potential therapeutic interventions
126585 the fact you can mimic exercise is a big advantage

126946 if you dont get this i cant believe how stupid you are
126947 i think that bella actually might choose jacob even thought i want her so much to be with edward
126948 my theory is that bella is going to become a rage ing vampire and is become vicious and its up to edward and jacob to save her or kill her
126949 i just hope they get married and live happily ever after no need for conflict
126950 i have a feeling that she is going to end up with edward but is going to be a challenge i think once she becomes a vampire she is going to take over a very powerful gift that could be very horrible
126951 i think the volturi is coming after her i think heidi from new moon might have something to do with this there is no way heidi was in new moon for convience
126952 i think jacob will imprint another girl but not intentionally but does fall in love with her on the other hand i hope bella and edward will be together they all win
126953 im looking forward to the funny things emmett might say
126954 jacob is gonna crash the wedding i have a feeling like he might object ha that would be funny bella is going to worry over jacob and who knows it may be bella and jacob in the end because edward wants bella to be happy
126955 i think edward may have to give bella up for her own good and that he loves her enough that he will save her by giving her up
126956 i think bella is going to get some wicked powers if she becomes vampire
126957 i think edward wont be able to change her but who knows they are gonna marry anyway i hope
126958 its with great excitement that i wish to bring to your attention that tallat mohamed once a muslim now a born again christian living in tulsa oklahoma usa will be preaching the gospel of jesus christ and praying for the sick at the holy spirit revival in hallam victoria this friday 25th and saturday 26th july this man of god ministers in a mighty anointing of salvation deliverance and healing across the nations including muslim nations such as afghanistan in africa and the middle east when tallat was once a muslim he spent 8 years in the hospital due to epilepsy but was then healed delivered and set free by the power of god his life transforming message is jesus christ is healer deliverer and savior to all mankind
126959 tallat mohamed stayed with my family last night he is a world traveler he has now been to 98 countries and is on to the next one with his rather short stay he has taught me more than i could have even hoped for he used to be a photographer for models elle time newsweek and many other important and reputable sources then he felt called to the ministry and he just left he was making a hefty salary and he just left i know that is a fear for many of us we will be making the big bucks then we have to up and go to africa or something but he is still so blessed he taught on giving the tithe is your protection and giving is your provision he at one time had 5 cars yes 5 cars given to him because people felt led to give to him he hold nothing back to give to another person i need and by the way these were not junk cars there were a couple of new bmws in these his entire world ministry is based on him giving and people giving back to him he has been fauithful and so the lord has been faithful
126960 kohus leidis et s distatavapoolset tahtlust rikkuda liiklus ja s iduki k itusn udeid ei ole kohtumenetluses
126961 at that point i couldnt really tell where my body was going
126962 i feel rejuvenated i feel like im ready to play football again
126963 it allowed those defensive ends that were here to work their way through the practice and play fast
126964 it was just something id push through and push through and after a while it kind of goes downhill
126965 he looked like he was moving around well i heard him talking a few times which is always a good sign because he wasnt talking a lot the other day
126966 it was to fulfill the word that is written in their law they hated me without a cause
126967 wake up bestir yourself for my defense for my cause o my god
126968 then my tongue shall tell of your praise all day long
126969 remember the word that i said to you servants are not greater than their master
126970 i do not call you servants any longer because the servant does not know what the master is doing but i have called you friends
126971 if i had not done among them the works that no one else did
126972 vaya ya estoy viendo otra mierda de pel cula italiana
126973 i always thought i would play about five years and have a couple of kids and retire
126974 im kind of unique i really love the game and i go out and play for fun i think with annika its a lot of hard work every time she tees it up shes expected to win her work ethic is just grind grind work out hit balls
126975 i dont think annika could come out here and finish 15th on the money list and live with herself me im ok with that i enjoy what i do i love playing golf but its not the end of the world for me
126976 he could be better than the big brown leading up to the kentucky derby
126977 every work is progressively faster the track should suit him perfectly
126978 he said well ive got to tell you i dont know that youre going to see the guy from seattle
126979 i said were not looking for that guy from seattle
126980 what were looking for is for you to use your instincts
126981 between the 30 plus club and the defensive end situation and tight end situation i had to pull back on them we just didnt do the live periods we normally do in pads but we still got all the work done that needed to be done
126982 you talk to guys who come here from other teams and to guys you know around the league we do have a pretty hard camp
126983 ive heard from the veterans that this is one of the hardest camps in the nfl
126984 i think theres an adjustment period for new players in our system whether they are rookies or whether they are veteran guys we got through free agency
126985 its a little different here and in the end we all work toward making it a good environment for the player i think this is a tough tough thing that we do here
126986 you know im a defensive player so theres no such thing as too much hitting
126987 you dont want to hit your own guys all the time but i dont think its too much im a safety thats what i do
126988 i mean i dont want to cheap shot a guy like if theres a guy with his hands up im not going to try to decapitate him but at the same time thats how you get ready for the season the hitting
126989 it really doesnt matter to me i played for lou holtz in college
126990 some of my former teammates say they have better situations where they go
126991 of course some of those guys are on teams that arent very good look when you get in the games and youre not used to somebody hitting you more than likely youre going to fumble the football and stuff like that so you might as well get used to it
126992 that is where it started to go bad were playing good so hopefully that is where it starts to go great
126993 were back to the way we need to be playing
126994 getting hits making plays making pitches and winning when we lost we were playing bad so the losses felt heavy we seem to be more focused on the next game when the game is over win or lose its about trying to go out and win that next game i think that has a lot to do with attitude
126995 i just think it was probably one of those things where he had that talk because of how we were playing
126996 i think slumps only last so long so i think everybody pulled out of it so if you want to say it was due to the talk or if you want to say it was due to the prolonged slumps coming to an end either way
126997 you definitely can have too many meetings but i felt like at that time it was needed of course we come out and go 5 1 thats good if we go 10 1 and lose a couple believe me ill have another meeting i dont know if that has anything to do with it or not
126998 everybody came out here together and its something ive always liked about haddonfield
126999 there is a sense of community here and you are always representing more than yourself
127000 my goals right now are to take it one round at a time get to the final in beijing and go from there
127001 im in good shape right now and i think im ready to run faster than 4 05
127002 i would definitely like to run a four flat or better in the next few years and i intend to keep competing through the next olympics
127003 thats a lack of preparation from nascar to goodyear to the indianapolis motor speedway to put on a show like that
127004 i dont think you can put 100 percent of the blame on goodyear for this one
127005 was the most pathetic racing tire ive ever been on in my professional career
127006 we dont like to see anybodys day ruined because of our tires
127007 the lean of the tires helps the car turn through the corners
127008 but on a straightaway a lot of camber is fairly abusive on the tires because youre riding on the shoulder of the tires a long way while the tread makes less contact with the racing surface
127009 everybodys trying to find every nook and cranny to go faster but to every decision that will move you forward on a racetrack there are potential consequences
127010 the rfid chip is very robust its smaller than the eraser on a pencil and its installed near the meatiest toughest part of the tire
127011 so were 100 percent certain when one of our tires is missing
127012 wir wollen das ergebnis nicht berbewerten aber es macht uns mut f r das n chste duell mit den kroaten

127015 ich bin unendlich traurig dass ich in peking nicht spielen kann aber es gibt keine chance dass ich rechtzeitig gesund werde
127016 there is no one like our god no one at all
127017 oh my god that was one of the biggest rapids i have run in a long time
127018 this is your period this is not a jog through
127019 were concentrating on turnovers so lets get turnovers i care about the ball in the air
127020 got into online racing about a year and a half ago and actually thats how i met him
127021 he goes three wide at talladega at 300 miles an hour
127022 you can see that he had a lot of interceptions in college and you always want to see if that carries over to the pro game
127023 in these practices you see him getting his hands on the ball and making catches
127024 that makes him a valuable guy if he can continue to improve in those areas
127025 asante is a little bit away but hes getting closer
127026 they get in and normally work out a little bit hit the tubs get a little extra sleep
127027 theyre not just lying around these guys are a little older now and this is helping them and ill keep it going
127028 i think when youre in the dryer kind of going around and around you dont worry about all that stuff thats not what we worry about here and i know there are issues im sure theyre saying if brett shows up brett shows up i think mike
127029 but this is a tentative decision and we are focusing now on our response to the court
127030 the impact that energy consumption has on climate change and the species and habitats that we look at supporting so reducing power usage of our server operation was quite a big deal for us
127031 we would not even dream of getting into the support requirements of running a 24 7 web site infrastructure internally so we had to find a partner to take that support role the benefits apart from less power consumption are cost effectiveness and resilience due to the fact that systems run on a virtualised environment
127032 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
127033 last year we experienced more than 45m recalls of childrens products 30m of which were toys the cpsc discovered trouble with those products including lead content that was many times the allowable level and problems with small magnets that dislodge from the products those magnets are powerful so they attract to each other in the body
127034 there is a lot of great talent out there and rawvoice wants to remove the technical barriers so that talent can blossom in the new media space
127035 the rawvoice podcast publishing tools are a major step forward in accomplishing this vision
127036 we want to make podcasting easy whether you are starting out with 10 listeners or you have 100 000 listeners

127043 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
127044 its not a situation where you would expect any world records to be broken
127045 athletes breathe in ten times as much air into their lungs as spectators
127046 the pollution will cause their air passages to decrease in diameter so they will not be able to take as much air into their lungs which will affect their performance
127047 some of the athletes will suffer severe reactions and all will see impacts on their health
127048 i asked him did he consult he said it was just another tree
127049 there is no reliable or compelling evidence at the conclusion of the case that he was drinking anywhere on the apy lands
127050 i will quit my duties in an honourable just and responsible manner as i have acted throughout my mandate i will then prove my innocence
127051 i dont believe there are many chances that a government led by kadima can be formed as the political world has entered such a zone of turbulence that it will be difficult to restore calm
127052 but when you lose a couple it puts some extra emphasis on this particular test and i think thats pretty obvious
127053 since the involvement of this group of coaches weve only lost once two test matches in a row so that puts a bit of extra edge on it a bit of extra stress id imagine
127054 theres always a lot of tension every test match that youre involved in particularly the big ones
127055 thats the way it should be i guess i think most people would go through that tension
127056 were very focused to do the best job we can i think people are doing that the teams doing that and thats all we can do
127057 weve just got to make sure that we remain focused on doing that and dont get our attention on other things that dont matter
127058 as to whether were going to be good enough we cant do any more than were doing
127059 looking on from last week theres definitely a few things you can see that perhaps are a little bit familiar
127060 but every time you watch the wallabies they do what they do pretty well and there was another example of that last weekend
127061 weve put in place some policies which we think will work and worked at those particularly hard and i think the guys feel good about that
127062 once youve made those decisions and get them into practice thats a great help so we made those decisions early
127063 its only inevitable that people from different countries and regions of the world dont see eye to eye on certain issues
127064 i dont think politicising the olympic games will do any good to address these issues
127065 it runs counter to the olympic spirit and also to the shared aspirations of the people of the world
127066 as always we will continue to provide facilities for foreign journalists coming to china to report
127067 of course we also hope the foreign reporters will abide by chinese laws and regulations
127068 we also hope you will provide objective reports of what you see here
127069 the implication is that foreign journalists should refrain from reporting stories that the government finds critical
127070 we are disappointed by the failure to reach an agreement overnight
127071 its up to the board now and edf to see if there is any way that this gap can be bridged
127072 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date
127073 the future of new nuclear in the uk doesnt depend on this particular edf deal
127074 i think we are absolutely committed to new nuclear power and if this deal is not able to go through for whatever reason we will be looking at plans to make sure we can continue with our foot on the floor because britain needs these new nuclear power stations

127077 no voy a dejar el am rica si las condiciones de negociaciones no son favorables para el club y para m
127078 si existiera algo atractivo nos sentar amos a conversar con el presidente y evaluar amos el ofrecimiento es l gico que quiero jugar en alg n equipo de europa que asista a la copa m s importante de clubes pero por el momento no hubo nada en concreto salvo lo del galatasaray que no se concret y que a n est n evaluando
127079 trabajo en el am rica para lograr lo que deseamos
127080 s lo hubo ofrecimiento del galatasaray pero s que hay clubes que me est n observando y eso no es de ahora
127081 la intenci n de esta reuni n con ustedes los comunicadores presentes es para disipar todas las dudas que existen en torno a las negociaciones del club am rica con algunos de los muchos clubes europeos mencionados
127082 tenemos que decirles que el club galasataray de turqu a fue el nico que hizo un ofrecimiento cierto sobre memo pero deseaban adquirirlo a pr stamo y se determin por el bien de l ochoa y del club am rica que no se pod a hacer la negociaci n
127083 de ah en m s no hubo ni hay un acercamiento real con el equipo am rica sabemos que se han publicado muchos nombres pero memo tiene un contrato con nosotros hasta despu s del mundial 2010 y la intenci n de que lo cumpla
127084 la intenci n del am rica no es vender jugadores sino formarlos para que con ellos obtengamos campeonatos aunque es l gico que si hay un ofrecimiento que convenga a los intereses de cualquier jugador y del club se tratar el tema de manera especial
127085 llamamos a 23 jugadores para los entrenamientos del 4 5 y 6 de agosto se har otra concentraci n la pr xima semana del 11 al 13 la anunciaremos el d a 7
127086 est basada en lo que vimos los t cnicos en el ltimo mes vimos el rendimiento algunas cosas que nos gustaron no tuvimos m s tiempo
127087 fue fundamental fue dif cil hacer esta lista vimos a muchos jugadores muchos que s lo hab amos visto en video las recomendaciones de alberto y paco son muy importantes
127088 vimos muchos juegos muy buenos la mayor a siempre lo he dicho los mexicanos son muy fuertes tomamos la decisi n con calma no soy nervioso para esto
127089 ser de conocimiento adem s realizaremos trabajo t ctico en defensa y ataque
127090 el lunes hablar con todos los jugadores ser un entrenamiento corto porque vienen de jugar el martes habr doble pr ctica y el mi rcoles s lo una por la ma ana porque por la tarde tienen que regresar a sus clubes
127091 facilite todo la lengua del futbol es muy f cil hoy el futbol es velocidad y t cnica todos los jugadores mexicanos son fuertes tienen t cnica y velocidad
127092 claro que hay presi n siempre la hay pero me gusta si no existe el trabajo no vale de nada
127093 claro contra honduras ya tendremos la oportunidad de convocar a los jugadores que est n en europa muy fuertes son todos ellos
127094 no s cu ntos ser n llamados es muy temprano para decirlo con seguridad
127095 los jugadores que est n en europa est n sosteniendo partidos amistosos tenemos a tod gripp su otro auxiliar para controlar todo desde all ya vio el juego entre el stuttgart pavel pardo y ricardo osorio y el arsenal carlos vela
127096 vamos a esperar a esta convocatoria para decidir hay tiempo tenemos hasta el lunes para mandarlas
127097 espero que s blanco tal vez s tal vez no
127098 i am absolutely determined with everything ive ever done in my life to see it through and i will lead us through to the next election
127099 i said to him that i expect he will announce his future plans when he is ready to do so
127100 when i look back at peters career hes never had the balls to challenge or make a move or actually move to get the job in circumstances where he could have got it
127101 im not saying he cant come back but the polls still say hes largely unelectable
127102 hes got a long way to go and there are a number of people in the party that have ambition
127103 there are plenty who will have a go at the right time so i dont think its going to be an easy passage for peter whenever and im not sure that hell ever be drafted
127104 in that sense hes going to have to move something he hasnt characteristically done in his entire career
127105 people have said to me from the day that i took this job they said look its the worst job in australia in politics
127106 but if i listened to commentators instead of doing what i think is right then id be losing objectivity
127107 brendan nelson is our leader he has the support of the party room and beyond that i make a golden rule of not commenting on leadership questions
127108 of course he said earlier in the year he was going to retire from politics
127109 if he wants to change his mind he is entitled to do so in his own good time and he will let us know in his own good time
127110 we got agreement from one club and they were trying to get agreement on players from the other club
127111 we were involved we couldnt get where they wanted to be and we couldnt get where we wanted to be
127112 its just that weve got to please our club a little bit we think we know what the value of those players are not only the players on one side of the fence but on our side of the fence you have to really evaluate that and we just thought maybe that was a little too rich of an ask for us
127113 i think the pitching is always a concern if our position players perform as we anticipate or have performed in the past offensively and defensively we should have no problem weve got to be more consistent from a pitching standpoint and an offensive standpoint just to maintain some sort of consistency
127114 the role hes in at the moment is sort of unfair to him
127115 we possibly are going to look at making an adjustment
127116 im not afraid to pitch happ out of the bullpen
127117 well see you never know when hes going to get into a game we could put him in a game early and let him go like the other day when eaton came in if a guy gets knocked out in the second or third inning he could pitch four or five innings getting him work is the big thing keeping him sharp
127118 hes a much better defensive player than i remember seeing he gets a big hit for you every now and then
127119 we love defense as a team because we have a lot of guys who can get at it defensively cause some havoc and make a lot of plays
127120 removing the record is the right thing to do pure and simple
127121 the commissioner preferred to let those discussions continue rather than act on the reinstatement petition today
127122 have a 100 percent graduation rate and the atmosphere that coach wright and his coaching staff have is great
127123 coach wright is honest he just wants the best for his players and the family atmosphere he creates is something you cant find anywhere else
127124 get better in the classroom and on the basketball court
127125 it could be a while before the investigation comes to a conclusion
127126 do what i say and youll get a chocolate bar dont and mommy wont be happy
127127 in quanto abitanti della zona e confinanti con la suddetta nuova urbanizzazione

127130 mi chiedete se tremonti si dimesso non mi risulta c stata una forza politica che ha messo come aut aut o noi o tremonti e davanti alla necessit che il governo prosegua la sua strada berlusconi si fatto interprete di questa richiesta dopodich tutto il resto solo fantasia politica
127131 non stato un bel vertice noi avevamo lobiettivo di portare a casa lok da parte degli alleati sul federalismo e sulle date che devono essere rispettate questo arrivato ed un segnale positivo per il resto si apre una fase da affrontare con cautela da parte di tutti
127132 we will start the campaign program this weekend anwar is heading to penang to launch it
127133 nothing is going to stop anwars return to politics unless the ruling government cheats with the use of phantom voters and vote buying
127134 i think they may act against him but we hope the authorities will act in a fair and just manner and do not arrest him
127135 we have to be realistic it will be tough we will do our best
127136 if everybody is thinking alike then somebody isnt thinking pl 1 cement3s coolgray4s og citrus 11s 12s
127137 our podcasts give people from every corner of the earth the chance to fall in love with yellowstone and become its stewards for the future
127138 while nothing can replace a personal experience in a national park we think our podcasts will enhance peoples trips or give them the opportunity to learn about a park that they cant visit
127139 whether people download them to portable devices or watch them on their computers these free electronic presentations give us another way to serve park enthusiasts of all ages
127140 just like the earlier version of nature notes our podcasts tell yosemites stories from the perspective of the people who work here
127141 i like the idea that weve brought this institution back to life and that we use new media to put a personal face on the national park service
127142 my favorite podcast about canyonlands national park is the one on potholes
127143 it was so interesting to learn that tiny creatures are living in a bunch of dirt
127144 they loved being the experts and teaching us their parents what they learned while we walked around the park
127145 rather than having to watch the video at the permit station which is required more and more visitors have watched it online ahead of time
127146 personally i dont think that people are going to give up on the real thing
127147 after learning about parks from our online resources people want to get outside and explore on their own
127148 non cercare nelle parole e nel timbro del suono quellarmonia che da senso ma ascolta lintervallo non la nota ma il suo silenzio
127149 inquiries to date lead me to believe this incident was a case of mistaken identity
127150 it is vital that we trace this woman as soon as possible
127151 not too far im in kkp ok listen im gonna be a bit late im with kn and on my way to his brothers hostel nearby we should be done soon so dont worry ill be home in a while
127152 okay o by the way s had called for you he called like four times in the last 10 min he seemed a little worried his sister called too

127169 if its not saturday but next week well not make a big fuss about it what matters is to get a clear answer quickly in the very coming days
127170 we are continuing our double approach of dialogue and pressure if dialogue does not work we could continue with additional pressure at the u n or eu level
127171 it is so scary it makes me remember the shells landing here and there the ground shaking and ear splitting artillery explosions
127172 if it flares up we will be sitting ducks like we were before the ceasefire
127173 i pray sanity prevails on both armies and they dont turn again our villages into a firing ranges
127174 i dont see or feel any tension here we are all relaxed
127175 there is nothing serious i am sure the recent firing was aimed to give cover to terrorists

127412 a michelle disse me que uma experi ncia de aprendizagem e espera n o voltar a repeti lo
127413 mas quando se tem apenas 15 anos de idade e se est a competir contra as melhores do mundo isso deve ser encarado como um sinal positivo para se cuidar e trabalhar e avan ar no seu tipo de jogo
127414 assim acredito que nos pr ximos anos devemos assistir a grandes feitos da michelle o que ser grandioso para portugal e contribuir para inspirar as crian as portuguesas a jogarem t nis
127415 michelle uma lutadora e tem um grande esp rito para se tornar numa tenista do

127417 vou continuar a seguir o seu percurso ela tem estado connosco desde menina e acreditamos que melhorar cada vez mais estou muito orgulhoso dela e feliz por ela treinar nesta academia
127418 os nossos objectivos centram se na conquista de uma etapa e na coloca o de um corredor no p dio julgo que temos reunidas as condi es para apresentarmos um bloco forte que combina a experi ncia e a juventude

127421 i will quit my duties in an honourable just and responsible manner as i have acted throughout my mandate i will then prove my innocence
127422 i dont believe there are many chances that a government led by kadima can be formed as the political world has entered such a zone of turbulence that it will be difficult to restore calm
127423 roland kommt meist von der linken seite ist sehr schnell beidf ig und besitzt unheimlich viel potenzial
127424 grunds tzlich ist es so dass wenn alle drei parteien wollen ein transfer in den meisten f llen auch klappt
127425 wir haben mit roland gesprochen jetzt machen wir uns unsere gedanken und er ebenfalls dann wird sich zeigen ob er kommt oder nicht
127426 the growing economic interdependence of countries worldwide through increasing volume and variety of cross border transactions in goods and services freer international capital flows and more rapid and widespread diffusion of technology
127427 freedom and ability of individuals and firms to initiate voluntary economic transactions with residents of other countries
127428 this definition implies the human dimension of globalization which emphasizes on economic interactions
127429 as unconvinced by my own answers as i was by everyone elses
127430 the growing expectations that the public has of presidents creates a gap between expectations and formal powers
127431 marie that is such a chic outfit you look as beautiful today as i have ever seen you
127432 mr lebeau i want you to stop making comments on my personal appearance i am not here as a decoration i am here as an employee i take a real pride in what i do but all you can talk about is the way i look can you imagine how that makes me feel i have tried to discourage you but it seems you wont take a hint from now on can you please treat me with a bit more respect and professionalism

127434 inter ikea systems b v constantly seeks market expansion and grants new franchises to markets territories according to a detailed expansion plan
127435 all marketing is based on the ikea business idea we shall offer a wide range of home furnishing items of good design and function at prices so low that the majority of people can afford to buy them
127436 denying those benefits to a couple whose relationship is genuine is neither a rational nor a proportionate response to the legitimate aims of a firm and fair immigration policy
127437 my lords this scheme is an arbitrary and unjust interference with the right to marry
127438 even in these days when many in british society believe that there is little social difference between marrying and living together marriage still has deep significance for many people quite apart from the legal recognition status rights and obligations which it brings

127457 pe investors are actively looking at opportunities in the sector they have good amount of money which is already raised and approved projects get funds readily
127458 today public equity is not giving fair value for the projects while private equity is willing to do so this deal is an indication that enough liquidity is available for quality players we are also in talks with lehman for similar deals
127459 it all depends on the project pes are quite open to invest if the valuations are right the developer has a good track record and the project has good potential however our return expectations have gone up as the risk perception about the indian real estate has also gone up

127470 threatens to increase the chances of a nuclear arms race in the subcontinent
127471 the agreement is a sound one based on the iaeas approved safeguards system
127472 the question is not will it be approved or will it not be approved the question is what will the deal look like at the end of the day
127473 my expectation is that the nsg will eventually agree to the some exemption to india from its rules but will not be a clear exemption

127475 nobody is going to trust the north korean number they have given on plutonium they made
127476 the ball is in the north korean court and we will see what they come up with
127477 in the battle of iraq the united states and our allies have prevailed
127478 the akp had been convicted for committing a crime against secularism by the 10 of the 11 members of the constitutional court
127479 so that the akp was not acquitted by the constitutional court
127480 from now on political parties will pay for their mistakes only at ballot boxes
127481 youd have to build a long one and the stability of the tunnel given the geological nature would require an awful lot of bolting and the price was considered too high
127482 we are doing some asphalt overlay on the road down below but thats all
127483 although i seem to tolerate introspection better the older i am there are still too many claims on my attention to permit more than the briefest excursions down the path of self awareness when i am no longer busy with politics and with my own ambitions i hope to have more time to examine what i have done and failed to do with my career and why
127484 its his voice but im going inside his head to speak some psychological truth about him
127485 no one is closer to mccain than salter who has been with him since 1989

127491 some view the flag as a symbol of slavery others view it as a symbol of heritage personally i see the battle flag as a symbol of heritage
127492 should be lowered forever from the staff atop south carolinas capitol
127493 it is very refreshing for zimbabweans to hear the negotiators saying the process is going on very well especially when it comes from the opposition and it comes from morgan tsvangirai himself it is good to hear that but again it is too early for ordinary zimbabweans to celebrate because as you know that there is a media blackout and we dont know exactly what they are discussing and if they are saying they are proceeding very well we dont know what is well but with tsvangirai we would have to hope that they mean well for the people of zimbabwe
127494 i dont think that if tsvangirai is saying the talks are going very well and they mean that mugabe will remain the helm of government mugabe remains the state president i dont think i will describe that as well because as long as you have mugabe in the leadership in whatever position but still the head there is no well in the talks because i dont think that is what the zimbabweans want
127495 zimbabweans want a new set of leadership even if it is transitional i dont think they now need a name called mugabe
127496 that is a very good move by the opposition when the talks started we said we were very skeptical about mugabes intentions we believed that he was only asking the opposition and the opposition asking zanu pf to come up with its lists of demands and the proposal that came from zanu pf shows that mugabes intention was to swallow the opposition and surely we cannot be creating vice presidents anytime there is a crisis and when there are negotiations we solve that by creating vice presidents
127497 the progress in iraq has allowed us to continue our policy of return on success
127498 this time horizon is a planning tool not a definitive schedule
127499 before it was a status of forces agreement presented as a long term agreement with some hope one day foreign troops will end their mandate
127500 now we are talking about when foreign forces are going to cease their operations
127501 i think we have to wait until those negotiations finish to really know the details
127502 die geringen ver nderungen zeigen aber dass die betriebe derzeit keine rezession erwarten
127503 f r das kommende quartal sind die erwartungen der betriebe deutlich verhaltener als vor jahresfrist nur noch 10 prozent vorjahr 16 erwarten eine verbesserung der gesch ftslage 11 prozent 16 gehen von steigenden ums tzen aus
127504 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its economic problems
127505 in every case homosexual practice is considered sinful something that breaks our relationship with god and harms our wellbeing
127506 it is something for which one should repent and seek forgiveness and healing which god is ever ready to do
127507 when the archbishop of canterbury invited these american bishops to participate in the lambeth conference in the face of the unrelenting commitment of the american church to bless sinful behaviour we were stunned further betrayal
127508 even the pope is elected by his peers but what anglicans have is a man appointed by a secular government
127509 over the past five years we have come to see this as a remnant of british colonialism and it is not serving us well

127517 well its not our home ground but its our home state
127518 i know theyll be flying to the game and well be driving
127519 but its always nice to have the home crowd support and i think there will probably be more brisbane supporters than kangaroos supporters
127520 and that always gives a bit of emotional stimulus to the players
127521 if we win three games then i guess we play finals if we win five then we definitely play
127522 having said that the margin for error is getting greatly reduced
127523 you would rather win now than be thinking well know weve got to win our last three
127524 weve had a couple of games where if we had played better in the final minute we would have won but we didnt and we lost them

127529 this is something we have wanted to do for a very long time mainly because major retailers come to us and want to be part of coolsprings galleria and we have not had space for them said mall

127533 90 of people cant touch ones elbow with ones tongue
127534 loop through the numbers and check whether each number is divisible by 3 or 5 then print the answer depending on that test
127535 how would you know if it was divisible by 3
127536 what are you trying to achieve maybe there is another solution
127537 the mechanical part of writing and solving fizzbuzz however cleverly is irrelevant any programmer who cares enough to read programming blogs is already far beyond such a simple problem
127538 is there a term for people who compulsively answer rhetorical questions
127539 you dont need to write code just explain how youd do it
127540 im going to ask you a series of simple questions
127541 get out there take chances get messy and make mistakes
127542 oh yeah i can solve it in n 1 statements
127543 do you want a card punch machine with or without a working ribbon
127544 right toss that lot and lets start over with xyz language
127545 real programmers adapt to the workplace to a certain extent and are comfortable working with languages that arent necessarily their ultimate favorite in order to get the job done tm
127546 you took 15 minutes to work it out you suck
127547 thats cargo cult programming following rules that originally had a good purpopose
127548 why should i memorize something i can so easily get from a book
127549 so why not use this to the advantage of codinghorror wright a weekly challenge or something one it could be fun and two it might be a good way to learn from other people there is never just one way of doing things it would be interesting to see how other people solve problems bryan
127550 build me a wikipedia style intranet in the next eight months
127551 why not just install the wikimedia and spend a few weeks modding it
127552 discuss the difference between assignment in c c and java
127553 will the special outputs change often or are they constant forever
127554 hmm yes it sounds like a really simple problem anyone should be able to cope with but id better check it myself to make sure there isnt a hidden twist
127555 1 n2 nfizz n4 nbuzz nfizz n7 n8 nfizz nbuzz n11 nfizz n13 n14 nfizz n16 n17 nfizz n19 nbuzz nfizz n22 n23 nfizz nbuzz n26 nfizz n28 n29 nfizz n31 n32 nfizz n34 nbuzz nfizz n37 n38 nfizz nbuzz n41 nfizz n43 n44 nfizz n46 n47 nfizz n49 nbuzz nfizz n52 n53 nfizz nbuzz n56 nfizz n58 n59 nfizz n61 n62 nfizz n64 nbuzz nfizz n67 n68 nfizz nbuzz n71 nfizz n73 n74 nfizz n76 n77 nfizz n79 nbuzz nfizz n82 n83 nfizz nbuzz n86 nfizz n88 n89 nfizz n91 n92 nfizz n94 nbuzz nfizz n97 n98 nfizz nbuzz n
127556 why do we have to ask people to write fizzbuzz
127557 salary expectations within range check degree check two years of java check able to program sorry hr cant handle that one
127558 1 2 fizz 4 buzz 5 fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz 13 14 fizzbuzz
127559 and instead of writing fizzbuzz code they should be thinking about ways to prevent us from needing fizzbuzz code in the first place
127560 and instead of taking tests they should be thinking about ways to prevent us from needing to take tests in the first place
127561 the interviewer who is expecting and eventually selecting a programmer to developing the fizzbuzz logic in less than couple of minutes is actually trying to build a team for a project which is more than likely to lead to failure and waste millions of dollars and leading the project stakeholders to suicidal death
127562 so i guess that this isnt the time to write my solution

127602 its not as helpful as it first seems given the overall cost of books and how early you need to order
127603 many students dont have a final book list yet for their classes or they arent back and it doesnt do anything for the round of books needed for second semester

127629 so what do people think of windows vista when they dont know its windows vista
127630 this was part of a new microsoft marketing drive codenamed ftp which im guessing means fool the people or possibly something less polite
127631 basically microsoft rounds up a bunch of users who are so out of the loop they dont know vista when they see it and gives them ten minutes with a demo of vista not free reign mind you but clearly something controlled and monitored its a safe bet that not a single one of these victims had actually used this os before receiving their ten minutes of ms window dressing and this is supposed to change the minds of anyone who actually experienced the ultrafail that is vista wow

127703 its like a drug some people choose heroin but ive chosen food and its killing me
127704 shri krishna has become the virata the great primordial being so this is the 11th power of destruction he has the power called samhara shakti by which he kills people so before killing them and finishing them off in the compassion of your mother we have to first try to transform them if they cannot be transformed then its alright then let ekadasha take over so these 11 very great destructive powers will be used by the kalki the one who is going to manifest on a white horse before that today is a very great day that we are going to use these powers for transformation
127705 there is a very perfect mechanism placed along the spinal chord like a remote control and it has seven loops which is called soul in the scriptures the soul is responsible for looking after our well being the righteousness and goodness within the human mind it saves us from our destruction by controlling the inner atmosphere of the cell through the receptor when this soul is challenged by the wrong deeds of a person it acts on the receptor of a cell that would otherwise ultimately disturb the inner atmosphere of the cell changing the series of the data base units of the cell in the d n a thus from the genes one can know the character of the person which is very much acquired even the chromosomes which are called autosomes which are for the physical aspect can get into changes like kobe steaks or broiled chicken even in human beings it goes into shapes of the body which can be acquired by physical emotional or mental activity these genes could be partly inherent not being in a proper series before birth according to the nature of the mother and father because of our day to day life especially in modern times which disturbs the inner atmosphere of the cell thus disturbances change the series of data bases indicating the total character genetically inherent or acquired by the person
127706 yesterday as i told you that when we do dhyana dharana and samadhi and achieve the blessings of the ritambhara pragnya then put that whole thing on different areas called as desha or bhoomi how to spend them is the point is through mantras cleanse it through mantras cleanse it through your attention everyday you must know which chakra to be cleared out you must know about yourself where is the problem how it is to be cleansed how we have to clear it out do not take it for granted many people who have got say left sided problems you will just bring them lemon and chilies and think that mother has done the job i can only do the job temporarily but if there is a vacuum again you will suck in you see these vacuums within you feel hungry again to have some more so to take out that vacuum is your job and for that you have to religiously get out of all your defects thats the most important thing for all of you and try to put full attention to all these different deshas is the nations as they are called as and once you have cleared it it is enlightened is full of light then you call it pradesh means the desha has been enlightened once that is achieved then you have reached a point you can become a guru but still you are not a sat guru to become a sat guru you must achieve the state of ateeta
127707 we should be careful when we express our views about the nature of others and their doings by keeping in mind that our knowledge is always incomplete
127708 jason bay is the most underrated player in the national league
127709 he can do many things well ive always enjoyed watching him he can run play defense hit hit for power hell grow on you when you see him every day because hes a quality all around player
127710 no question about that but jason can do a lot of things that manny cant do he brings a lot to the table
127711 thats kind of special to me thats pretty neat getting to play in the same spot as the guys he idolized
127712 im not trying to replace anybody which i think is how a lot of people are going to look at it
127713 im not trying to be manny ram rez lets be honest hes one of the best players in the game im not going to hit 50 homers i like to say i do a handful of things that are going to stand out i try to be solid first and foremost im just trying to be me
127714 im the guy i was the three years before that putting up the numbers
127715 its not an excuse maybe a reason im the guy i had been before not the guy i was last year
127716 hes not going to be manny ram rez everybodys got to understand that
127717 its about 411 in the gap in pnc and 380 behind me
127718 itll be a lot less running that i dont think anyone would be too upset about
127719 ive almost been traded in the offseason maybe to the braves
127720 it was something that was probably inevitable given the state of the franchise them getting rid of xavier nady and damaso marte to the yankees this was something from the offseason that i had anticipated would happen
127721 well have to play it by ear if ive got to hate him for an extended period of time thats what ill have to do
127722 the most important thing that ive found out so far about the red sox organization is that we dont have to wear suits on the plane
127723 ive been wearing a full suit on the plane so im excited to dress down
127724 you were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within you its not just in some of us its in everyone and as you let your own light shine you unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as you are liberated from your own fear your presence automatically liberates others
127725 always remain in the centre do not worry about your growth in
127726 warum trennt ihr sie ist f r euch nicht alles ein und dasselbe
127727 aber jeder einzelne ist auf seine eigene art zufrieden isst ein mensch das gras das die kuh gern frisst schmeckt der kuh das essen der menschen man soll mensch und tier nur das geben was jeden zufriedenstellt
127728 now these ekadesha rudras come out of as i told you from the void so we can say that the destruction part of it comes from the void mainly but these are the powers all given in one
127729 shri krishna has become the virata the great primordial being so this is the 11th power of destruction he has the power called samhara shakti by which he kills people so before killing them and finishing them off in the compassion of your mother we have to first try to transform them if they cannot be transformed then its alright then let ekadasha take over so these 11 very great destructive powers will be used by the kalki the one who is going to manifest on a white horse before that today is a very great day that we are going to use these powers for transformation
127730 so today i was thinking that well have the puja of shri vishnu who was the basis of dharma so far we have never worshipped anyone who were the basics except for shiva we only worshipped the incarnations ganesha came as incarnation the goddess came as incarnations rama shri krishna gurus christ buddha all of them came as incarnations on this earth and we worshipped the specially but today as sahaja yoga is established is dharma we have to know about shri vishnu who is the basis of dharma later on and ultimately as kalki it is a beautiful so one has to understand what is the basis of dharma if you know in the matter there are eight valences theyre negative positive and neutral but in human beings there are ten valences and these ten valences are created by shri vishnu within us they are protected looked after and nourished by shri vishnu and whenever he finds human beings falling down in their dharma on this earth ultimate stage is the virat at that stage this vishnu principle divides into two one goes to virat another to viratangana but the third principle is what you call as the mahavishnu which incarnated as lord jesus christ so all these three principles act at this time in sahasrara mainly
127731 in evolution every incarnation has come on this earth to open a door within us and to create that opening or that enlightenment in our awareness
127732 now if you study the etymology of the word christ you would know that the word has originated from a corrupted form of the word krishna as a matter of fact the father of jesus christ is shri krishna that is why he is called christ the manner in which his name jesus originated is also very interesting the mother of shri krishna shri yashoda mata was addressed as yesu even today we notice that in northern india somebody named yeshu is not addressed as such but as jesus it is therefore clear that from yashoda came the word yeshu and then further became the word finally the name jesus christ
127733 shri ganesha is the eldest brother of all the sahaja yogis in the university of sahaja yoga one has to be registered through the permission of shri ganesha who is responsible for judging every student sadhaka who wants to enrol in the university after passing through four classes of four chakras nabhi chakra swadhisthan chakra ridhaya chakra and vishuddhi chakra shri ganesha bestows a graduation degree upon the pupil as chancellor of the university where this is the awakened stage of the sadhaka
127734 so all the miracles of god cannot be explained and should not be explained they are beyond our mind and to make people feel the presence of god god can do anything he can move into all the dimensions a nd also into the fourth dimension he can do whatever he feels like
127735 you are as stupid as everyone else you are nothing but a fake
127736 tell me if you buy a gift for someone and that person does not take it to whom does the gift belong
127737 it would belong to me because i bought the gift
127738 that is correct and it is exactly the same with your anger if you become angry with me and i do not get insulted then the anger falls back on you you are then the only one who becomes unhappy not me all you have done is hurt yourself
127739 if you want to stop hurting yourself you must get rid of your anger and become loving instead
127740 substance abuse varies significantly depending upon the purpose for which these are used for example 28 6 of those drinking alcohol do so to help them get to know a potential sexual partner while 26 2 of those using cocaine take it to make sexual intercourse last longer
127741 those who consume alcohol cannabis cocaine or ecstasy under the age of 16 are likely to have had sexual relations before this age too
127742 the current patterns of drug use among the study participants reflect their number of sexual partners with regular cocaine users in comparison with those who have never taken it being five times more likely to have had five or more sexual partners within the last 12 months or to have paid for sex
127743 prevention experts must be aware of how young people view the relationship between drug use and sexuality there are very few preventive programmes in our country that take this link into consideration
127744 now that we are aware of this link and the associated health risks new programmes and preventive strategies will be needed in addition to further research in the area of drug use and its social psychological and physical links to sexuality based on the real and important experiences of young people themselves
127745 organizations like the kenneth b schwartz center are an important tool in the fight against cancer as they help create better relationships between caregivers and patients by doing things like improving communication and helping caregivers be more emotionally present for their patients
127746 our mission is to support and enhance the patient caregiver relationship and much of our work takes place at cancer centers around the country so we are thrilled to be part of its survivor circle exhibit
127747 our findings indicate that the initial hospital costs associated with penetrating trauma are substantial and vary to a considerable degree by patient injury and treatment characteristics
127748 although the costs of penetrating trauma resulting from shooting are higher than from stabbing the most commonly used weapon in violent crime in england and wales is actually a knife
127749 at an average cost of 7 699 per penetrating injury from alleged assault and a total of 417 injuries per year requiring hospitalisation for at least three days the total acute care cost of this type of injury alone may exceed 3 2 million annually
127750 public health initiatives that aim to reduce the incidence and severity of penetrating trauma are therefore likely to produce significant savings in acute trauma care costs
127751 considering the additional medical costs of rehabilitation and broader costs to society resulting from lost productivity permanent disability premature death and the pain and suffering of the victims and their families there is a compelling argument for money to be better spent on prevention strategies that reduce violent incidents
127752 it should be borne in mind that most of the cost of trauma especially stabbing is not to the health service but in billions per annum to the taxpayer through legal costs loss of productive tax paying years in those that die or are severely disabled and in long term care
127753 giving comprehensible and appropriate information about survival benefit is extremely difficult in addition the reluctance to inform patients of the limited survival gain of palliative chemotherapy may be motivated by a desire to protect patients from bad news
127754 however the reluctance to address these difficulties and sensitivities may be hampering patients ability to make informed decisions about their future treatment
127755 ik had geen moeite met diederiks overstap naar de rooms katholieke kerk integendeel
127756 ons gezin was behoorlijk hecht ondanks drukte discussieerden we vaak en uitgebreid en deden we veel dingen samen
127757 maar wel stond voorop we zijn hervormd in de brede zin van het woord
127758 een prima school hoewel wij thuis niet zo hechtten aan uiterlijke kenmerken zoals de lange broek voor meisjes
127759 wij juichten beiden de vorming van het cda toe in een tijd van ontkerkelijking vonden wij het verstandig om een brede christelijke beweging op te zetten die invloed heeft op het beleid naast een kleine groep die meer gericht is op het getuigenis
127760 ik sportte enthousiast en was niet zon overdreven grote studiebol als jos bovendien maakt drie en een half jaar leeftijdsverschil in de puberteit nogal wat uit
127761 ik had veel belangstelling voor geschiedenis en theologie met theologie kon je vooral predikant worden ik vond dat je daarvoor een duidelijke roeping moest hebben daarvan was ik niet zeker dus werd het geschiedenis terwijl ik na een jaar theologie erbij ging doen in mijn studietijd woonde ik drie jaar bij onze oma in utrecht erg leuk vond ik dat het typeert ook onze familieband later woonden ook diederik en onze jongere zus annemarie bij oma wienen
127762 ik stelde kritische existenti le vragen niet dat ik niet in god geloofde of dat ik niet naar de kerk ging maar wel dat ik me afvroeg waarom god het kwade toelaat waarom er verschillende religies bestaan en dergelijke dat leidde ertoe dat ik moeite had met belijdenis doen frappant genoeg deed diederik dat eerder dan ik
127763 ik wilde op mijn zestiende al naar de belijdeniscatechisatie op advies van de predikant stelde ik dat een jaar uit waarna ik op mijn achttiende belijdenis deed ik ben dan ook vol overtuiging theologie gaan studeren
127764 weet je nog van die vraag van die franse chauffeur
127765 nou ja het ambt aller gelovigen o nee dat hebben jullie niet
127766 op de csfr in utrecht bestond de traditie om de contacten tussen oost en west europese studenten te stimuleren elk jaar ging er een utrechtse student in oost europa studeren zo kwam ik in polen terecht
127767 mijn studie in polen was vooral een verbreding van mijn persoonlijke en culturele horizon wat dat katholieke betreft al op de guido had ik discussies met klasgenoten over de rooms katholieke kerk ik las destijds ook de nieuwe katechismus en voelde daarbij geen enorme kloof met het rooms katholieke geloof maar ik had weinig contact met rooms katholieken
127768 ik wel ik had als kind een vriendinnetje uit een rooms katholiek gezin met wie ik ook meeging naar de kerk daar maakte ik mee dat ik geen eten kreeg omdat later die ochtend de eucharistie zou worden gevierd
127769 in polen ging ik ook wel naar rooms katholieke vieringen toen ik mijn theologiestudie in 1992 had afgerond meldde ik me aan bij de hervormde kerkelijke opleiding dat riep nogal wat vragen bij me op heb ik wel een roeping wat is de nederlandse hervormde kerk voor een kerk hoe kan de kerk zo onduidelijk omgaan met zaken als de zegening van homorelaties wat is de kern van het belijden van die kerk het kan toch niet zo zijn dat ik mijn eigen deuntje ga meeblazen als ik predikant ben word ik geacht het woord van god te verkondigen en niet een of andere priv opinie met deze vragen liep ik vast in de predikantenopleiding ik klopte daarop aan bij de grotere traditie van de kerk ik heb toen veel van augustinus gelezen en van kardinaal newman een 19e eeuwse theoloog die was overgegaan van de anglicaanse naar de rooms katholieke kerk protestanten zijn rationeler rooms katholieken hebben meer oog voor het leven als geheel in de liturgie spelen de zintuigen horen zien ruiken een belangrijker rol geloof is een zinvol mysterie dat was geen doorslaggevende overweging maar mijn overgang kreeg er wel meer kleur door fundamenteler was echter de vraag waar staat het christelijk geloof voor als het niet kan aansluiten bij de traditie van 2000 jaar ervoor ik zag in de protestantse kerk breuklijnen die ik niet kon verantwoorden uiteindelijk sloot ik de predikantenopleiding van de nederlandse hervormde kerk af met een toetreden tot de rooms katholieke kerk
127770 nee integendeel ik vond het fijn dat diederik zijn worstelingen met dit besluit kon be indigen toen diederik die keus maakte heb ik tegen hem gezegd als je een kerkelijke overstap m t maken is de enige mogelijkheid dat je rooms katholiek wordt mijn vrouw en ik hebben ook de dienst bijgewoond waarin diederik het vormsel kreeg anderen in de familie hadden meer moeite met diederiks keuze
127771 dat kan ik goed begrijpen de vooroordelen over de rooms katholieke kerk hebben een lange geschiedenis en trekken een diep spoor mijn keuze was echter een keuze met mijn hele bestaan mijn moeder had er het meeste moeite mee
127772 zij hoorde een keer kardinaal simonis heel persoonlijk spreken over zijn geloof in jezus christus dat raakte haar en stemde haar ook milder tegenover diederiks keuze
127773 voor mij is het een probleem dat de nederlandse hervormde kerk en haar opvolger de protestantse kerk in nederland te smal te nationaal is terwijl de kerk katholiek dat is ook wereldwijd dient te zijn maar ook weer niet zo breed dat zij op een religieus genootschap lijkt in mijn kerk kan een predikant zeggen dat god niet bestaat of beweren dat mohammed gelijk staat aan jezus maar overstappen dan zou ik breken met de kerk waarin ik het geloof heb leren kennen ik deed belijdenis in een kerk waarin ik beloofde mijn verantwoordelijkheden op mij te nemen dat weegt voor mij heel zwaar mij spreekt in de traditie van de reformatie de gerichtheid op gods woord aan daarom heb ik moeite met de nieuwe leerstellingen van de rooms katholieke kerk waarvan petrus en paulus niet hadden durven dromen neem de mariadogmas zoals maria tenhemelopneming en de onbevlekte ontvangenis van maria verder ervaar ik de breuk in de tijd van de reformatie als schuld maar die ligt toch vooral bij de rooms katholieke kerk de reformatoren wilden niet uit de kerk stappen maar de kerk hervormen zij werden echter uit de kerk gezet de rooms katholieke kerk heeft in die tijd op een verschrikkelijke manier gefaald aan de andere kant is de rooms katholieke kerk dankzij haar structuur orthodox gebleven en hecht ik aan haar ongebroken traditie en geloof in een drie enig god ik zoek geen individuele terugkeer maar herstel van de breuk in de kerk
127774 ik kan jouw redenering volgen mijn overgang was vooral een persoonlijke keuze er ligt gezamenlijke schuld vanwege de kerkelijke breuk ik vind het goed dat de rooms katholieke kerk in de oecumenische contacten niet meer over terugkeer spreekt maar over herstel van de eenheid van al jezus leerlingen voor mij bemiddelt de kerk het heil in christus de bijbel spreekt ook niet letterlijk over de drie eenheid toch was het goed dat de kerk die leerstelling later heeft afgekondigd zo kwam de kerkelijke beslissing welke boeken in de canon van de heilige schrift werden opgenomen ook niet zomaar uit de lucht vallen in diezelfde lijn zie ik de mariadogmas voor mij verhelderen die het geloof in christus ze zijn afgekondigd in een tijd dat vrijzinnige kritiek op de traditionele geloofsdogmas luid klonk ik vind het een verrijking in de rooms katholieke traditie dat zij meer plaats geeft aan volksdevotie dat mensen een persoonlijke band kunnen hebben met maria of heiligen zolang die in n lijn ligt met het geloof in christus de protestantse traditie loopt het gevaar het geloof te verengen tot iets verstandelijks zon overtuiging kan echter veranderen begrijp me goed ik ben overtuigd rooms katholiek wat mij echter staande houdt is niet mijn overtuiging maar mijn geloof in de kerk zelf daar mag ik met vallen en opstaan in delen in lijn met augustinus zeg ik uiteindelijk geloof ik het evangelie omdat het gezag van de kerk mij ertoe beweegt
127775 ik zie mijn overstap wel als een breuk maar niet als een verloochening ik ben dankbaar voor wat ik meekreeg vanuit mijn protestantse achtergrond dat is van blijvende waarde
127776 klopt we hebben stuivertje gewisseld toen we een jaar of twintig waren hadden de mensen eerder gedacht dat jos deze stap zou zetten dan dat ik dat zou doen
127777 ik herken me ook in die beschrijving drie jaar geleden zijn diederik en ik samen met mijn zoon naar de rooms katholieke wereldjongerendagen geweest ik vond het indrukwekkend dat zo veel jonge mensen enthousiast hun geloof in jezus christus beleden dat overstijgt kerkmuren
127778 wat de politiek betreft voel ik me minder verbonden met n bepaalde partij zoals jos met het cda maar wel met bepaalde personen en een grotere democratische traditie met mensen als lubbers hirsch ballin en donner of om een buitenlander te noemen de onlangs overleden pool bronislaw geremek ook qua voorkeur voor literatuur verschillen we jos houdt van tolstoj ik meer van dostojevski dat zegt iets over onze voorkeuren tolstoj was de verteller dostojevski de existenti le zoeker
127779 tolstoj was een hartstochtelijk zoeker en christen toch zei hij dat als hijmoest kiezen tussen de waarheid en christus volgen hij de waarheid zou volgen terwijl dostojevski christus zou volgen en niet de waarheid natuurlijk een ondenkbare tegenstelling want voor een christen ligt de waarheid in christus
127780 ik kocht vroeger altijd meer boeken dan diederik nu bekijk ik uitgebreid zijn boekenkast het is een feest om bij hem te zijn en met hem over boeken te praten een accentverschil is dat mijn interesse meer uitgaat naar geschiedenis en die van diederik naar filosofie en literatuur onze belangstelling raakt elkaar bij augustinus en kerkgeschiedenis
127781 kinderen mogen in kenia pas naar school als ze kunnen lezen en schrijven
127782 we verkeerden echter in vakantiestemming dus wilden we eerst de tijd nemen om er in nederland rustig over na te denken
127783 we hadden een behoorlijk yuppenbestaan nieuw huis mooie meubels dure laptop snelle audi we vroegen ons s avonds echter vaak af wat voegt dit werk toe aan ons leven
127784 we nemen de concrete bijbelse opdracht om zorg te dragen voor wezen nu wel heel letterlijk
127785 mijn moeder is gestorven en mijn vader is opnieuw getrouwd af en toe ben ik thuis maar ik mag niet elke dag komen mijn tweede moeder wil me niet
127786 maar die druppel is er helpen is onze plicht deze hulp mag bijdragen aan een verandering in het leven van kinderen
127787 dat deed hij met een klasgenoot van mij van de kweekschool in onze verlovingstijd bouwden ze wel twintig bootjes per jaar s avonds en in het weekend
127788 doordeweeks handelde ik in bloembollen in het bedrijf van mijn vader
127789 we zeilden heen en weer voor de kust of voeren een dagje op en neer naar scheveningen
127790 omdat mijn schepen van polyester waren kon ik ze flying arrow noemen later bouwden we dankzij een betere techniek met een man of acht 600 boten per jaar
127791 we adverteerden in het blad arts amp auto omdat jaaps vader het verschil tussen bakboord en stuurboord niet wist mocht hij de klanten uit die sector helpen dat waren vaak artsen die er zelf ook geen verstand van hadden en dus geen moeilijke vragen stelden
127792 de catamaran was in opkomst en veel watersporters stapten over op de surfplank ik heb de zaak toen verkocht
127793 we zijn ten onder gegaan aan ons eigen succes de boten waren te goed en jaap verkocht er te veel
127794 je ziet mijn flying arrow nog veel in nederlandse jachthavens
127795 de mast van 25 meter was net zo hoog als de vuurtoren van noordwijk
127796 zonder kaart en bij een verkeerde uiterton de eerste boei in zee als de schipper land in zicht krijgt red is jaap op zn gevoel en met de radar de surinamerivier opgevaren
127797 we troffen een oude bende aan een roestige loodsboot personeel met gescheurde kleren ik dacht werkelijk met een stel drenkelingen van doen te hebben
127798 ook aan de wal was het ene bende al die gebouwe stonde op een soort van instorte
127799 eigenlijk mochten we helemaal niet aan die steiger liggen maar omdat ik hielp met de reparatie van bij de steiger gezonken boten werden we uiteindelijk dikke vrienden met hem en zijn nederlandse echtgenote gr bloedjes zo behielden we ons aanlegplekje dicht bij de stad en het uitgaansleven van paramaribo
127800 de mensen daar hadden nog nooit een zeilboot gezien soms schrokken inlandse tegenliggers zo dat ze hun korjalen regelrecht de kant instuurden
127801 als we in suriname zijn zijn we s zondags te vinden in de hervormde kerk daar
127802 in 1997 stuurden we een oud sleepbootje vol boeken naar suriname
127803 het maritiem museum van suriname werd uiteindelijk zelfs vernoemd naar onze flying fish
127804 ik heb er precies hetzelfde voor gebeurd als wat het schip me ooit heeft gekost
127805 de lol was eraf in suriname willen ze snelle speedboten en niet een verbouwd slepertje
127806 a pretext for some to live off the work done by others
127807 from each according to his ability to each according to his needs
127808 equality does not mean egalitarianism this in the end is another form of exploitation that of the exploitation of the responsible worker by the one who is not or even worse by the slothful
127809 people are working less this is a reality that you can confirm in any corner of the nation pardon the bluntness of my words
127810 we must get used to receiving not only good news we are aware of the great number of problems waiting to be solved most of which weigh heavily and directly on the population
127811 giving comprehensible and appropriate information about survival benefit is extremely difficult in addition the reluctance to inform patients of the limited survival gain of palliative chemotherapy may be motivated by a desire to protect patients from bad news
127812 however the reluctance to address these difficulties and sensitivities may be hampering patients ability to make informed decisions about their future treatment
127813 the figure is still quite impressive and i estimate this will rise substantially in the next few years
127814 even pelosis own california neighbors oppose her efforts to block new drilling far off american coasts
127815 i will not give the administration an excuse for its failure
127816 im not going to be diverted for a political tactic from a course of action that has a big picture view a vision about an energy independent future that reduces our dependence on fossil fuels and focuses on those renewables that are protective of the environment
127817 a solid majority of americans want us to have more drilling for more american made energy and they arent going to take no for an answer
127818 speaker pelosi senators harry reid and barack obama are defying the will of the american people and theyre doing so at their own risk
127819 republicans feel like they have an opening because of the gas price issue to push for domestic drilling but we havent seen any empirical evidence or tangible evidence that its hurting democrats
127820 maybe this fall the issue will develop into a republican advantage but i dont see that were there yet
127821 its a battle of messages between the two parties more than an anvil around the necks of democrats
127822 if youre going to act like an ass dont be surprised if people ride you
127823 its your life its what you make yourself to be
127824 chances are you will never experience this again in your life

127953 last weekend dave had just about had enough of his neighbor for one lifetime so he figures hes going to do something about it he gets up at about four a m and goes to the kitchen for a jar of skippy out he creeps onto her lawn and leaves a big dollop of peanut butter on the grass then goes back to bed
127954 at his usual time dave takes belle out for a walk and deliberately cuts across his neighbors lawn which brings her out on the front porch shouting at him that his dog left another mess in her yard

128015 the performance of our customer facing businesses remains robust but our financial results have been significantly affected by treasury losses in the first four months of the year and by high funding costs

128093 we have three main features in the cryostasis mental echo thermodynamics and off course the game scenario
128094 the story of the game can be called linear but there are many variants of playing from one point to another and many time travel moments the mental echoes the endings of the game are multiple there is also a sophisticated psychological dilemma in it and we hope each player will find a solution suitable for him personally
128095 with the help of mental echo players can travel into the past of the ship and find out what really happened there and the reasons for the catastrophe in this way cryostasis sleep of reason is more like an unusual detective story with an ability for the reader or in our case the player to interfere the course of actions in the past and change the situation in future the main task of our team was to create a game in which this ability is perceived as something integral
128096 the system of mental echo is not exactly a memory travel
128097 the hero not only revises the moments of the other characters life he actually travels to the past of that person settles in his mind and operates his body mental characters are people who made some mistakes when they were still alive with mental echo our hero gets a chance to correct their mistakes and set them free off course if one travelled to the mental echo and prevented some mistake or destruction there will be no consequences of this disaster when he returns to reality in this way we can not only save the whole ship but also return life to every living being on board

128110 well i have been reading it and i want to thank you for the many good tips it is really a great book
128111 one of the biggest problems i see in educational software is that it overloads the learner we know from studies that humans can focus on only a few things at any one time so its important to keep graphics simple and concise

128114 kylies got x appeal kylie minogue wowed thousands of fans at londons o2 arena last night on the final leg of her kyliex2008 european tour belting out a string of her catalogue of hits as well as new material from her album x she proved she is still as popular as ever the singer who overcame breast cancer in 2005 and was recently voted one of the music industrys most innovative performers said prior to starting her tour that audiences would be given a fresh exhilarating act her website promised fans the new show will be a totally different concept o2 bosses are so impressed they want her back for more gigs
128115 serene and exalted kylie sailed through the first of seven nights at the o2 arena her 10th album x has now achieved platinum status in britain and has sold a respectable million copies worldwide meanwhile the kyliex2008 tour which opened almost three months ago in paris has journeyed through 21 countries to general acclaim and buoyant ticket sales with health scares well behind her not even turning 40 has made the slightest dent in her progress as a production this show certainly takes some beating from the moment that kylie first appeared floating high above the stage to the final flourish of i should be so lucky delivered to an audience engulfed in golden confetti and gaily coloured balloons the cast of acrobat dancers musicians and behind the scenes technicians never missed a trick
128116 kylies x rated show is pop perfection the grand canyon the pyramids uluru and then theres kylie her showgirl tour in 2006 all feather and sequin folly was small fry the kyliex show is pure astounding breathtaking spectacle kylie effortlessly instantly melted 20 000 hearts barely five minutes in the o2 was already scraping pop heaven
128117 falling in love with kylie all over again the show is pretty near faultless she can really sing for the encore its the new single the one im the one love me and you know what she actually is and we really do
128118 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
128119 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
128120 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
128121 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
128122 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
128123 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
128124 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
128125 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
128126 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
128127 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
128128 lets get free strategies for organizing the hip hop voting bloc
128129 before a lot of the songs about barack were supporting his campaign
128130 this song is different in that it almost claims the victory thats scary for some people who dont want to see that happen

128134 currently we do not have a fab expansion plan in china
128135 aside from the he jian stake we have no other plans to invest in china
128136 we have already agreed in principle on a number of important details for example with respect to the timeframe capacity profile and transfer price principles that will apply once we have reached a final agreement on dissolving the joint venture
128137 we have also agreed on a framework for arriving at a final decision on inoteras future ownership but this is all that we can comment on now
128138 i am absolutely determined with everything ive ever done in my life to see it through and i will lead us through to the next election
128139 i said to him that i expect he will announce his future plans when he is ready to do so
128140 when i look back at peters career hes never had the balls to challenge or make a move or actually move to get the job in circumstances where he could have got it
128141 im not saying he cant come back but the polls still say hes largely unelectable
128142 hes got a long way to go and there are a number of people in the party that have ambition
128143 there are plenty who will have a go at the right time so i dont think its going to be an easy passage for peter whenever and im not sure that hell ever be drafted
128144 in that sense hes going to have to move something he hasnt characteristically done in his entire career
128145 people have said to me from the day that i took this job they said look its the worst job in australia in politics
128146 but if i listened to commentators instead of doing what i think is right then id be losing objectivity
128147 brendan nelson is our leader he has the support of the party room and beyond that i make a golden rule of not commenting on leadership questions
128148 of course he said earlier in the year he was going to retire from politics
128149 its only inevitable that people from different countries and regions of the world dont see eye to eye on certain issues
128150 i dont think politicising the olympic games will do any good to address these issues
128151 it runs counter to the olympic spirit and also to the shared aspirations of the people of the world
128152 as always we will continue to provide facilities for foreign journalists coming to china to report
128153 of course we also hope the foreign reporters will abide by chinese laws and regulations
128154 we also hope you will provide objective reports of what you see here
128155 the implication is that foreign journalists should refrain from reporting stories that the government finds critical

128168 hanyasanya yang layak memakmurkan menghidupkan masjid masjid allah itu ialah orang orang yang beriman kepada allah dan hari akhirat serta mendirikan sembahyang dan menunaikan zakat dan tidak takut melainkan kepada allah dengan adanya sifat sifat yang tersebut maka adalah diharapkan mereka menjadi dari golongan yang mendapat petunjuk
128169 dan siapakah yang lebih zalim daripada orang orang yang menyekat dan menghalangi dari menggunakan masjid masjid allah untuk sembahyang dan menyebut nama allah di dalamnya dan ia berusaha pula untuk meruntuhkan masjid masjid itu orang orang yang demikian tidak sepatunya masuk ke dalam masjid masjid itu melainkan dengan rasa penuh hormat dan takut kepada allah bukan secara apa mereka lakukan itu mereka dengan perbuatan itu akan beroleh kehinaan di dunia dan di akhirat kelak mereka mendapat azab seksa yang amat besar
128170 sebelum kedua kedua kaki anak adam manusia tergelincir untuk dimasukkan dalam syurga atau pun neraka maka dia akan ditanya dengan empat perkara waktu remajanya apa yang telah dia habiskan seluruh umurnya apa yang telah dibuat untuk kebaikan dirinya tentang hartanya daripada mana sumber ia diperolehi dan bagaimana pula ia dibelanjakan tentang ilmunya apa yang telah dia lakukan

128175 but when you lose a couple it puts some extra emphasis on this particular test and i think thats pretty obvious
128176 since the involvement of this group of coaches weve only lost once two test matches in a row so that puts a bit of extra edge on it a bit of extra stress id imagine
128177 theres always a lot of tension every test match that youre involved in particularly the big ones
128178 thats the way it should be i guess i think most people would go through that tension
128179 were very focused to do the best job we can i think people are doing that the teams doing that and thats all we can do
128180 weve just got to make sure that we remain focused on doing that and dont get our attention on other things that dont matter
128181 as to whether were going to be good enough we cant do any more than were doing
128182 looking on from last week theres definitely a few things you can see that perhaps are a little bit familiar
128183 but every time you watch the wallabies they do what they do pretty well and there was another example of that last weekend

128213 they were the ideal three out of a number of famous cardiffians who have been through the eisteddfod
128214 it was a process of about eight or nine days to track them down matthew was the first to say yes then ioan and gethin
128215 i went to television centre in london to film with gethin still unsure if i could get a visa for america and that ioan and matthew were available for a days filming
128216 but i got the nod so off i went to la and with the help of a british man living there got hold of this fantastic house with stunning views to film
128217 there are a few different versions depending on the medium radio tv or online
128218 weve also done them for during the eisteddfod week when theyll be referring to particular things like the crowning and chairing ceremonies
128219 this is what i wanted but wasnt sure if i could get it its not often you get what you first wanted
128220 im very happy with the result and have had fantastic reviews and the promos have had so much coverage
128221 a file that is required to run search companion cannot be found you may need to run setup
128222 were here now we have the picnic and all its not great but were going to make the most of it the girls have been cooped up for long enough if its any way fine at all we are determined to get out and about you just have to get on with it
128223 it was a spur of the moment thing we rang round and jumped in the car were here now so we have to make the most of it im trying to be optimistic maybe itll get better later hopefully
128224 well we have the jackets and long trousers on but were going to build a few sandcastles now anyway and well see after that
128225 what can you do it could be pouring down next week weve been here all last week and as long as it stays any way dry at all well keep coming its not great weather but you have to try and make the most of it and the kids dont care they are having a ball
128226 the weekends are always very busy people arent real ly put off by the weather if they want to come theyll come regardless
128227 regional airports are convenient and practical and this building has served its purpose well as passenger numbers grow we will have an extension that will be both modern and practical
128228 well have to look at it and see if they can make it viable well show up there if the costs are low enough
128229 while i remain committed to seeing the full range of cancer services provided at a single centre of excellence in waterford regional hospital the agreement in february 2007 between the hse and upmc whitfield cancer centre at least spelt the end of the terribly unfair situation where public patients requiring radiotherapy had to travel for their treatment while those with health insurance were treated nearer home at whit field
128230 however i now under stand that there is still very real inequity at work in that pet ct which is the most advanced imaging technology available is in use at whit field for private patients who have or may have cancer but the hse is not funding public patients to access this very precise scanning that assists with detecting the spread of cancer and how treatment is being responded to
128231 the phrase medical apartheid was used to describe the situation when public patients could not access radiotherapy in the southeast
128232 it seems that a form of this institutionalised unfairness is continuing at present
128233 some of the benefits that patients receive from pet ct scanning include reduced scanning time improved detection of tumours better measurement of response to therapy improved therapy planning and more precise staging of the disease
128234 given this it is absolutely imperative that all patients who require such scanning have access to it at the nearest available location this cant be decided by the lottery of whether they do or dont have medical insurance
128235 we are fortunate to have a world leader in cancer care like upmc cancer centres providing services in the southeast and it baffles me why the hse apparently cannot reach an agreement allowing public patients access pet ct at whitfield at least until such a time as it is available at waterford regional hospital
128236 there is a growing awareness of waterford as a result of spraoi which has become a national brand
128237 the allocations build upon the excellent work of previous rounds of the programme and continue to support dedicated community spirit and reward local volunteerism every pitch that is laid every changing room that is built and every piece of sport equipment bought will allow more people to take part in a huge range of sports and help them to achieve their full potential in their chosen sport
128238 i work full time so whatever i earn is taxed at the top rate i sat down and worked it out last year and i think after i took into account everything like tax phone internet stationary travel there was about 7 000 leftover as a wage so whether people think that that is value for money i suppose theyll decide next year at election time
128239 theres a 7 000 allowance for each councillor for conferences every year now that is a lot of money it is our party policy not to attend conferences because it is well known that some people simply use this as a money making racket im not saying any waterford county councillor is guilty of this but the system is open to widespread abuse
128240 the bottom line is it is public money so the public are entitled to know where and how it is being spent my personal situation is that i job share im a teacher so i dont feel i could do the two jobs on a full time basis to the best of my ability so the salary i get as a councillor compensates for the decrease i took in my teaching job as a result of making that decision
128241 i know myself the time it takes going down meeting people in estates listening to them following up on a something getting the relevant person to talk to in the council there is also often a confidential element to the job where someone might be looking for help and advice in relation to a medical card or housing or something which obviously you are not going to be publicising
128242 the basic salary for a councillor is 16 000 then there is an additional allowance for expenses of around 100 a week if you are a chair of an spc then there is another allowance of around 4000 there are also payments for roles like chairing the vec or the southern health forum
128243 i will of course get the mayoral salary for the second half of this year and the beginning of next year which i think is around 32 000 and you also get a mayoral allowance of 10 000 which is quite an amount but whenever i have a mayoral duty to perform and there are a lot i get a locum into the surgery so i suppose it will probably cost me overall but it is an honour that im delighted to have
128244 it is such a novel use of the courthouse our members were very well disposed to supporting spraoi to stage the show
128245 its a beautiful building set in beautiful grounds and we are delighted to see it used by the public to enjoy the arts my fellow solicitors are particularly excited to have a building so closely associated with our profession highlighted in a positive way
128246 with obesity in irish children rising at alarming rates we all have a role to play in encouraging healthy food options and help reduce obesity among young people

128248 this crossing has been the scene of several bad accidents in recent times and following a particular bad accident i met with the residents of the area who expressed their concerns to me following that meeting i tabled a motion at city council asking for traffic lights and a pedestrian crossing to be put in place at this junction i also met with senior engineer frank roche and the gardai regarding this issue
128249 roadstone is among the largest building materials suppliers in the waterford region as such we naturally saw a link between ourselves and simon who are synonymous with providing shelter to those in need in ireland this successful relationship has helped our ongoing focus on workplace safety and in doing so generated a significant amount of much needed funding for galway simon community projects
128250 the crh safety challenge is an excellent example of partnership in action both between the business community and the local simon community this sizable donation comes at a critical time with budget cuts and the economic downturn and will assist us in our mission to prevent homelessness in waterford to alleviate some of the associated difficulties and to support people in moving towards independent living we commend crh and their membership organisations for their initiative and this innovative approach in addressing corporate social responsibility

128347 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

128350 this years crop of peanuts has been in the ground for weeks and 2008 production contracts were signed months ago changing the loan differential formula after the peanut crop has been planted would have been detrimental for our growers domestic demand for peanuts and peanut products has increased and the federal government should allow growers to respond to this demand without interrupting current systems in place i applaud usda for recognizing the importance of maintaining the historically recognized practice of establishing loan differentials for the 2008 crop year

128361 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
128362 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
128363 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
128364 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
128365 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
128366 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
128367 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
128368 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
128369 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
128370 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
128371 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
128372 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
128373 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
128374 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
128375 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
128376 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
128377 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
128378 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
128379 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
128380 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
128381 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
128382 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
128383 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
128384 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
128385 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
128386 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
128387 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
128388 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
128389 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
128390 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
128391 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
128392 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
128393 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
128394 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
128395 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
128396 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
128397 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
128398 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
128399 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
128400 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
128401 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
128402 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
128403 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
128404 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
128405 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
128406 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
128407 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
128408 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
128409 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
128410 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
128411 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
128412 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
128413 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
128414 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
128415 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
128416 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
128417 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
128418 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
128419 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
128420 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
128421 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
128422 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
128423 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
128424 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
128425 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
128426 who are open to doing something on the production side
128427 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
128428 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
128429 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
128430 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
128431 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
128432 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
128433 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
128434 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
128435 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
128436 high society how substance abuse ravages america and what to do about it

128484 we are delighted to support the city of houston with this new agreement
128485 this ela will eliminate time consuming efforts to secure critical gis software and instead will allow the city to focus on achieving its vision of an organization wide gis to better serve citizens and staff

128525 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
128526 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
128527 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
128528 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
128529 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
128530 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
128531 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
128532 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
128533 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
128534 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
128535 lets get free strategies for organizing the hip hop voting bloc

128566 by initiating the indo us nuclear deal the americans are aiming at making india a strategic ally and the us pressure was responsible for a deliberate delay in giving effect to the proposed iran pakistan india gas pipeline
128567 the us wants india to be its military base where the american planes can refuel after bombing in iraq and the soldiers can have recreation
128568 all we want is to protect the sovereignty of people of india and expose the upa governments hidden agenda of linking the countrys foreign policy to the us strategy

128572 unexpressed concerns are challenging because they can lead to different expectations and understanding of the problems patients are concerned about and treatment recommendations that are poorly tailored to patient needs
128573 physicians will have little chance to correct or modify them unfortunately unexpressed concerns may contribute to breakdowns in communication which are frustrating for both physicians and patients
128574 knowing that older adults frequently dont voice all their concerns should help surgeons create opportunities for patients who are reluctant to bring them up
128575 as duas escolas concorriam muito internamente mas percebemos que isoladamente num mercado cada vez mais competitivo eram relativamente fr geis

128580 the air pollutants of most concern for athletes and spectators alike are high levels of ozone and particulate matter both pollutants pose known respiratory hazards
128581 air quality in beijing in the summertime is dictated by meteorology and topography typically temperatures are high humidity is high wind speeds are low and the surrounding hills restrict venting of pollution
128582 the market is selling off because of the weak economic numbers out of the u s
128583 growth and oil demand is slowing in the u s europe and japan and its too optimistic to think will compensate for that
128584 prices will likely correct over the next six months to the 100 to 110 range
128585 there arent enough fundamental factors right now pushing prices higher
128586 im willing and ready to admit that im in pain every day its pretty terrible to be honest with you
128587 but i am here i am speaking with you im very fortunate and there are some that arent as fortunate as i and others that had no fortune that day
128588 its the type of thing we spend our careers trying to make sure does not occur
128589 that is not something you would want to leave to somebody else to have to pick up
128590 the bridge did collapse while i was the state bridge engineer so i feel i need to deal with it
128591 daily we spend time dealing with the aftermath of i 35w im not complaining
128592 im not going to tell you that weve never seen a political investigation here before
128593 but this one did have a good deal of political interest and outcry why this was a very highly visible event of incredible magnitude bridges dont fall in the united states its rare that they do very rare
128594 but we do not engage in politics we are not influenced by politics
128595 we are not protecting the governors butt any longer this has got to be done
128596 you can only fiddle with this stuff so long people dont like increases in taxes i dont but i dont know how else to pay for that
128597 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
128598 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
128599 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
128600 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
128601 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
128602 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
128603 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
128604 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
128605 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
128606 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
128607 lets get free strategies for organizing the hip hop voting bloc
128608 before a lot of the songs about barack were supporting his campaign
128609 this song is different in that it almost claims the victory thats scary for some people who dont want to see that happen
128610 there is a community of people who arent watching cnn or reading
128611 this is not a complex case it should be one that moves quickly
128612 i am looking forward to this trial as a way of finally showing the truth that im innocent
128613 but ive never had a situation with a general election coming 98 days after an indictment
128614 the strategy is simple hes counting on the fact that the government doesnt have its ducks in a row
128615 you force their hand because its not a small thing to put together a trial of such magnitude in eight weeks
128616 president clinton and a veteran of politically charged investigations said stevens is doing his best to seize control of a bad situation mid campaign has boldly demonstrated he believes he is innocent
128617 the prosecutors will be under great pressure after all this to prove their case
128618 some defense cases improve with age this isnt likely to be one of them
128619 people of alaska have hired him to bring money back to this state
128620 he has done that over and over and over again whatever these charges are he deserves the respect and our admiration we should wait to see what actually happens before theres a call to do anything
128621 if its not saturday but next week well not make a big fuss about it what matters is to get a clear answer quickly in the very coming days
128622 we are continuing our double approach of dialogue and pressure if dialogue does not work we could continue with additional pressure at the u n or eu level
128623 at 12 10am on wednesday we received a third party allegation that a photographer had been spat at by an individual outside a restaurant in hanway street w1
128624 officers established the incident occurred at approximately 10 20pm on tuesday evening
128625 the alleged suspect a 22 year old male was spoken to by police
128626 i was sitting in my chair thinking about that man when it happened i suddenly became aware of a voice speaking to me and i knew that it was real and that it was god i fell to my knees and prayed for the first time and it felt incredible ive taken every drug there is but the feeling i had that night was the best i have ever felt
128627 because of my background im able to break all the illusions surrounding gangsterism
128628 there is a really palpable glorification of the gangster ethos and i try to break that by telling people there is simply no pleasure or grace in violence
128629 our children are obsessed with the glamour of the gangster lifestyle but when you are beating someone who is screaming for mercy i can tell you theres not a lot of glamour in that
128630 youre working with pimps and prostitutes bathing homeless guys helping out in the crack dens you name it
128631 its a mixed bunch of people who have signed up to five years service one of them is a nurse shes never done anything bad in her life
128632 some kids can deal with those sorts of situation well but i didnt
128633 i fell apart and that day made a conscious decision not to love any more
128634 when they let me out i was like a caged animal that had suddenly been released it wasnt long before i found my natural calling
128635 i fell in with a crowd of guys who in my eyes had everything
128636 they ran huge drug importing businesses protection rackets and most of the west end nightclubs my first job was to go down to dover pick up a land rover from a car park and take it back to london they paid me five grand for that single job i knew it wasnt exactly mars bars in the back of that trunk but what did i care
128637 id be sitting on my sofa watching little house on the prairie with tears streaming down my cheeks later that afternoon i might have been practically beating someone to death it was like the two sides of me never met
128638 i drove away from that beating and i realised that i felt nothing no emotion whatsoever that in turn made me start asking myself what exactly i had become
128639 on the outside it looked like a glamorous way to live i had the penthouse flat the girls the sex and the sports car all the things kids today long for but i was utterly empty inside
128640 he had no need to do it but he believed me
128641 i suspect letting me go was something of an insurance policy a way of having something to show for himself just in case he needed to explain himself to the man upstairs
128642 i suppose my work now is partly driven by a desire to atone for my previous sins
128643 that was certainly very much the impetus in the early days but the more you preach and spread the word the more you learn to love it it becomes a joy to do
128644 i tell them that if you carry a knife you will either use it on someone or have one used on you kids talk to me about protecting themselves with knives but if youre not in a gang then you dont need the protection in the first place

128647 the decision on his release will be read before him that day it will be signed by the director of the prison
128648 we have sent his file to the provincial external relations office and relevant police offices
128649 rather we are blessed with having an incredibly supportive record label in wichita and they are as excited about such freedom frivolities and spontaneity in releases as we are 2 they said in a statement
128650 business people who think they can bribe their way into contracts with school systems and government agencies face the risk of being caught and convicted
128651 we have decided to move forward with a number of our productions and address any issues later as they arise
128652 everyone is working under the assumption that nothing will happen until there is an election and the results are known
128653 i think sag thought lets drag this into july and august lets force the studios to make a mistake maybe theyll impose maybe theyll lock us out and that will galvanize the members and then well get a strike vote that didnt happen

128699 it is a massive disappointment because the opportunity was there
128700 we got off to a great start but the penalty miss was a big turning point
128701 after that i thought we controlled the game to a certain extent and had some very good chances which we didnt convert and at any level if you dont take chances it comes back to haunt you
128702 the two goals were sloppy but at the end of the day we had a great opportunity to progress and we didnt take it and the boys know that
128703 they were happy to hit us on the counter attack and we struggled to come to terms with the change in their tactics and how to break they system down which was to try and get the ball wide but we didnt do that enough
128704 overall we had the chances and that is the most disappointing thing now we have to forget
128705 we cant sit moping around and feel sorry for ourselves we have to move on and think about the bigger picture which in my eyes is always the league championship

128709 the meeting will also determine the dates to issue the writ and notices to pave the way for the by election as well as to decide on which electoral roll to be used
128710 this is a place that would afford him the best chance to win so we will leave it to the permatang pauh voters to decide we will try our best
128711 the allegation against him was made by his own staff not the government
128712 but we accept his decision and we will face it anything can happen in a by election

128715 there is still a lot of anger and frustration among shareholders right now
128716 i havent spoken to anyone who thinks hey this is the right team to lead yahoo
128717 i hope there will be enough shareholder pressure at this meeting for the board to realize they need to bring in someone else to run the company
128718 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship

128736 we are very content with the results for the second quarter where our core profits have risen by nearly 20 for the second consecutive quarter as a result of our strategy and the initiatives we have adopted since q4 2007 the bank has shown great resilience in a challenging market environment we have continued to successfully increase our core income and profits while at the same time focusing on several cost cutting initiatives we estimate that these co ordinated efforts will start to bear real fruit in the second half of the year during the first half we have successfully raised eur 2 4 bn in funding while paying outstanding maturities of eur 2 1 bn at the same time we have maintained a strong cad ratio of 11 2 despite a severe weakening of the isk we have also been successful in deleveraging our balance sheet the banks liquidity position remains strong at eur 8 1 bn at the end of the quarter the bank launched a new international deposit product save amp save in norway and iceland which will be expanded into other markets in due course looking forward we will continue to focus on our core operations leveraging on the banks niche strategy and the positive outlook for the global food and energy sectors where we have a strong market presence in our immediate plans we do not expect the wholesale funding markets to improve in the near future with our strong asset quality intact we will continue to manage our balance sheet further diversifying our funding sources and deleveraging non core assets
128737 we do not accept virgin birth or partnership of two separate states
128738 the goal is for the united cypriot state as we know it and as it was established in 1960 to be transformed through the solution of the cyprus problem to a united federal bizonal bicommunal state as provided by the united nations resolutions and decisions
128739 besides this is what the two leaders agreed during the meetings that preceded their decision to begin direct negotiations namely the creation of federal bizonal bicommunal state with a single sovereignty a single citizenship and a single international personality
128740 the meeting of the president of the republic with mr downer took place in a very constructive spirit and gave the opportunity to the president to express and explain once again the positions of the greek cypriot side and i believe that having in mind mr downers statements as well these positions were understood
128741 the process of direct negotiations that will start in cyprus is not absolutely linked with the developments in turkey in the sense that the process is taking place in cyprus between the two communities
128742 we follow the situation in turkey and we are concerned about it taking into consideration that the key for the solution lies in turkey we all understand that the present political crisis in turkey and the outcome of this political crisis is undoubtedly of interest to us and a cause for concern
128743 now the reality is that conventional and strategic force modernization programs are strongly supported in the services and in the congress
128744 the principal challenge therefore is how to ensure that the capabilities gained and counterinsurgency lessons learned from iraq and afghanistan as well as the lessons we learned from other places where we have engaged in irregular warfare over the last two decades are institutionalized within the defense establishment
128745 looking to the future we need to find a long term place in the base budget for these lessons
128746 i firmly believe that in the years ahead our military is much more likely to engage in asymmetric conflict than conventional conflict against a rising state power
128747 we must be ready for both kinds of conflict and fund the capabilities to do both
128748 we do not accept virgin birth or partnership of two separate states
128749 the goal is for the united cypriot state as we know it and as it was established in 1960 to be transformed through

128757 why cant we share the wealth with these clubs and volunteer firehouses who use their money for charitable purposes
128758 we would charge a licensing fee of 1 000 for each machine up to five per club theyd be hard wired so wed be able to monitor each bet
128759 you think the gaming board and casino operators are going to let anyone in on their play
128760 the last thing i want to do is be a distraction here in the administration
128761 i think public service is important and i have really enjoyed what ive done
128762 if i decide to run and im the only contributor to my campaign i think id take that as a vote of no confidence from the rest of the voters
128763 he knows he shouldnt turn his back on the political establishment either
128764 he was a popular governor and nobody hates him people who are undecided might like to see somebody from their state get in
128765 they spend a lot of time focusing on themselves instead of the voters
128766 i say they should lower the jolly roger and raise the stars and stripes harrisburg needs an enema
128767 about a thousand feet unless somebody locks the gate at night
128768 we were involved we just couldnt get where they wanted to be and we couldnt get where we wanted to be so it was just one of those things
128769 we could please other clubs its just the fact that weve got to please ourselves a little bit we think we know what the value of those players are not only the players on one side of the fence but on our side of the fence you have to really evaluate that we just thought that maybe it was just a little bit too rich an ask for us
128770 i think at some point we had a good feeling about it
128771 i think its good for the game all of the attention
128772 ik ben opgetogen met de sterke en ervaren ploeg voor volgend jaar we zullen ons beste beentje voor zetten om een studentenstempel te drukken op de partijprogrammas voor de vlaamse verkiezingen 170 000 studenten in vlaanderen daar kan je niet omheen maar tegelijk willen we ook investeren in onze achterban de studentenraden van de 28 vlaamse hogescholen en universiteiten verdienen extra ondersteuning ook op internationaal vlak wordt het een spannend jaar net voor de ministeri le bolognaconferentie in leuven organiseert vvs de algemene vergadering van de europese studentenkoepel en vvs zelf viert dit jaar haar 70ste verjaardag

128784 national security is absolutely at the top of the list of issues thats why i think john mccain is the guy to keep us safe
128785 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
128786 this song is not only outrageously offensive to sen clinton rev jackson sen mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics

128793 im still kind of concerned about whats going to happen sunday because i know the horse went into the belmont in very good condition and whatever happened in that race i dont have an idea but if it happens again then im going to know something is wrong with him hes just not going to run anymore a whole lot depends on what happens sunday
128794 the breeders cup is definitely on top of the list even though you know this race here is more important than any race for him right now
128795 whatever happened in the belmont i dont feel that its my fault
128796 i dont feel i did anything wrong i know the horse went into the race very very good
128797 i was raising to thin the field and mix it up
128798 i didnt want to always limp in under the gun
128799 theres a good chance that my hands good but i had some short stacks behind me and i thought there was a good chance one of them might shove
128800 i think raymond has a small pocket pair he was in the blind and just the way he was acting i felt like if he had a 7 he wouldve tried to maximize it tried to check raise or lead out more i think he was trying to protect his underpair and didnt bet out enough when the guy on the button called i had no idea what he had
128801 you cant be scared because an overcard hits the board like that on the river because it wouldnt have made any sense for someone to be holding it at that point
128802 why would anybody have a 10 in their hand at that point and not have bet it earlier if it were a pair it doesnt fit the equation if it doesnt make sense then you need to maximize value and get a bet out there

128935 we once had a police service that despite sectarian conflict and horrific terrorism sought to keep itself free of political bias and partisan involvement not an easy task in a near civil war situation
128936 now we have a police command structure whose chief officer reportedly sits down to negotiate to do deals with those in possession of illegal arms with terrorists and with criminals
128937 i dont care which tradition these people come from disarmament is a political issue and no community should be left feeling that its chief constable and police service is compromised by involvement in a deal
128938 that was why we agreed to general de chastelains role in the decommissioning commission and the relevant legislation
128939 such indiscretion hasnt occurred before and neither i nor my colleagues can have any confidence in a psni command that is part of a deal beneficial or otherwise with those who live and act outside the law

128954 we support small shops too they are essential to the richness and diversity of london retailing but the mayor needs to think through all the implications of forcing any new obligation on developers
128955 with businesses already facing some of the toughest conditions in decades an obligation to provide units at below market rents could further undermine retail investment by making some developments unviable
128956 where small shops are struggling its down to a string of factors including restrictive leases upward only rent reviews parking charges and availability energy costs rates regulations and crime
128957 the mayor could help more retailers by turning his business summit words into action and tackling accessibility transport and disorder while encouraging the government to offer more effective business rates reductions to smaller retailers without imposing extra burdens on the rest
128958 during the election i promised to champion all sectors of londons business community and especially look out for the concerns of small businesses
128959 our small shops add real character and diversity to the capitals high streets but they are finding themselves squeezed out by competition from supermarkets and rising unsustainable rents
128960 my proposals aim to help reverse this trend offering small retailers the opportunity to make a success of their enterprise both by making more suitable premises available and taking steps to level the playing field by securing affordable rents

128976 it gives a good insight into glorious bits of music we thought should see light of day
128977 its a bit out of the norm a more beatless more abstract vein than were known for yet it also reflects the kind of soundtrack work we do for something like a tony scott film the idea for the mix came about when the combination of this great ryuichi sakamoto track featuring david sylvian with a remix of harry gregson williams score for man on fire just jelled we wanted to mix it up so that other peoples tracks become a bit of our own
128978 weve never actually played just one style so this is a real reflection of our dj sets of whats actually in our record box
128979 this mix isnt so much banging as it is a refined journey through todays clubbing experience a little bit progressive a little bit chunky and tech housey with some techno and breakbeat in the middle
128980 its our calling card but whether we use electronics string orchestras or brass our songs always take the listener somewhere which is where the cinematic tag comes from

128999 each year roughly 30 to 60 billion a year in taxpayer dollars is wasted because of medicare fraud and abuse this hurts not only taxpayers but medicare recipients and legitimate providers as a result congress should do everything in its power to eliminate fraud and abuse this legislation we are introducing moves our efforts from a pay and chase model to one that takes proactive tangible steps to stop fraud before it begins i hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this important effort to protect taxpayers and medicare recipients
129000 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
129001 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
129002 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
129003 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
129004 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
129005 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
129006 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
129007 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
129008 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
129009 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

129015 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
129016 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
129017 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
129018 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
129019 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
129020 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
129021 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
129022 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
129023 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
129024 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
129025 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
129026 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
129027 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
129028 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
129029 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
129030 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
129031 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
129032 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
129033 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
129034 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
129035 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
129036 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
129037 the regional fugitive task force is a program that works with local law enforcement to take the worst of the worst criminal offenders off the street florida is experiencing an increase in violent crime and this program is a priority
129038 this additional 10 million will help to expand the task forces presence in florida
129039 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
129040 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
129041 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
129042 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
129043 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
129044 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
129045 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
129046 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
129047 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
129048 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
129049 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
129050 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
129051 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
129052 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
129053 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
129054 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
129055 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
129056 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
129057 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
129058 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
129059 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

129062 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
129063 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
129064 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
129065 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
129066 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
129067 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
129068 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

129086 we started planting when the rains were supposed to come in march but then it never rained so all the seeds rotted
129087 my ox died because i couldnt feed it and now i cant plough this land quick enough to plant more maize i will have to sell everything off to buy food but then i dont know how i will feed everyone after that
129088 were worried what will happen if the rations go down any further
129089 this is the most desperate situation i have ever seen
129090 you can see that many people here are very ill from food shortages those most severely affected children are now getting help but the number of malnourished children is growing all the time and this is a real concern
129091 many babies have already died here and i think many more will die in the months to come not only children but also adults are becoming very weak nobody has anything to eat at all
129092 there have been vast improvements made here especially when you consider that this year we are facing a myriad of problems that is making the situation very difficult to handle
129093 its simple economics people dont have enough money to buy the food they need

129102 andrei is ready to move to tottenham now it just depends on zenit
129103 arshavin changed his decision about joining spurs due to excellent interest from spurs
129104 they are the one team that fully agreed his contract demands and ready to pay almost the full price that zenit wants
129105 juande ramos called andrei and described his vision of football and his vision of andreis future in the team
129106 ramos said that arshavin will be a key player of his team and he is highly interested in this deal
129107 spurs had the money for andrei all the time and their interest isnt new zenit doesnt want to say that they have official offer from tottenham but they have it
129108 i dont think the deal can be delayed until the super cup against manchester united because im unsure that todays arshavin can be useful for zenit
129109 i hope that zenit will collect themselves i know the high level of professionalism of zenits new president alexander dukov and his great personality
129110 we have certain contacts with tottenham but when they will conclude i still do not know
129111 i have received offers from england and spain but i am very calm
129112 i do because i played for another team last year and real madrid had to buy me back because i wasnt on loan
129113 im ready to prove my worth us youth system players are always asked to play for other teams in order to gain experience and i played a lot last season

129116 the levy will commence on august 18 and be used for educating the public on the dangers of alcohol abuse rehabilitation programmes for victims of alcohol abuse and other good causes
129117 it is further disheartening that government has unilaterally targeted a single industry with this huge development without providing any notice let alone consultation with the industry
129118 imposing a 70 percent levy is a sledge hammer approach that fails to take into account the complexity of consumption and trade in alcohol
129119 the au forces convoy was coming from the airport when it was targeted by a roadside bomb

129122 one of the vehicles was destroyed i saw au forces sealing off the area but i couldnt know how many people were hurt
129123 the united states abstained from the vote because language added to the resolution would send the wrong signal to sudanese president bashir and undermine efforts to bring him and others to justice
129124 no one will be immune from its catastrophic consequences the whole of sudan and the entire region
129125 how does it feel to have a hot poz load up you
129126 overall we are very happy with the result it was a team effort i commend the many victims and witnesses that came forward who had to recount some very private parts of their lives which they did in the public arena and should be commended

129132 our commitment to nuclear power is clear the go ahead for new nuclear power alongside our action to promote energy saving and renewables is in britains long term national interest
129133 the level of interest in nuclear new build remains high and recent months have shown there are strong signals of an appetite for this from the market

129137 in terms of the match it went pretty smoothly after he broke me back i won six games in a row to go 3 0 up in the second that was pleasing
129138 the humidity gets to your breathing a little bit obviously you sweat more which for me makes me feel a little bit more tired id just rather play in dry heat
129139 i dont know what to take out of this match
129140 what are you going to do i just tried to serve well theres always danger in tough matches against ivo i knew that from the start
129141 we can win the next election weve got to do that in two ways set out a very clear vision about how our values are right for the country and how we can take the country forward and set out the weaknesses in the conservative case
129142 for heavens sake lets get serious of course we can win with gordon as our leader
129143 we have got to stop sounding miserable about ourselves and sounding as if we have been treated unfairly we havent been treated unfairly
129144 we are not doing well enough its what the voters have said to us we have got to focus on how we can do better
129145 i think we are going through tough times i always feel that tough times do not last long but that tough people do i think gordon brown is a tough man

129170 stjerner har stor magt fordi det afg rende sp rgsm l i hollywood er hvem der spiller med i en film

129188 there is always the risk of the re emergence of a cyclical pattern as a generation of young people who have not experienced the actuality the horror and the cost of violence react against the ineffectiveness of politics and politicians their predecessors having been persuaded to turn away from violence on the promise that politics could deliver

129466 for applications where a maximum frame rate of 1 mhz is sufficient the cost of this type of camera would be less than half the cost of currently available systems
129467 we have developed an ultra high speed camera system that records microscopic images at higher resolutions than ever before
129468 such a camera could be used with picosecond lasers to image highly reflective objects at gigahertz rates something that has not been achieved to date
129469 this application necessitates frame rates from 100 khz to 20 mhz
129470 our camera can record four frame full resolution image sequences at frame rates up to 200 mhz and eight frame image sequences at frame rates up to 8 mhz
129471 our system can be configured in a variety of ways for different price performance points initial costs are lower as are operational and maintenance costs
129472 for applications where a maximum frame rate of 1 mhz is sufficient the cost of this type of camera would be less than half the cost of currently available systems
129473 there are no maintenance issues such as in rotating mirror and rotating drum systems for systems with a small number of frames the cameras can be drop in replacements for existing cameras for instance in microscopes

129528 it will be a slog for the economy for the next six to 12 months the recession may be over but it wont feel good until this time next year
129529 while we expect domestic demand to remain weak going forward stabilizing inventories will likely provide some positive offset in the second half of the year
129530 we have long held that the best measure of the economy most consumers interact with on a daily basis is final sales to domestic purchasers on this basis the economy has actually been weaker than it was in the last recession
129531 people will continue spending the stimulus checks in the third quarter and the fourth quarter that should encourage manufacturers and replenish those stocks
129532 executed very well it was very timely thats what these numbers tell me that in spite of the increases in energy prices
129533 the gdp revisions show the economy is continuing to operate at a level just slightly better than what we would see in an outright recession
129534 growth is narrowly focused however with most of the improvement coming from net exports
129535 the nuj will face a very tough financial period unless costs can be kept under control

129542 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
129543 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
129544 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
129545 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
129546 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
129547 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
129548 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
129549 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
129550 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
129551 lets get free strategies for organizing the hip hop voting bloc

129555 with this legislation we will install an impressive number of health care reforms
129556 we believe the compromise language adopted today by the conference committee could have grave consequences on both the future of clinical research in the state of massachusetts and patient health in general
129557 its not the absolute ban that we had started with but its a good middle ground
129558 we need to do something about transparency about eliminating inefficiencies in the health care system
129559 this bill will go a long way toward accomplishing that
129560 im willing and ready to admit that im in pain every day its pretty terrible to be honest with you
129561 but i am here i am speaking with you im very fortunate and there are some that arent as fortunate as i and others that had no fortune that day

129573 the alleged suspect a 22 year old male was spoken to by police
129574 euro strength and weak demand conditions weighed on new orders which contracted at a record pace
129575 anecdotal evidence suggested that a general deterioration in domestic demand combined with worsening export conditions led to the marked contraction of overall new orders
129576 at 42 8 the seasonally adjusted employment index signalled the second sharpest fall in staffing levels in the survey history
129577 there were reports that competitiveness in export markets had been damaged by the strength of the euro while firms also commented on general weakness in export demand particularly from the uk
129578 of the 53 per cent of firms that noted a rise in input costs many commented on higher oil prices while others mentioned increased metals costs
129579 pressured by substantial input cost inflation firms continued to increase their prices charged despite falling new order levels

129588 the last few races have been a little bit disappointing but the only way to move on is to keep working hard and eventually the results will come
129589 it isnt like climate change where you put carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and it lasts for decades air quality is a short term problem if you stop emitting your air quality could improve very quickly
129590 its about the rate at which you pump this stuff into the atmosphere and the meteorological conditions there is not too much you can do about the latter
129591 very very low winds high atmospheric pressure an anti cyclone building up above the city it acts like a saucepan with the lid on
129592 the weather conditions were unique the whole of londons pollution didnt go anywhere
129593 it is like taking a pan of soup off the hob it steams but put a lid on it and everything just sits under the lid
129594 particles emitted are much much smaller they are not as visible people feel safer but the real problem is that because they are smaller they get deep down into the lungs where the coal particles didnt get
129595 people who already have asthma more likely to have an asthma attack there is an impact on the number of hospital visits and there is an impact on mortality even at concentrations that many countries experience
129596 it put a lot of babies in hospital santiago has got a ring of mountains round it and a lot of vehicles they closed a lot of factories the smog went but i dont know how much one could ascribe it to the actions taken
129597 in normal day life you dont get given multiple choice questions to sit
129598 which is the space where we hold on to information if there are too many options it is hard to keep track of them and by the last option they have forgotten the first
129599 but shifting the focus up and down and from left to right required when answering a multiple choice question can lead them to read inaccurately especially if there are lots of possible answers
129600 it is like the piano it is frequently the worst musical instrument for dyslexics to learn
129601 for the vast majority of people it is a reasonable compensation because you cant take the whole range of adjustments into consideration and have to go with a rule of thumb
129602 its not about changing the whole system but putting in reasonable adjustments to create an even playing field
129603 is to have big chunks of time during the day when all youre doing is thinking
129604 we have to make sure that people in offices go out at lunchtimes
129605 if you leave your desk to wander up the street you come back refreshed and more able to work
129606 people dont take an hour off for lunch any more but you can eat in a quarter of an hour and then walk somewhere churches are great for this
129607 its good to get off the bus earlier and walk in london you can give yourself an hour of pure pleasure
129608 it could be a corner of the room or a dedicated meditation room
129609 ive asked people where they are physically when they have great ideas paradigm shifting epiphanies or a flood of memories theyve been trying to remember
129610 regardless of continent age gender education and race the answers are the same
129611 headphones help people remarkably you can shut out the distractions on public transport in a way that was impossible a generation ago
129612 podcasting allows people to make far more effective use of their travel what might have been dead time becomes valuable reflective time
129613 you can gain possession of a problem by writing about it and looking back over past issues to see how youve dealt with them that way you progress your learning as you go along
129614 its not a given that thought is a solitary rather than a social activity
129615 people you disagree with are what gets you going rather than idly going through an unchallenged stream of consciousness i think more clearly when im challenged
129616 theres a tendency in large organisations to keep us busy
129617 and when were not busy to distract us with a never ending stream of media like e mail facebook and tv
129618 i can say that all great creators without exception have taken breaks
129619 leonardo da vinci had a bed in his studio and when patrons accused him of wasting time he said if i dont do this you dont get the work
129620 you have to disconnect from what stops you thinking just stop the flow for a bit not to a hermetic extent you could unplug the tv or not get a daily paper for a few days
129621 is to have an understanding of the importance of thought thinking is what makes us human
129622 someone whos desperate to do something will find the time
129623 everyone can have an hours less sleep its staying alert thats the difficulty
129624 if you dont give the brain breaks it will take them
129625 in the form of loss of concentration or what we call a mental breakdown
129626 so much worse could happen but it makes you feel like youve been invaded someone is taking liberties on your property that you would never take with anyone else
129627 if youre just driving around you might not notice it
129628 content will be more important than its container in this next phase of the web killer apps such as search rss and video capture software such as tivo to name just a few have begun to unlock content from any vessel we try to put it in
129629 web 2 0 is about making the internet useful for computers
129630 the shift to utility computing is already remaking the computer industry bringing new competitors like google and salesforce com to the fore and threatening stalwarts like microsoft and dell but the effects will reach much further cheap utility supplied computing will ultimately change society as profoundly as cheap electricity did we can already see the early effects in the shift of control over media from institutions to individuals in debates over the value of privacy in the export of the jobs of knowledge workers even in the growing concentration of wealth as information utilities expand the changes will only broaden and their pace will only accelerate
129631 carr warns this trend could herald a new darker phase for the internet one where these mega networks could eventually operate as a fearsome entity that will dominate our lives he dubs it the world wide computer
129632 carr describes a world in which a handful of lucky and brilliant entrepreneurs uses the world wide computer to tap humanitys smarts and creativity for free la youtube and wikipedia while putting legions of information professionals out of work if thats not dreary enough he predicts that companies and governments will be able to harvest data from these networked computers to track our behavior and ultimately to control us
129633 the vast majority of todays enterprise applications owe their genesis to a period very different from today even the most apparently innovative share perhaps unnecessary heritage with their ancestors preventing them from fully exploiting the potential of an ever more connected world the increased ubiquity of high speed access to the internet has changed the lives of millions at the same time plummeting costs for storage computing and bandwidth have formed key aspects of the environmental shift that has enabled web based companies to entice users with significant free offerings and to subsequently monetise these in a variety of ways from the ever popular pro account to the universal fall back of advertising the web has become our water cooler our photo album our book shop our encyclopaedia our travel agent our road atlas and also fulfils a host of functions without commonplace offline forms inside the enterprise the internet remains at a remove from the applications within which most employees spend their time valid concerns around security are certainly a factor here as are the long lead times required to develop and implement new systems more serious though is an apparent lack of vision rather than fundamentally re engineering with what tim oreilly refers to as the internet inside new applications continue to repeat the methods and mindset of the past the capabilities of the network cloud beyond the corporate firewall remain woefully underused their potential unrealised
129634 trying to use the semantic web without sparql is like trying to use a relational database without sql
129635 a web service for running queries on structured data in real time this service works in close conjunction with amazon simple storage service amazon s3 and amazon elastic compute cloud amazon ec2 collectively providing the ability to store process and query data sets in the cloud
129636 hey if you live in the uk you will be able to access and begin your hulu experience but when you choose a show to stream youll be disappointed have a nice day
129637 so if only we could express these relationships such as my social graph in a way that is above the level of documents then we would get re use thats just what the graph does for us we have the technology it is semantic web technology starting with rdf owl and sparql not magic bullets but the tools which allow us to break free of the document layer if a social network site uses a common format for expressing that i know dan brickley then any other site or program when access is allowed can use that information to give me a better service un manacled to specific documents

129645 even though they all dodged a bullet some will be more traumatized than others
129646 at least if it was a professional hit the motives behind it would be known
129647 but the randomness of this attack means the passengers were thrust into danger without any answers
129648 this isnt like texas where an old lady can pull out a gun and defend herself these people had no warning or protection
129649 in the past there would often be mandatory de briefings after a serious incident where people such as the red cross would almost force people to talk about what happened and this generally proved non productive
129650 others will want to distance themselves as much as possible
129651 some people are very good at compartmentalizing their feelings the strong silent types
129652 some passengers will now feel helplessness so let them talk about it emotional energy gets topped up over time and some might have trouble sleeping
129653 he made time for small kids at the day care
129654 the most important mitigating factor is that miraculously none of your victims have tested positive
129655 im sorry for what i did i have taken many wrong choices in my life
129656 he had difficulty reconciling in his mind that he would be hiv positive for the rest of his life and he had difficulty understanding what that meant
129657 inflicting injury on himself was not conducive to the safety of those around him
129658 this particular incident as horrific as it is is obviously extremely rare certainly the horrific nature of it is probably one of a kind in canadian history
129659 i was saying to my grandmother this morning i hope there wont be any crazy people on there today
129660 ill sleep with one eye open now knowing what happened you never know who could get on a bus
129661 its a rare thing to happen so im not that worried about it
129662 people were in utter shock nobody expects this to happen at a funeral everybody was screaming several people were crying the police put him in a head lock and whipped him to the ground and jumped on him
129663 i think its just disgusting they did it in front of young kids and mourners our hearts go out to the man who was assaulted in london and his family but this wasnt right ive got a lot of respect for the police and what they do but not this
129664 i have a responsibility to protect my officers and the public
129665 we let him attend the funeral but we felt the best place to make the arrest was before he got in a car because we didnt want to have a pursuit yes we probably offended some people but we might also have protected someone else from getting hurt
129666 weve seen this happen but not necessarily in that fashion its been discreet the police have their job to do and i just have to assume the circumstances were different the timing wasnt the greatest
129667 a young fella got out of the car and came down and assaulted myself and moyle district councillor padraig mcshane
129668 this has been carried out by anti social elements within the area people should be standing up to these people and we will be doing the same
129669 at around 13 50 we received a call to dunclug park about an assault on two members of sinn fein
129670 police believe the incident was a reaction by a small number of people in the area to a multi agency approach to the removal of bonfire material
129671 this is our level but we want to show we are the best side just the same
129672 i know people knock the murphy cup but it has provided us with competitive games lately were back at croke park and its a day out for our fans
129673 there are no hiding places at croke park everyone knows that we are in the spotlight and we want to do ourselves justice
129674 oh dont worry you wont get them any time soon
129675 everybody is just numb totally shocked by the accident its terrible news
129676 he used to run around splashing water climbing trees running into peoples houses around here and stealing ice cubes but that was just him he loved rainbows and all the colours in them
129677 he used to say to me that at the end of the rainbow is happiness
129678 we once had a police service that despite sectarian conflict and horrific terrorism sought to keep itself free of political bias and partisan involvement not an easy task in a near civil war situation
129679 now we have a police command structure whose chief officer reportedly sits down to negotiate to do deals with those in possession of illegal arms with terrorists and with criminals
129680 i dont care which tradition these people come from disarmament is a political issue and no community should be left feeling that its chief constable and police service is compromised by involvement in a deal
129681 that was why we agreed to general de chastelains role in the decommissioning commission and the relevant legislation
129682 such indiscretion hasnt occurred before and neither i nor my colleagues can have any confidence in a psni command that is part of a deal beneficial or otherwise with those who live and act outside the law
129683 the police services record on dealing with loyalist paramilitaries and those involved in criminality is very clear it will not be tolerated
129684 it is a massive disappointment because the opportunity was there
129685 we got off to a great start but the penalty miss was a big turning point
129686 after that i thought we controlled the game to a certain extent and had some very good chances which we didnt convert and at any level if you dont take chances it comes back to haunt you
129687 the two goals were sloppy but at the end of the day we had a great opportunity to progress and we didnt take it and the boys know that
129688 they were happy to hit us on the counter attack and we struggled to come to terms with the change in their tactics and how to break they system down which was to try and get the ball wide but we didnt do that enough
129689 overall we had the chances and that is the most disappointing thing now we have to forget
129690 we cant sit moping around and feel sorry for ourselves we have to move on and think about the bigger picture which in my eyes is always the league championship
129691 the time commitment is a lot more than was expected and some of the original chairs have even had to appear before tribunals in their own time and with no payment
129692 i work for the college every day and there are many complex new initiatives coming into the further education sector which have to be dealt with
129693 it is not just about the number of meetings we have to attend
129694 i am hopeful that this issue will be resolved over the next few weeks before the start of the new academic year
129695 i think the department has so far taken advantage of the good will of the chairs
129696 i do hope the very committed men who resigned will reconsider their positions if the problems are sorted out
129697 i have listened to their frustrations and feel they have been treated poorly
129698 i understand that the minister is sympathetic but has to wait for this to be dealt with by the department of finance and personnel
129699 these people have given a lot of service to the colleges and have had a lot of responsibility so the department should not have been dragging its feet over this issue
129700 i made them in two halves and they were pressed in a hydraulic press theyre actually hollow
129701 i soldered them together with silver so you cant see the soldering
129702 he was the northern irish footballer who was born in 1908 and scored 44 goals between 1931 and 1932 he holds the record as the highest goal scorer in a season without penalties which apparently makes it better
129703 and the presentation of the piece to rangers will happen on august 18 which was sam englishs birthday its also my birthday so i was definitely the right silversmith
129704 i like the idea of it being functional not just hidden away and only used for special occasions
129705 eating off silver is very different i hope the ritual ceremony and preciousness enhance the users dining experience
129706 my dad michael mccrory and i share a workshop now and a couple of years back we had a joint exhibition with my mother deirdre called silver connections
129707 i suppose his work influenced me in terms of living in a creative background i was always sewing and making things from a child
129708 i love the fact that i can manipulate it take a flat sheet of metal and make it into the shape that i designed
129709 you start off with a flat disc then hammer it its a slow laborious process and when you look at a silver artefact every dimple represents a hammer mark and they mask thousands of other hammer marks
129710 its not a question of whoops ill throw that away
129711 i know what im doing and if i am making something using a 36cm disc worth 1 000 its got to work
129712 the police service is aware of speculation in the community about the identity of a suspect wanted for questioning about the murder of jean quigley in derry on saturday july 26 police are grateful to the community for the support and co operation they have received in this investigation
129713 the investigation is making significant progress and a number of definite lines of inquiry are being actively pursued police are also grateful to the media for their assistance in highlighting this case and carrying appeals for information
129714 but detectives are concerned that publicity surrounding any named individual will impede the progress of their investigation and may compromise the chances of a successful prosecution
129715 police efforts will not be assisted by untimely media coverage it is the psnis responsibility to bring an offender before the courts and collect evidence which will secure a successful conviction
129716 that is what detectives are working to achieve that is what jean quigleys family want and what the community wants
129717 detectives would ask media not to publish or broadcast any material about a named or identified suspect without prior agreement with psni
129718 how can i leave the presence of this gruesome entity

129756 that some sensitive sites would be blocked on the basis they were not considered games related
129757 no deal with the chinese authorities to censor the internet has ever in any way been entered into
129758 the issues were put on the table and the ioc requested that the olympic games hosts address them
129759 we understand that bocog will give details to the media very soon of how the matter has been addressed we trust them to keep their promise
129760 they have made a promise of free internet access and i think we should put pressure on the organizers to alter the decision
129761 not only do the governments monitors continue to filter hundreds of sites the press center for foreign journalists offers the same filtered version of the internet
129762 overseas media will be able to freely travel around china and enjoy uncensored access to the internet during the 2008 beijing olympics organizers promised on wednesday
129763 bocog media services head li jingbo said the internet service provided to news services at the games would be uncensored
129764 president bush has long said that china has nothing to fear from greater access to the internet or to the press or from more religious freedom and human freedom and human rights

129769 i think the reading fans appreciate his honesty on the pitch and also his honesty off it
129770 he said right from early on that he wanted to go elsewhere and play and his performances were never affected
129771 it would have been understandable if on occasion he would have ducked out of a few things but its not in his nature he is a whole hearted player and im sure we will see that tomorrow
129772 he tried things at chelsea and he said he enjoyed playing with all their top class players
129773 but now he wants to play more regularly and villa will give him that this is a good opportunity for him but its still going to be competitive he will have to really press for his chance
129774 im still in contact with a lot of the lads and considering the players they have in the squad and the way the club is run they deserve top flight football
129775 now the players have got to show a big enough character to come back up
129776 they need to get a positive mentality back so they have to start the season well
129777 they are up to speed because they have played in the qualifiers

129803 the prince was very pleased to see our selection of local organic meats he knew all about the red poll cattle and he was saying that they used to have a herd at sandringham when he was a boy which are now making a comeback on the estate he was pleased that suffolk cattle are now back in the area
129804 the pickles we gave to them are branded for the essex suffolk and norfolk army regiments and part of the money from each sale goes back to the regiments the prince was pleased to see our selection of local produce
129805 we normally charge 4 50 for a pound but we gave them a bag full for a fiver we were happy to look after them
129806 we are very content with the results for the second quarter where our core profits have risen by nearly 20 for the second consecutive quarter as a result of our strategy and the initiatives we have adopted since q4 2007 the bank has shown great resilience in a challenging market environment we have continued to successfully increase our core income and profits while at the same time focusing on several cost cutting initiatives we estimate that these co ordinated efforts will start to bear real fruit in the second half of the year during the first half we have successfully raised eur 2 4 bn in funding while paying outstanding maturities of eur 2 1 bn at the same time we have maintained a strong cad ratio of 11 2 despite a severe weakening of the isk we have also been successful in deleveraging our balance sheet the banks liquidity position remains strong at eur 8 1 bn at the end of the quarter the bank launched a new international deposit product save amp save in norway and iceland which will be expanded into other markets in due course looking forward we will continue to focus on our core operations leveraging on the banks niche strategy and the positive outlook for the global food and energy sectors where we have a strong market presence in our immediate plans we do not expect the wholesale funding markets to improve in the near future with our strong asset quality intact we will continue to manage our balance sheet further diversifying our funding sources and deleveraging non core assets
129807 as well as enabling efficiency gains to be realised across the group these proposals also mark a significant strategic shift in our publishing strategy
129808 the company remains totally committed to providing readers with highly relevant local content delivered in a range of print and digital formats when and where they want it and these proposals are consistent with this objective
129809 in the event that the proposals go ahead we will try to minimise the impact through voluntary redundancy and redeployment to alternative positions

129845 it is time for mayor mark begich to walk his talk in television and radio commercials and on his web site he says he will be open and transparent with his personal finances in good times and bad but his current financial disclosure forms dont add up
129846 the republican party was so quick to try and distract from its own issues they didnt even get their facts straight you cant ignore the irony of the politically motivated attack filed on the same day sen ted stevens is arraigned in federal court on seven felony counts related to accepting illegal gifts valued at over 250 000 from veco
129847 van with a couple of guys in it and they did a bunch of crummy work
129848 he just said a bunch of us are fixing up teds place a little bit and asked me if i could pick up my yard a little bit and stuff and make it a little nicer for ted you know because of all his years of service and stuff
129849 they were concerned to a person they dont want to see mark begich as the united states senator representing alaska
129850 before when ted was perceived to be the guy there wasnt a lot of interest now all of a sudden these groups are scrambling around to figure out how to be supportive
129851 that means stevens is rolling the dice thats for sure
129852 he and his lawyer surely think they can win the case
129853 my guess is hes going to come out swinging on the campaign trail
129854 for me the best way is hopefully he can talk about it now that the other shoe has dropped so to speak
129855 well im certainly not personally interested in filling that void and leaving my job as governor
129856 ask for any special favors because hes a senator and served 40 years in the senate
129857 hed like to clear his name before the election this is not a complex case it should be one that moves quickly
129858 the reason for your request is not an insignificant one
129859 i can appreciate why the senator would like to have this matter commence and concluded before the election
129860 i am humbled by all the outpouring of support expressions of friendship and offers of prayers
129861 this process has lasted for more than a year causing great distress to my family and confusing the alaskans who have put their trust in me for more than 40 years
129862 when all the facts come out at the trial alaskans will know that i continue to be a dedicated public servant and that i am working hard for them every day
129863 its generally understood up here that both allen and smith were engaged in a sting operation for approximately six months after they agreed to cooperate
129864 a whole lot of telephone calls were recorded when they were talking to public officials
129865 ive listened to every tape theyve produced and some of which involve people who are involved in the stevens case my take on it is that allen and smith were trying to set people up
129866 one of the jurors contacted us and told us the only thing that convicted vic was the last tape when vic said offhandedly to bill allen i wont vote on that if you dont want me to that was really the only thing that convicted vic
129867 im sure the prosecutors want to keep it in d c because everyone in alaska loves uncle ted
129868 i am pleased that the judge has set a speedy trial date which should allow ample time for a decision before the general election i am looking forward to this trial as a way of finally showing the truth that i am innocent
129869 we have a bill of rights and a trial by jury in our country to protect our citizens so that every person has their day in court
129870 i am humbled by all the outpouring of support expressions of friendship and offers of prayers this process has lasted for more than a year causing great distress to my family and confusing the alaskans who have put their trust in me for more than 40 years

129895 when i look back at peters career hes never had the balls to challenge or make a move or actually move to get the job in circumstances where he could have got it
129896 im not saying he cant come back but the polls still say hes largely unelectable
129897 hes got a long way to go and there are a number of people in the party that have ambition
129898 there are plenty who will have a go at the right time so i dont think its going to be an easy passage for peter whenever and im not sure that hell ever be drafted

129908 to facilitate international horse transfers sydney airport has installed an amenities block with showers in the ltf
129909 this enables aqis to ensure that staff who have come in contact with imported horses shower out prior to leaving the ltf

129911 ones competitive spirit is slightly piqued when someone else does well with a movie and you think why didnt we have that
