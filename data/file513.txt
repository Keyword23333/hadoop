5130113 some guys have been released at other places and people are picking them up youd like to pick up some of those guys and bring them in because theyve been in other camps and push some of our guys
5130114 unfortunately there are some guys right now on our roster that are borderline guys that as of today would make it just because we dont have anybody else
5130115 when guys are in the training room theyre not out here practicing youve got to be willing to release them and live with it and pick other people up for more competition
5130116 i spoke with him about that about this is a big game for him even though its a preseason game
5130117 its week 3 and hell play more than hes played in the first two and in the fourth game we dont play our starters hardly at all so its a big week for him
5130118 inconsistency drops weve got a long ways to go at that position
5130119 if they cant go were not going to push them to go and risk getting injured more
5130120 if theyre healthy to go i would consider kicking them in that fourth game

5130135 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5130136 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5130137 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5130138 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5130139 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5130140 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5130141 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5130142 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5130143 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad

5130152 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5130153 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5130154 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5130155 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5130156 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5130157 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5130158 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5130159 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5130160 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5130161 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5130162 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5130163 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5130164 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5130165 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5130166 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5130167 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5130168 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5130169 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5130170 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5130171 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5130172 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5130173 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5130174 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5130175 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5130176 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5130177 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5130178 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5130179 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5130180 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5130181 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5130182 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5130183 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5130184 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche

5130192 last week i landed in washington dc brimming with optimism upon arrival i was whisked into a separate room an american official informed me that he had just received information about me that he could not reveal however it required him to put me on the next plane home i was shocked and i was taken aback at the cruelty of snatching away my educational dreams at the last possible moment

5130203 never offend people with style when you can offend them with substance
5130204 why didnt you tell me you were doing a new version
5130205 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
5130206 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
5130207 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5130208 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5130209 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
5130210 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
5130211 we are hoping to get into patients within the next 12 months or so
5130212 we know at the moment in rat studies that our compound inhibited the development of fibrosis and the interesting thing in the future would be to see whether we can actually reverse fibrosis
5130213 currently we have some quite strong data showing that our compounds prevent fibrosis occurring
5130214 we have looked at it in a series of animal models that are very predictive of clinical outcomes hence the reason we are quite confident that our data is robust
5130215 a lot of the remodelling or the fibrosis that occurs in patients with heart attacks causes the heart to fail over the short term
5130216 if it was the first of its kind on the market it would be a huge step forward because there are currently no anti fibrotics on the market
5130217 obamas shifting stance on space exploration is indicative of his inexperience on issues important to voters
5130218 lets be honest obama is only embracing nasa now because of his political problems in florida
5130219 something that is elemental and a vital part of our space program
5130220 i think weve got to sort out our priorities better in other words we cant do everything
5130221 to maintain a robust program of human space exploration and continue our nations pre eminence in space
5130222 considering obamas shifting positions he cannot be trusted to fully support nasas mission to mars
5130223 the only thing barack obama knows about sending a man to the moon is that its a good applause line
5130224 for it is thou o lord who judgest me for although no man knows the things of a man save the spirit of the man which is in him yet there is something of man which the spirit of the man which is in him does not know itself but thou o lord who madest him knowest him completely and even i though in thy sight i despise myself and count myself but dust and ashes even i know something about thee which i do not know about myself and it is certain that now we see through a glass darkly not yet face to face therefore as long as i journey away from thee i am more present with myself than with thee i know that thou canst not suffer violence but i myself do not know what temptations i can resist and what i cannot but there is hope because thou art faithful and thou wilt not allow us to be tempted beyond our ability to resist but wilt with the temptation also make a way of escape that we may be able to bear it i would therefore confess what i know about myself i will also confess what i do not know about myself what i do know of myself i know from thy enlightening of me and what i do not know of myself i will continue not to know until the time when my darkness is as the noonday in thy sight
5130225 through perseverance in true prayer divine light and grace increase and these always make the soul grow deep in humility as it reads as it has been said the life of jesus christ god and man i cannot conceive anything greater than the manifestation of god and self but this discovery that is this manifestation of god and self is the lot only of those legitimate sons of god who have devoted themselves to true prayer
5130226 they want us to buy time so the main force can pull farther back
5130227 hey can anybody hear me how many of us are here were all going to die together well just be a line of corpses in the morning dont shut up now
5130228 i knew it was hopeless from the start headquarters didnt know what they were doing there was no way a strategy like that could work you know what im talking about dont you guys we had to lose its a total mess i wish to hell i had joined the other side then we could have gotten a mountain of cash for winning we could have drunk ourselves blind we could have had all the women we wanted i could have gone either way on this one but i picked the wrong side to fight on
5130229 listen you guys i dont know how many of you are out there but were all going to die in the morning or most of us maybe one or two will live to escape no more think about it those are lousy odds youve all been through this before youre veterans war heroes youre probably not scared but even so even if youre not scared dont you think this is stupid huh tell me youve been through a lot more battles than i have so tell me what the hell are we here for we dont hate the enemy we dont owe the leaders on our side anything but weve got to kill the enemy and follow our leaders orders and were still going to end up dead tell me you guys dont you think its pointless dont you think its stupid
5130230 all i wanted was some money and maybe something better to eat and maybe nicer clothes i would have been happy with that what a mistake i made taking work like this i never should have done it
5130231 i dont want to die here i tell you not now not here like a worthless dog
5130232 every once in awhile the moon comes out check your direction when that happens go straight toward the setting moon
5130233 its the only way you can get out of here
5130234 why you come too lets both escape come with me
5130235 what about you you want to live too dont you you should run away with me
5130236 get the hell out of here youre ruining it for the rest of us so why not run away
5130237 i will blot out the injustice which was created from the face of discrimination for we are sorry that this was the past
5130238 we have determined to make an end of all of this injustice
5130239 go and prepare you and all your households for we have seen that you are righteous before us in these generations 2 for we will send a flood of change upon the earth thirty days and thirty nights and every thing will change
5130240 go forth to the future you and yours and your sons and your sons husbands and your daughters and your daughters wives with you 12 bring forth with you every living thing that is with you that they may breed abundantly on the earth and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth
5130241 i will never again allow injustice in the land 17 while the earth remains seedtime and harvest cold and heat summer and winter day and night justice shall not cease

5130303 the patient must utilise the technology usefully in the correct perspective instead of dissection discussion and hair splitting
5130304 the internet which is very useful to most of us can supply ideas to the patient to gain knowledge to pose intelligent questions to the urologist and forget the actual purpose of the visit to the doctor
5130305 the urologist may have a tough time treating such patients successfully and satisfactorily
5130306 the way i look at it if you get something from a doctor you dont like you find a doctor that gives you better options i found another doctor who said id live seven to 20 years so i like that doctor better
5130307 ive missed two of the three games with richmond senior since andrew has been on the varsity
5130308 he tries to be involved as much as he can without being intrusive
5130309 i aspire to be as strong as him and tough in all areas of life
5130310 i knew it drove him crazy to be as uninvolved as he was just going to the games i was happy for him that hes found a way to get a little more satisfaction feeling a part of the team
5130311 he could play linebacker for us but hes sacrificed for the team to play offensive line
5130312 hes a little undersized to be a lineman 6 1 220 but hes tough as nails
5130313 i dont know what level of football he can play but he would be a valuable member of any team because hes that kind of kid
5130314 its important for our family as much as it is for the team
5130315 its a last chance to get a ring im just ready to get going
5130316 im just a dad whos kind of sick whos looking forward to watching his son play
5130317 they were the closest to us before the war and now they are the most frightening enemy

5130333 for a long time people kind of got use to going to the doctors and filing a claim now its like we want the whole bill upfront
5130334 we are like any other business we have to collect our money to pay our bills its far easier to collect upfront than to go after someone on the back end
5130335 its reasonable to go an eye doctor on monday and then visit other doctors on wednesday and thursday and there will be an overpayment
5130336 the doctor said well it looks like hes got all the symptoms of west nile virus
5130337 i called the state health department because i needed to know how long he was going to be sick
5130338 i was just bawling i thought he was going to die
5130339 he was diagnosed with epstein barr virus which is pretty much the same thing but you dont die from it
5130340 i dont blame him because all the doctors are doing it
5130341 id like to know how many people have been told they have west nile
5130342 this has been going on since west nile came into utah some doctors will base things on symptoms and not do tests
5130343 like any medical test they can be expensive and if people dont have insurance then sometimes the doctor will go ahead and try to help the patient
5130344 whether theyre helping or not may be something of a question
5130345 he said well it sounds like youve got west nile
5130346 it was really strange it was just contradictory to what we had heard on the news and what seemed to be happening everywhere
5130347 i ended up going to the doctor in the springtime
5130348 they found out that i was really anemic the question i have now is did i ever really have it am i immune to it am i going to get it again
5130349 people who have been told they have it are out on the lake not really worrying about it
5130350 i cant imagine how many people have been told that
5130351 maybe theres something seriously wrong that they dont know about and they say nah its west nile
5130352 we try to do education for physicians and stuff like that thats the best we can do is try to educate people of what tests to draw and those kinds of things
5130353 thats the only way to tell for sure if theres west nile

5130362 in the immediate future we plan to add new hotels to our portfolio in partnership with the wellex group
5130363 there is nothing concrete at this point there are talks but they are still in the exploratory stage acquisition of a property there is an option because we just have to run it but there are also benefits in constructing our own since we can configure it the way we want it to
5130364 it is wise to have a property in bohol because it also augments the operations here in cebu since panglao is a prime destination in bohol it is ideal to have a property there
5130365 occupancy levels continue to be over 50 percent while average room rate increases annually bringing revenue per available room revpar to p1 430 in 2007 net income of our flagship hotel increased by 45 percent reaching p24 69 million last year over p17 million in 2006

5130606 our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic avian flu has already been created through genetic engineering in the united states fusing the deadly genome of the 1918 pandemic misnamed the spanish flu with the dna of the innocuous h5n1 virus in a growth medium of human kidney cells according to the national institutes of health and the vaccines manufacturer some virologists believe that this would insure that the man made mutant virus recognizes human cells and knows how to invade them
5130607 a basic virological fact that the public has not been told is that it is impossible to make a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist
5130608 given the shockingly obvious lack of any threat from an un weaponized h5n1 virus how can we explain the bush administration spending billions of dollars preparing each of the 50 states for what it calls the inevitable bird flu pandemic which they say could kill half or more of all americans and similar numbers of people around the globe
5130609 tyson foods inc has begun killing and burying the carcasses of 15 000 hens from a flock that tested positive for exposure to a strain of the bird flu in northwest arkansas state officials said tuesday
5130610 one of the highest rates of injury and illness of any industry
5130611 dangerous chemicals blood faecal matter exacerbated by poor ventilation and often extreme temperatures workers typically faced hazardous conditions loud noise must work in narrow confines with sharp tools and dangerous machinery
5130612 an experiment mating h5n1 avian flu viruses and a strain of human flu in a laboratory produced a surprising number of hybrid viruses that were biologically fit a new study reveals and while none of the offspring viruses was as virulent as the original h5n1 about one in five were lethal to mice at low doses showing they retained at least a portion of the power of their dangerous parent
5130613 the work suggests that under the right circumstances and no one is clear what all of those are the two types of flu viruses could swap genes in a way that might allow the h5n1 virus to acquire the capacity to trigger a pandemic that process is called reassortment this study is just showing exactly that there is a risk this virus can successfully reassort with a human virus said richard webby director of the world health organizations collaborating centre for influenza research at st jude hospital in memphis tennessee
5130614 terrifying biological weapons capable of killing only people of specific ethnic groups
5130615 the u s government is taking steps to minimize the need to make vaccine allocation decisions by supporting efforts to increase domestic influenza vaccine production capacity significant funding is being provided to develop new vaccine technologies that allow production of enough pandemic influenza vaccine for any person in the united states who wants to be vaccinated within six months of a pandemic declaration
5130616 two injections given 28 days apart may provide limited protection if a pandemic occurs
5130617 if h5n1 does mutate it is unclear if vaccines developed now would still work against a pandemic strain
5130618 three polish doctors and six nurses are facing criminal prosecution after a number of homeless people died following medical trials for a vaccine to the h5n1 bird flu virus
5130619 the spanish flu influenza virus that killed 20 40 million people in 1918 is currently under reconstruction several genes of the extraordinarily lethal 1918 flu virus have been isolated and introduced into contemporary flu strains these proved to be lethal for mice while virus constructs with genes from a current flu virus types had hardly any effect these experiments may easily be abused for military purposes but provide little benefit from a medical or public health point of view
5130620 the 1918 spanish flu was highly infectious and in comparison to contemporary flu viruses killed a very high percentage of those infected including many younger people the spanish flu alone caused the medium life expectancy in the us in 1918 to drop by 10 years hence flu viruses are perceived today as a serious biological warfare threat just two weeks ago a 15 million dollar research grant was awarded in the us to develop protective measures especially against a bioterrorist attack with flu viruses
5130621 despite the very dangerous nature of the 1918 virus efforts to reconstruct it started in the mid 1990s when dr jeffrey taubenberger from the us armed forces institute of pathology in washington dc succeeded in recovering and sequencing fragments of the viral rna from preserved tissues of 1918 victims in the current issue of the scientific journal emerging infectious diseases new genetic details of the 1918 flu virus will be published
5130622 but after partially unravelling the genetic sequence of the virus the scientists went a step further and began bringing the spanish flu back to life unnoticed by the public they succeeded in creating a live virus containing two 1918 genes that proved to be very lethal in animal experiments this experiment is only one genetic step away from taking the 1918 demon entirely out of the bottle
5130623 a resuscitation of the spanish flu is neither necessary nor warranted from a public health point of view
5130624 were tempted to say that nobody in their right mind would ever use these things

5130627 the h5n1 virus is currently circulating in some of the poorest regions of the world and an outbreak of pandemic influenza would most likely hit populations living in areas with limited access to vaccines this donation of h5n1 vaccine aims to address the needs of those most vulnerable populations in addition to supporting the efforts of governments
5130628 it is essential that industry collaborates with international organizations such as who the bill and melinda gates foundation and other global health players

5130630 the transformation of poultry production in asia in recent decades is staggering in the southeast asian countries where most of the bird flu outbreaks are concentrated thailand indonesia and viet nam production jumped eightfold in just 30 years from around 300 000 metric tonnes mt of chicken meat in 1971 to 2 440 000 mt in 2001 chinas production of chicken tripled during the 1990s to over 9 million metric tons per year

5130662 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work

5130689 from the rolleiflex 6 x 6 which from the beginning set the pattern for the development of the twin lens reflex camera the rolleiflex 4 x 4 has taken the basic principles of its construction two separate cameras are joined by means of a common sturdy die cast body to make a twin camera below the taking camera for exposing the film and above the viewing camera using the reflecting mirror principle the special function of the viewing part of the twin camera is to permit focusing on the ground glass and to supply a control image essentially similar to the wanted picture

5130717 founded in september 1919 the communist party of the united states of america is an organization unique in american history it is not a true political party and differs fundamentally from all political parties in this country it is in fact a russian inspired moscow dominated anti american quasi military conspiracy against our government our ideals and our freedoms

5130719 frank marshall davis a forgotten voice in the chicago black renaissance
5130720 from now on i knew i would be described as a communist but frankly i had reached the stage where i didnt give a damn too many people i respected as freedom fighters were listed as red for me to fear name calling
5130721 due to his associates and involvement in what were considered in the forties to be radical communist groups
5130722 however by the time he davis returned to chicago and the renaissance he inevitably associated with people connected with the communist party since they were most likely to be involved in civil rights labor art and the fight for equality it seems that davis did join the party for a short time although on other occasions he denied it
5130723 davis met richard wright through his 1936 participation in the national negro congress which was alleged to be a communist front organization
5130724 davis did not see wright again after openly criticizing wrights attack of sic the communist party following the latters defection although both men held on to the hope of equality
5130725 davis joined the league of american writers a national united front organization for the communist party mobilized by the alarming rise of power of hitler and mussolini
5130726 if the relationship with davis was as blas as the associated press makes it sound why is obama mum about it and why did he try to hide davis identity in his first memoir published in 1995
5130727 with the exception of my family and a handful of public figures the names of most characters have been changed for the sake of privacy
5130728 but there was no need to protect davis privacy he had long been dead more likely the cryptic references to his communist mentor were and still are designed to protect obamas background from the scrutiny it deserves

5130785 the rogue executive defense is a well trodden excuse that should fool no one
5130786 this device had the potential to cause a significant amount of damage to the driver innocent passers by the vehicle and surrounding properties
5130787 it was only the keen observation of the driver that prevented this from becoming a potentially fatal incident
5130788 we strongly believe that somebody in the local community knows who was involved in this incident and we urge them to contact police
5130789 the olympics was one of the goals of the season for me so obviously the quarter finals is not going to do it
5130790 i think james played well i can only really say how well he played ive played him on many occasions but i think this was the best ive seen him
5130791 im happy for him i hope he can go all the way now

5130795 now is a terrific time for renewables to launch i hope they get all the capital they need and all the great minds and talent but i dont want it to come at the expense of the oil and gas industry
5130796 as goes colorado so goes the west as far as this energy policy debate
5130797 the future in colorado is building wind farms in wheat fields

5130800 no coal no nukes we wont stop until you do
5130801 as peaceful protesters who have plead guilty to a misdemeanor trespassing charge i find these fines especially egregious considering these charges typically carry a 100 fine
5130802 these fines are based on an association that the state never proved it is charging protestors for all of the costs of the police overtime spent on watching the southeast climate convergence action camp when some of the protestors had no association with this camp further it is unconstitutional to base fines on the costs of errors in staffing made by the police
5130803 dominion should be thanking us for pointing out the failure in their climate change policies
5130804 its ironic fda would choose to ignore dozens of studies funded by the national institutes of health this countrys best scientists and instead rely on flawed studies from industry
5130805 a federal health agency the ntp acknowledged for the first time yesterday concerns that a chemical found in thousands of everyday products such as baby bottles and compact discs may cause cancer and other serious disorders
5130806 what weve got is a warning a signal of some concerns
5130807 we could not dismiss the possibility that similar or related effects might occur in humans
5130808 the fda previously declared the chemical safe but agreed to revisit that opinion after a report by the federal national toxicology program said there was
5130809 the fact that i was not asked for my opinion has caused me a great deal of pain and hurt
5130810 i dont pass my wifes shop and my family dont pass it
5130811 its 15 feet away from the shop and i dont know why this wasnt thought out thats the spot where people fell and died and were hurt and i include those people who were traumatised

5130813 my wife was a very serene woman she was a very good wife and mother and the sad thing is she would have made a great grandmother
5130814 ive broken my health but thats of no importance as you get older its libby that im worried about
5130815 you cant get closure if she had died by gods hands that would have been different but someone took her right to life
5130816 im sure that in the future we will get justice of some sort im very very determined
5130817 no but i heard putin say it so it must be true
5130818 why cant i die today and not burden anyone anymore
5130819 you really cant do this and i know it you wont be able to do it its beyond your capability so as long as you give it a positive effort its ok by me try as much as you want itll never happen

5130874 the view shed concept is extending itself beyond the battlefield thats worrisome
5130875 the park service is getting into land use and development beyond its geographic responsibility
5130876 we are not then to call the depravity of human nature wickedness taking the word in its strict sense as a disposition the subjective principle of the maxims to adopt evil as evil into our maxim as our incentives for that is diabolical we should rather term it the perversity of the heart which then because of what follows from it is also called an evil heart such a heart may coexist with a will which in general is good it arises from the frailty of human nature the lack of sufficient strength to follow out the principles it has chosen for itself
5130877 induction a posteriori would have brought phrenology to admit as an innate and primitive principle of human action a paradoxical something which we may call perverseness for want of a more characteristic term
5130878 there lives no man who at some period has not been tormented for example by an earnest desire to tantalize a listener by circumlocution
5130879 we have a task before us which must be speedily performed we know that it will be ruinous to make delay we glow we are consumed with eagerness to commence the work with the anticipation of whose glorious result our whole souls are on fire it must it shall be undertaken to day and yet we put it off until to morrow and why there is no answer except that we feel perverse using the word with no comprehension of the principle

5130887 i wanna be where the jedis are i wanna swing wanna swing light sabers
5130888 i was working on a record and we would have lunch outside the studio everyday and this really beautiful girl would walk by and all the guys at the table would stop talking and just sit spellbound they were all terrified of ever talking to her so no one dared to speak but i at least wrote this song so maybe she knows
5130889 well you arent driving my kids around without a license he let me use his car the night i moved out so that he could go on a date with heidi im seriously sick of his shit and its gonna end badly for him
5130890 la sensaci n que se nos qued fue buena lo importante es que conseguimos otra victoria que vale para coger confianza y nos viene de maravilla
5130891 era el primer partido que jug bamos en nuestro campo y ganar es importante tenemos que afrontar el d a 31 de agosto con todas las garant as
5130892 estoy muy feliz por la oportunidad de debutar en osasuna el gol fue cuesti n de suerte y de trabajo el equipo me ha dado una buena impresi n igual que el ambiente que hab a en el campo
5130893 disfruto visitando nuevos circuitos y estoy deseando meterme en el coche el viernes por la ma ana me parece que ser una pista incre ble
5130894 todo el mundo est en la misma situaci n al llegar a un circuito nuevo as que no lo trato de forma muy diferente por supuesto hemos hecho algunos preparativos antes de la carrera pero nuestro principal objetivo ser n las tres sesiones libres antes de la calificaci n trabajar con mis ingenieros para empezar el fin de semana con una buena base
5130895 habr que reformar el sardinero y si no jugaremos los partidos de la uefa en alg n estadio con el nivel exigido
5130896 s podemos tenemos un estadio digno hablaremos con la administraci n celebraremos los partidos en el sardinero los partidos de la uefa y si no podemos se ir fuera
5130897 es un rally muy especial para m y como no podremos venir el a o que viene ha sido bonito ganar nos hemos encontrado c modos con el coche todo el fin de semana y ahora estoy en la mejor posici n de cara al resto de la temporada tal vez nueva zelanda sea un poco m s dif cil al salir el primero porque hay mucha grava pero de momento me alegro de liderar el campeonato estoy contento con el trabajo que dani y yo hemos hecho para citro n
5130898 estoy contento porque un segundo puesto es un buen resultado para los dos campeonatos para m en el de pilotos y tambi n para citro n que se ha puesto a la cabeza en el de constructores a n sigo queriendo ganar un rally pero no ha podido ser ste el primer d a comet algunos errores y perd mucho tiempo pero el segundo modifiqu la suspensi n y desde entonces todo ha ido bien para el equipo este doblete es un gran aliciente
5130899 the win is extremely important to start off at home
5130900 i think we were a little rusty at times in the first half but certainly the second we got a bit more cohesion so i was really pleased with how we finished off the game
5130901 once we went a goal down we had to look at trying to get in behind them their centre backs are quite slow so we wanted to inject a bit of pace but we just couldnt get the right ball to nikita
5130902 without a doubt the springboks wont want to suffer again at home
5130903 its hard for the springboks now to win the tournament but hence their likely response as a result of today
5130904 they are world champions and there is no way they will be excited about contemplating another loss you cant hide it will be a great opportunity coming at the end of the week it will only be what we make of it
5130905 it was great to be there it was great to be able to witness it live the score appears to be one sided but the contest itself was very much anything but that
5130906 and the first half was probably the biggest indicator of that there was an awful amount of rugby played in that first half but there was very little to show for it it was 5 0 on the scoreboard at half time
5130907 the all blacks got home and they played well they absorbed the pressure and there was a significant amount of pressure from the boks
5130908 they absorbed that and took the points not always by the boot but they were able to score three tries and that was the difference
5130909 there were times they survived on defence when there was probably no other side in the world that would have because the boks did bring a lot of pressure to bear and it looked on occasions like scoring was inevitable but they hung in there and they defended very well
5130910 both sides had a huge intensity it was only late in the game when the game got away from the springboks that they were forced to play a game that they werent really that comfortable with and it cost them
5130911 he played a few games in the west indies his batting has really come on in the past few years and his bowling is going ok
5130912 he is definitely in there as an all round option
5130913 i am not sure if they will go hopefully a decision will be made soon
5130914 if australia does go i am not sure if they will want to take a specialist spinner or stick with what they have been doing
5130915 michael clarke and andrew symonds showed they could do the job in the world cup and the recent tour of the west indies i guess that is the right choice for the time being
5130916 listen im not like the other guys okay i wear jeans and flip flops to work i wear t shirts to meetings sometimes sometimes i dont shave

5130930 i say let me go and search for some food
5130931 in my grandfathers time there was rain in my fathers time there was rain
5130932 but now the rain is decreasing and decreasing and decreasing so there is nothing to eat
5130933 issue well meaning edicts such as increase food production 30 in your district
5130934 the situation on the ground is known by everybody we are working transparently and closely with our partners
5130935 all the stars are aligned now and the situation is stabilized
5130936 we dont need to beat the drum of hunger for ethiopia every year
5130937 were past the time when food was abundant and cheap to transport
5130938 theres this fatigue heres ethiopia again looking for food again
5130939 in order to protect themselves the british soldiers launched three rockets all of which hit the target unbeknown to the patrol the civilians were inside the compound at the time
5130940 the casualties were treated at a nearby isaf medical facility where two of them children remain seriously ill
5130941 isaf deeply regrets the tragedy of this incident when women and children were killed and injured as a result of an imminent insurgent attack from a position where they would have known women and children were present
5130942 i dont want to be the vice president i am not going to be the nominee
5130943 i dont think you can control the entire world from one centre
5130944 there are big nations there are huge populations there is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world so what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order if i can say it should emerge
5130945 there are so many important issues like the nuclear issue iraq the caucasus and afghanistan
5130946 iran is definitely having some influence on these issues so we are talking
5130947 its a bit strange for us really because were kind of up on the mountain and i think its actually the people back down here at home that went through more trauma than we went through
5130948 we have finalized the cmp that will be publicized tomorrow
5130949 we have not put forward any hindrance to reach an agreement and our discussions are focused on the allocation of the ministerial portfolio
5130950 before we know it 45 countries will be negotiating with us
5130951 in a sense the u s will act as indias sherpa at the nsg
5130952 the indians will need to convince the nuclear suppliers group that it should give the same kind of international treatment in terms of civil nuclear trade to india that the united states would have just given bilaterally
5130953 without any change to the draft that was circulated to them recently
5130954 it was nice to see everyone showing what they can do on the field
5130955 the only proper tribute to omaghs dead ten years on must be that full cross border public inquiry
5130956 we call on public figures to back our call otherwise the system continues to fail everyone and should hold its head in shame
5130957 they will be judged not on their token gestures but on what they have or have not done to actually bring justice to omagh not wreathes
5130958 over the past ten years we have taken control of our own lives we could not allow terrorists to dictate to us we will continue to do what is right for us
5130959 if i was with you today i would ask you to do one thing and that is to look to the future a new generation is growing up in omagh and it is to them that we should be looking
5130960 static memorials have their place but living memorials have tremendous value
5130961 all the struggles before and everything i went through to get back healthy it really makes this championship special to me this is one of the best tracks weve ridden all year i really want to thank kawasaki for all the hard work theyve put in
5130962 two months ago i was just settling for second i had to believe in myself to get where i am now and compared to last year when i didnt win at all im thankful to be healthy and having success

5130964 i think i hit a wet spot the next thing i know i was rolling on the ground i didnt know exactly where i needed to finish but i had an idea i just wanted to finish second because i knew i could catch them
5130965 the number of gps systems being stolen is astounding and what makes it more concerning is that this is a preventable crime ms nixon said today
5130966 theft from motor car is a purely opportunistic offence if people did not leave valuables in their cars then thieves would simply keep walking past their vehicle
5130967 i am pleased to see that once again there has been a drop in the number of crimes reported across victoria and this is a credit to the hard work of our members
5130968 this may be linked to the increased possession of small expensive electrical items including mobile phones and mp3 players
5130969 often young people are the victims and the offenders people also tend to use them while waiting at public transport locations or when out and about
5130970 these figures have increased from 15 per cent to 23 7 per cent since 2004
5130971 we are pleased with this increase as it shows that people are beginning to have the confidence to report what is really happening
5130972 since its beginning in may 2006 toms has given over 10 000 pairs of shoes to children in argentina and 50 000 pairs in south africa through the purchases of our caring customers in 2008 toms plans to give 200 000 pairs of shoes to children in need around the world our ongoing community events and shoe drops allow toms supporters and enthusiasts to be a part of this one for one movement

5131006 chris cotteril the citys top attorney said the contract was a creative way to save taxpayer money and that the company was taking a big risk ballard pointed out that the city would make the final decision on any sales
5131007 another company bales owned meridian asset development drew attention from city officials three years ago when it was hired to find buildings for county agencies to rent and ended up buying the buildings and becoming the developer

5131010 lo mejor ha sido escuchar el himno alem n en el podio se me ha puesto la piel de gallina las tres ltimas vueltas han sido las peores porque perd a la concentraci n y ten a que decirme que estaba a punto de ganar un gran premio ahora hay dos bradl en la familia que han ganado en el mundial he cumplido mi misi n
5131011 ha sido una carrera muy complicada porque he ido escalando posiciones poco a poco y cuando he llegado con los de delante bradl ya se hab a escapado as que las opciones de victoria eran m nimas yo sab a que ten a un buen ritmo para mantenerme arriba pero desconoc a el del resto ahora me siento muy feliz muy contento por este cuarto podio de la temporada
5131012 many ossetians i met both in tskhinvali and in the main refugee camp in russia are furious about what has happened to their city
5131013 they are very clear who they blame georgias president mikhail saakashvili who sent troops to re take control of this breakaway region
5131014 looking at where weve come from in the last month to see the side go out and perform like that is disappointing but understanding of where were at
5131015 i just thought at times today the players werent demanding on each other enough when st kilda were kicking the ball down
5131016 from a scoreboard point of view we did take a step back but maybe thats where the depth of our list is
5131017 the games not that difficult from just a basic thing like manning up when theyve got the ball
5131018 it takes a bit of organisation a little bit of concentration and at times youre not going to finish up on your direct opponent but thats how you cover for each other
5131019 we have too many guys that sit back and spectate when that happens
5131020 we just allowed them to do what they wanted to do too easily whenever we looked like getting on the counterattack there was fumbling and lack of composure and understanding between each other
5131021 i wasnt happy about how easy it came to riewoldt and thats reflective of the lack of effort up the field
5131022 we have got three four or five guys that are six foot three who should be able to handle that situation
5131023 im trying to put it right on guys that are in situations that represent the value of the game and what they can do about and it will mean playing on the elite players from the opposition
5131024 looking at where weve come from in the last month to see the side go out and perform like that is disappointing but understanding of where were at
5131025 today i was very very nervous because i was the favourite to win the tournament del potro said
5131026 in a final if you play your best you can win for sure but i think today i played more with my mind than my body
5131027 today i was very very nervous because i was the favourite to win the tournament amp squo amp squo del potro said
5131028 in a final if you play your best you can win for sure but i think today i played more with my mind than my body
5131029 the film is a romantic comedy and very light hearted the first half has shah rukh as the casanova whos very stylish he falls in love with the girl played by newbie anushka sharma however after realising that shes a simple girl who likes basic things in life shah rukh takes on the role of a simpleton he tries to convince anushka that hes a simple guy and cons her into believing that she falls for him and later he has to struggle to reveal his true identity to her
5131030 this is a crazy bolt effect i am just so happy to put jamaica on the map no one expected me to win so there was no pressure
5131031 were all great athletes and im very excited about the tremendous achievement were very good athletes and this says a lot for our country
5131032 i had to go but i was off step that threw me off a lot im pretty sure it was a false start
5131033 hey its just twilight whats the worst that could happen
5131034 she recognized that she had been privileged by affirmative action and she was very comfortable with that
5131035 i didnt see a whole lot of people who were just thrilled to be there
5131036 i met people who thought this was a good life but were people waking up just bounding out of bed to get to work no
5131037 i figured that they were just impressed with any black man with a suit and a job
5131038 i remember that she was tall almost my height in heels and lovely with a friendly professional manner
5131039 michelle was full of plans that day on the fast track with no time she told me for distractions especially men
5131040 the world as it is and the world as it should be
5131041 tactfully overlooking my limited wardrobe and she even tried to set me up with a couple of her friends
5131042 he is really different in addition to being nice and funny and cute and all that hes got a seriousness and a commitment that you dont see every day
5131043 well you know id like to be married to somebody who felt that deeply about things
5131044 maybe i didnt say marry scratch that part it took him a little while
5131045 the first thing i was worried about was is this poor guy going to make the cut
5131046 how long is it going to be until he gets fired
5131047 he didnt tell us that he was running for president of the harvard law review we never realized that he was as bright as he is
5131048 we would have this running debate throughout our relationship about whether marriage was necessary
5131049 it was sort of a bone of contention because i was like look buddy im not one of these wholl just hang out forever
5131050 he took me out to a nice dinner under the guise of celebrating the fact that he had finished the bar
5131051 and he got me into one of these discussions again where you know he sort of just led me down there and got fired up and its like youve got blah blah blah blah and then dessert comes out the tray comes out and theres a ring
5131052 because barack was so smart he was pretty serious when we were in our thirties
5131053 at some point in our forties i said to michelle you know i think hes so much grown into who he is now hes so much more lighthearted because he became a senator and he had this wonderful outlet to be a policy person and to be intense and when he got home he could relax and laugh and just have dinner with friends and talk about movies and basketball
5131054 oh god um ive voted every time that i could vote but i doesnt stand out
5131055 there is no difference between the public michelle and the private michelle
5131056 we will work on accomplishing it within the coming weeks
5131057 such a decision will be followed by some logistical measures which need to be taken by both countries in order to put the agreement into effect
5131058 the ones we know about have committed criminal offenses in syria
5131059 we inquired about other people and we are still waiting for a response from syrian officials
5131060 later the cabinet will issue a separate decree for an embassy in syria
5131061 then all that remains in front of us are procedural steps which the two foreign ministries will be tasked with taking
5131062 the syrians do not need an embassy to operate in lebanon they have their intelligence as well as their allies
5131063 referring the issue of lebanese prisoners in syrian jails to committees is equivalent to killing it we all know that forming committees will not help in resolving the issue
5131064 demarcating borders in the shebaa farms area will help liberate the occupied territory whereas excluding it aims at creating pretexts for hizbullah to hold on to its arms
5131065 we are not saying that to turn our back to discussing a defense strategy for lebanon but to say that there are other important issues which need to be discussed during national dialogue sessions
5131066 we need to address economic and social issues as well as ways to implement the decisions that were taken during earlier dialogue sessions
5131067 they the us have been issuing statements saying they want fiji to return to democratic rule the us has also increased investment in its military base in guam
5131068 globally the big concern is that the region is not on track to meet its development goals and thats despite economic growth and lots of aid from australia new zealand and the us
5131069 these countries are the highest per capita receivers of aid anywhere in the world but there are still law and order and corruption problems in papua new guinea and the solomon islands the economy is still too reliant on australia and aid it is the fragility of some of these nations that is in question some of them could revert
5131070 we have great potential here for tourism and the forum must also focus on sustainable economies
5131071 we have been saying that the im has emerged with this new name but is an old organisation
5131072 the statement has been given by the gujarat police but nothing of this sort had come out in our probe
5131073 i appeal to you that after your armed forces leave georgian territory to start serious thinking and discussions about further negotiations a further search for ways to conduct relations in order not to sow discord between our countries for good
5131074 lets not sow discord for future generations i dont appeal to your mercy but i appeal to your pragmatism and simple common sense i think the time to make the right decisions has come
5131075 the word of the russian president needs to be upheld by his forces or people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5131076 for them the hardliners the strategic aim of the invasion was not achieved so it was a defeat this creates problems in moscow
5131077 they may not be against subduing the georgians but the question is at what price
5131078 either java script is turned off or you have an old version of macro medias flash player
5131079 oh my god shut the hell up and be satiated for once in your obviously incredibly miserable liiiiiivveeess
5131080 housing will bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
5131081 oil may hit 110 a barrel but it will not go below 100 a barrel
5131082 we now have three balance sheets all coming under pressure at the same time housing consumers and the financial sector
5131083 inflation is going to be a bigger factor over the next three years firms must raise capital or sell assets assets are sold for fire sale prices resulting in eventual capital raises which cause them to raise their cost of capital to clients
5131084 fasten your seat belt and dont put yourself in a position where you will have to be a forced seller
5131085 u s will fall into a recession how bad it is dependant on home price declines
5131086 commodities have peaked because the world is now in a recession which will reduce demand
5131087 the fundamentals for commodities are astoundingly good and the bull market has a long way to go
5131088 it is inconceivable that we come out of a recession by the end of the year
5131089 the fed will not hike rates anytime soon inflation concerns will abate
5131090 stocks return 10 a year on average over the long run
5131091 i dont want to go potty in there im scared of the skunk
5131092 the one thats making it smell so bad in there
5131093 payton leave your shoe on there is nothing in it its just your imagination
5131094 i cant put it on i think paytons magination is in my shoe too
5131095 we are once again overwhelmed by the reaction to homebake and do announce that homebake 08 peace in the park has completely sold out in record time organisers said today
5131096 once again we extend our sincerest gratitude to all who have shown their support
5131097 with such intense and surprising reaction we can at least proudly proclaim that the local music industry is well and truly in a healthy shape
5131098 we are hoping to get into patients within the next 12 months or so
5131099 we know at the moment in rat studies that our compound inhibited the development of fibrosis and the interesting thing in the future would be to see whether we can actually reverse fibrosis
5131100 currently we have some quite strong data showing that our compounds prevent fibrosis occurring
5131101 we have looked at it in a series of animal models that are very predictive of clinical outcomes hence the reason we are quite confident that our data is robust
5131102 a lot of the remodelling or the fibrosis that occurs in patients with heart attacks causes the heart to fail over the short term
5131103 if it was the first of its kind on the market it would be a huge step forward because there are currently no anti fibrotics on the market
5131104 there is no doubt that this has been an enormous fall from grace for a man that lived 61 years in an exemplary fashion judge sexton said
5131105 sin expediente t cnico ni pensar en poner la primera ni la segunda piedra ni avisos enga osos a pocos d as del 15 de agosto como se quiso hacer
5131106 hay hacinamiento en consulta externa hospitalizaci n sala de operaciones estamos sin agua potable sin servicios higi nicos suficientes lo que ha provocado el aumento del porcentaje de infecciones intra hospitalarias
5131107 la comunidad debe saber que nos est n convirtiendo a los m dicos y dem s trabajadores en portadores de las enfermedades de un paciente a otro porque ni siquiera podemos lavarnos las manos para no contaminarlos es decir todo tiene un l mite
5131108 si el estado no garantiza las condiciones y el equipamiento no podr obligarnos a ejercer el acto m dico en esas condiciones y por respeto tendremos que decirles a la poblaci n hasta ac no podemos seguir atendiendo y entregaremos hospitales

5131111 if there wasnt a curve in it you could see both city limits signs
5131112 we are going through one of the most uncertain and difficult periods in the world of finance that weve seen in recent history
5131113 any firm especially one as widespread as carlyle is going to have some stumbles but what is more germane is to judge a firm by its long term record of returns to investors and it seems to me that they have done a darn good job in that category
5131114 with innovation comes the occasional setback however over 20 years product and geographic expansion has served our investors well generating firm wide 26 percent annual net rates of return
5131115 our portfolio is solid and performing on plan we bought strong companies financed them conservatively and are working hard to create additional value
5131116 its not in my nature to close doors but i think ive taken the sport as far as i can take it
5131117 theres a lot of very exciting things to do in life and ive got a lot on my plate starting in two weeks
5131118 it was basically to the point where i couldnt walk
5131119 it was just brutal theres no way to describe it i was lying over an ottoman for 3 1 2 months
5131120 ive had reconstructive surgery on both my shoulders and my back i think thats a big thing for looking at this being a good point for me to step aside
5131121 it is a family and it goes both ways between the athletes and the coaches
5131122 whats so special about this is if you win an olympic gold medal together youre friends for life its just such a special relationship that you can have with eight other people
5131123 the reason they moved is in the 60s the vietnam war was going on
5131124 my dad was conscripted and went through that fortunately he didnt have to go over it was a very bad period for the u s and saskatchewan and canada was just a great place to move
5131125 they both worked at the university of saskatchewan for their whole careers thats kind of how it unfolded canada is such a great country and is so much in line with the european philosophy and world view
5131126 i feel like kind of a weight has been taken off my shoulders ive had a long career and this is the capstone of it i just feel so proud

5131142 he is just playing out of this world at the moment and deserves to be number one
5131143 i arrived here very tired after flying directly from cincinnati
5131144 i just want to enjoy this moment because im having an unbelievable year this is more than my best dreams
5131145 i know how tough it is to win medals especially here this is just unbelievable
5131146 a medal is a great goal i did it in athens and i did it here
5131147 the olympics is special for me im really happy im little bit sad about the match but all things considered im really happy
5131148 that is the best thing that has happened to me in my life and my career
5131149 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5131150 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5131151 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5131152 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5131153 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5131154 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5131155 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5131156 i want to inspire people to a cause greater than themselves
5131157 all i know is there is water where it didnt used to be and im responsible for dealing with that
5131158 i think were at a crisis point on making a decision

5131190 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5131191 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5131192 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5131193 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5131202 temptability depends upon the constitutional susceptibility while impeccability depends upon the will so far as his natural susceptibility both physical and mental was concerned jesus christ was open to all forms of human temptation excepting those that spring out of lust or corruption of nature but his peccability or the possibility of being overcome by these temptations would depend upon the amount of voluntary resistance which he was able to bring to bear against them those temptations were very strong but if the self determination of his holy will was stronger than they then they could not induce him to sin and he would be impeccable and yet plainly he would be temptable
5131203 the prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me
5131204 we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are without sin
5131205 this text teaches that the temptations of christ were without sin in their source and nature and not merely as the passage is sometimes explained that they were without sin in their result
5131206 the fact that christ was almighty and victorious in his resistance does not unfit him to be an example for imitation to a weak and sorely tempted believer because our lord overcame his temptations it does not follow that his conflict and success was an easy one for him his victory cost him tears and blood his visage was so marred more than any man isa 52 14 there was the travail of his soul isa 52 14 in the struggle he cried o my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me matt 26 39 because an army is victorious it by no means follows that the victory was a cheap one

5131216 in the next few months growers will be informed of their water allocation for the 2008 2009 growing season ms hellams said
5131217 with water supply at critical levels there is every indication that this allocation will not increase from last year and in some cases it may be less
5131218 research shows that it is possible to grow profitable crops on reduced water supplies but management systems must change she said
5131219 growers need to know more about the exact water they need how to access additional irrigation water and understand more about the allocation decision making process
5131220 they also need to know about how to maintain the long term health of their vineyard
5131221 having more knowledge about the market empowers growers to make more strategic decisions ms hellams said

5131274 we expected the olympics would not be a powerful marketing tool but the opposite has been the case the market hasnt matured to the stage of the us or uk in terms of marketing literacy and the celebrity aspect is still very strong if you can tie liu xiang or yao ming to your product that has a big impact
5131275 other countries are interested in the olympics but in china well over 90 of people are passionate and supportive and want to be involved
5131276 for us its about connecting with athletes we make products that make them perform better and then build on the excitement that creates

5131294 the hospital has recognised as has the state of nsw that we need to do something and face this problem
5131295 they have to be post pubescent and there isnt the funding in nsw to actually do surgery on adolescents
5131296 part of the nsw health plan is looking towards funding some of that so we may actually see an increase in surgical measures for severely obese older adolescents

5131313 we are concerned about the phenomena of burn out among experienced investigators who have left the office since 2005

5131315 i have a strong case that is why i am appealing the judgment
5131316 i came out of the press conference in a state of shock
5131317 he painted a picture no scholar would recognise he was basically calling for regime change making a political statement which is surprising coming from the chief prosecutor of the icc
5131318 by presenting his case in such stark terms the prosecutor has made it easy for his critics to dismiss him as ill informed and driven by a desire for publicity and has made it harder for the advocates of justice in darfur to pursue the challenge of calling to account those responsible for crimes no less heinous than genocide

5131428 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5131438 estamos acertando con los fichajes para que el sevilla funcione bien se han ido jugadores importantes que jugaban pr cticamente de memoria pero afortunadamente la secretar a t cnica ha trabajado muy bien y ha acertado en las incorporaciones

5131563 it is much more difficult once youve got established obesity to actually reverse that
5131564 so it would be nice to try and prevent it in the first place but at least this is a start
5131565 hello my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die
5131566 they are now in the poblacion area town centre they have taken over the business centre the rural banks pawnshops

5131580 the depeg story has gone away and as a result speculative money has exited the country drying access to funds
5131581 at the end of last year we were awash with liquidity but now that money has left the country
5131582 today we face strong opposition and their weapon primarily is the press
5131583 gold copper phosphate bauxite this place could be the next canada or australia
5131584 unfortunately the olympic spirit is not being respected at all by chinese officials in tibet
5131585 there are restrictions on the circulation of information very strong censorship
5131586 civilians are often arrested violently tortured to the point where they die its really very very sad
5131587 we appear to be substantially unaffected by this significant economic negative climate
5131588 we are as concerned as anybody else at the headlong plunge into the abyss that western civilization seems to be taking
5131589 adults have come to lead lives comparatively rich in material comforts and very poor in moral intellectual and spiritual tone
5131590 we do not think that these books are the only books worth reading we think that these books shed some light on all of our basic problems and that it is folly to do without any light we can get
5131591 a prevalent notion is that the great mass of the people cannot understand and cannot form an independent judgment upon any matter they cannot be educated in the sense of developing their intellectual powers but they can be bamboozled

5131600 irrigating with wastewater isnt a rare practice limited to a few of the poorest countries
5131601 its a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20 million hectares across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of sub saharan africa and in many latin american cities
5131602 that gives you an idea of the large potential of wastewater agriculture for both helping and hurting great numbers of urban consumers
5131603 of costs for providing clean water around the world go toward corruption
5131604 i really dont think religious minorities be they jewish muslim orthodox hindu sikh or others would have much chance under the system of a judicial appointments committee because they would be turned down on most occasions on the grounds they are not the most meritorious appointment
5131605 it would be argued there is always a good old boy more deserving the only way broader consideration would come into judicial appointments is because the government appoints them otherwise it would be a closed shop
5131606 the consciousness of the need to have women properly represented on the judiciary i think those views have developed about as quickly in government as they have on the bench
5131607 i think the views of government are mirrored in the views of the judiciary
5131608 i dont think it an independent board would have made any difference quite frankly
5131609 i didnt think affirmative action was an approach to an appointment
5131610 this combined with years of intense drought floods and bush fires has seen red kangaroos western grey kangaroos eastern grey kangaroos wallaroos and euros plummet to densities of less than five per square kilometre or quasi extinct across most of queensland nsw and south australia
5131611 these species are now at risk of extinction in these states if the commercial industry is allowed to continue
5131612 we have grave fears for the future existence of kangaroos and the fact that these state governments have already set commercial kill quotas at 12 to 20 per cent of the population for the next four years
5131613 thats why the states survey regularly and quotas are adjusted according to sustainable harvests
5131614 i would see this as very online with what forster recommended
5131615 he recommended a flatter structure greater performance greater accountability increased transparency and ensuring that the majority of our 8 5 billion budget is directed at clinical services
5131616 this will allow larger and better resourced districts to deliver local health services and important hospital building programs
5131617 more than anything people are saying to me there is confusion and some lack of clarity which can be rectified and there needs to be a decision as to where the accountabilities lie
5131618 there is no proof that carbon dioxide is causing or precedes global warming
5131619 all indications are that the minor warming cycle finished in 2001 and that arctic ice melting is related to cyclical orbit tilt axis changes in earths angle to the sun
5131620 as more than 80pc of australian exports are price taking commodities any carbon emissions cost is going to be borne by the domestic producer and exporter and require large compensation under any carbon trading scheme
5131621 this compensation will be seen as a producer subsidy under wto guidelines at a time when australia is supposed to be leading by good example in freer trade for the rest of the world
5131622 all this cost is borne by taxpayers yet where exactly are the benefits beyond normal pollution control regulations
5131623 farmers could be forced into bankruptcy by having to refund money they do not have

5131632 i dont have to prove that the constitution is perfect i just have to prove that its better than anything else
5131633 we can take away rights just as we can grant new ones

5131742 these are far more abundant in the united states than in the besieged gaza strip
5131743 last week i landed in washington d c brimming with optimism upon arrival i was whisked into a separate room an american official informed me that he had just received information about me that he could not reveal however it required him to put me on the next plane home i was shocked and i was taken aback at the cruelty of snatching away my educational dreams at the last possible moment
5131744 hundreds of palestinian students with dreams of improving their lives are stagnating intellectually in gaza
5131745 thankfully i have received support from people around the world journalists have wanted to hear my story the american officials who saw me in amman and jerusalem upon my return were friendly and seemed embarrassed by my predicament
5131746 the united states should use its tremendous sway with israel to advance the cause of freedom and equal rights for palestinians and israelis alike
5131747 we palestinians have been stripped of our land for 60 years
5131748 but with educational opportunity we have persevered and made what we could of our lives limiting our educational prospects only perpetuates our status as a subordinate people

5131900 on the evening of july 25th 1914 a meeting of the general staff took place at which it was decided to declare at once a preparatory mobilization period and further to declare a state of war over all fortresses and frontier stations war was already decided on and the whole flood of telegrams between the governments of russia and germany represented mere the stage setting mis en scene of an historical drama
5131901 at seven in the evening july 25th i went to the warsaw station to bid farewell to isvolsky who was leaving to rejoin his station great activity at the terminus the trains crowded with officers and troops all this points to mobilization we hurriedly exchanged our views of the situation and both arrive at the same conclusion this time it is war
5131902 on july 25 in company with several serbian officers i arrived at warsaw from berlin as far as the german frontier not the slightest indications were seen of military measures but immediately after crossing the german frontier into russian poland we noticed mobilization steps being taken on a grand scale assembly of freight cars in all the stations military occupation of the railway stations massing of troops in several cities transport of troops at night mobilization signalling when we arrived at brest litovsk july 25th the state of siege had already been proclaimed

5131932 i really dont think religious minorities be they jewish muslim orthodox hindu sikh or others would have much chance under the system of a judicial appointments committee because they would be turned down on most occasions on the grounds they are not the most meritorious appointment
5131933 it would be argued there is always a good old boy more deserving the only way broader consideration would come into judicial appointments is because the government appoints them otherwise it would be a closed shop
5131934 the consciousness of the need to have women properly represented on the judiciary i think those views have developed about as quickly in government as they have on the bench

5131973 theft from motor car is a purely opportunistic offence if people did not leave valuables in their cars then thieves would simply keep walking past their vehicle
5131974 i am pleased to see that once again there has been a drop in the number of crimes reported across victoria and this is a credit to the hard work of our members
5131975 this may be linked to the increased possession of small expensive electrical items including mobile phones and mp3 players

5131990 we have more and more screen activities and we have less and less actual physical activity so the combination tends towards gaining weight

5132001 the new iphone is performing very well on our network

5132010 if the lido boulevard project is allowed to proceed next month it will only strengthen singapore strategically
5132011 vessels passing by the johor straits will have to enter singapores water
5132012 if the project is to proceed they might as well extend the reclamation works of lido boulevard and create a second causeway to singapore because malaysian territorial waters will not be there anymore
5132013 a bridge built after lido boulevard will mean singapore controlling the waterways and shipping in the area with johor having voluntarily discarded the johor straits by dumping millions of tonnes of sands to build luxury condominiums
5132014 this development will not only change the johor baharu skyline but also raise our citys profile internationally
5132015 the idea is to design and reposition johor baharu as an international gateway to malaysia with a myriad of iconic buildings and top notch public amenities and facilities
5132016 the development blueprint is based on the theme of a garden city with landscaped gardens water fountains and park like facilities which will account for nearly a quarter of the entire development area

5132019 the claim it was a gun free zone was sort of a misnomer
5132020 what were trying to stop is people carrying loaded guns in a concealed manner in the nonsecure areas
5132021 it defuses their argument that there would be a stampede if someone has a gun at the airport
5132022 people have guns at the airport every day and there hasnt been a stampede
5132023 this is a gun free airport which means it is illegal to have loaded concealed weapons at the airport
5132024 the main part of the airport is just like any other public space in the state it should not be treated any differently than walking the streets of atlanta

5132028 in the next few months growers will be informed of their water allocation for the 2008 2009 growing season
5132029 with water supply at critical levels there is every indication that this allocation will not increase from last year and in some cases it may be less
5132030 research shows that it is possible to grow profitable crops on reduced water supplies but management systems must change
5132031 growers need to know more about the exact water they need how to access additional irrigation water and understand more about the allocation decision making process
5132032 they also need to know about how to maintain the long term health of their vineyard
5132033 having more knowledge about the market empowers growers to make more strategic decisions

5132069 thats in comparison with john mccain who is unafraid and incredibly willing to talk to any voter regardless of party affiliation

5132199 i was just kind of rushing and trying to do too much rather than just keeping it simple and making that one pitch that could have got me out of the inning
5132200 its not easy here there have been a lot of great pitchers that have failed numerous times and been able to rebound and figure it out the trick is just finding something every day that is going to get you in the zone and make you consistent thats just something i have to keep working at and discover
5132201 hes going to go through ups and downs i think the key for him is to throw strikes and not be afraid of the strike zone hes got good enough stuff hes just got to believe in it
5132202 the club does have some flexibility in that it is not technically a contest

5132205 we are very confident that an orioles fan will be able to win this prize
5132206 it was a good race i am very happy with that the time is not what matters here but i knew i was in the kind of shape to run a personal best

5132249 developers are the driving force behind android applications so without them it would be very hard for android to have a stance in the market
5132250 the android platform has a very strong base and a lot of potential but it also has a lot of competition
5132251 the adc finalists are helping us update the latest version of the sdk before we release it to the world in the coming weeks
5132252 we wanted to limit the challenges developers face with an early release in a particularly critical time during the challenge to not disadvantage them weve separated the scheduled releases to not disadvantage these winners who are competing for money and the public will receive a release of the sdk soon with more documentation and tools
5132253 these are combining to create a kind of a perfect storm that we have going on right now
5132254 you see it in rising food prices rising energy prices and a great land grab to produce biofuels the easiest way to grow these crops is to grab lands in the tropics from rainforests
5132255 meanwhile the developing world sees climate change as a train crashing through their countries but something that is not their fault
5132256 forests fall because they are worth more cut down than standing this is a classic example of a market failure
5132257 philanthropy and taxes by governments arent going to be enough to fund forest conservation efforts on the kind of scale thats going to be needed to have a real impact
5132258 but for a market 10 15 billion is quite manageable thats about what we drink in wine and champagne every year in britain for a fraction of the percent of the three trillion dollar a year insurance business we could save forests
5132259 the central issue in this whole debate is how we put a true value on standing rainforest to the world community
5132260 the indigenous communities probably have the best track record of any group in looking after their forests and preventing deforestation
5132261 the problem that we face is that under the redd mechanism being developed by the un there is a danger that these groups wont see compensation because they have a low deforestation baseline and are therefore not emitting
5132262 we need to think about how these communities who have succeeded in protecting their forests should get paid as i see it a method for this is the ecosystem services they are providing the world
5132263 the world is waking up to this and will drive capital to the canopy
5132264 how much money would you be prepared to pay governor braga of amazonas to keep the rain coming
5132265 a primary driver of deforestation is agribusiness in the amazon
5132266 why did this investment happen the very first in the world in iwokrama
5132267 okay so you are going to pay people for ecosystem services now that is just paying people to do nothing so youre going to pay them not to cut down their trees what are they going to do sleep in hammocks and drink beer
5132268 we dont need too much we are happy for our capital to be employed and will take a small return
5132269 well that means all the money will go to aaa
5132270 the market is not perfect there is going to be good guys and bad guys

5132375 in sonoma when they brought the sheet up to the lounge in the transporter with all the new numbers on it i thought they were kidding me
5132376 seriously up to that point i had not spent a second even thinking about it and figured we were dead and gone on the showdown scene no matter what but there it was and we were suddenly about 55 or so points out of the 8th spot that kind of opened my eyes
5132377 we thought we were chasing jerry toliver who was in 8th going into brainerd
5132378 we hadnt even bothered to look to see who was ahead of him or by how much turns out it was gary scelzi in front of toliver and only by five points we picked up a boatload of points on him and came out of brainerd only five points out of the showdown i really cant believe we got that close but we came here with a pretty simple assignment we just needed out out qualify a few guys and we would make it
5132379 other than winning in houston we really havent had any big exciting drama this year so the whole showdown thing was pretty cool and the guys are excited about what they accomplished
5132380 were in it now so all were worried about is racing bob tasca tomorrow were in a huge hole on the powerade side of things but it all has to start with the first round and if we can pick up a win there we can still make a move that would be a double comeback story for the ages and were not only going to have to be pretty flawless ourselves were also going to need some help to stop the guys were chasing but its still possible and were focused on it

5132549 i couldnt understand a word she was saying she was appalling

5132569 my calf was just so bad i had to stretch it the pain felt like it was coming up from my foot early in the race i had this weird feeling that someone was kicking my foot away while i was running
5132570 i would have walked because it was something that was actually okay walking i havent made the injury worse
5132571 if i felt i was doing some serious damage i would have stopped its horrible when you have to drop out especially when its the olympic games so many people have worked so hard to get me here
5132572 in some ways its almost quicker to keep going because if you stop youre just left out there on your own
5132573 they couldnt have been better conditions when i started to struggle i got a lot of traffic and that was annoying i was getting lots of fumes as well as everything else
5132574 a pain came up into my calves it wasnt a sharp pain if it had been like when the stress fracture was bad i would just have stopped i felt like i was just running on one leg

5132579 this realistically is my final chance at an olympic medal and i want to use that as the burning motivation for the race
5132580 i hope we do some damage kick some russian butt i hope it fires them up because we are pretty fired up over

5132586 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5132587 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5132588 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5132589 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5132590 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up

5132608 theres so much emotions going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom

5132610 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit

5132615 he was a real selfless pioneer who would push the envelope in art and technology without great expectations of returns

5132617 the greenhouse mafia in australia are in canberra and in full flight
5132618 what theyre trying to do is protect australias coal exports whilst at the same time denying the potential to develop sophisticated exports in manufacturing renewable energy
5132619 i think they the government must be feeling under pressure on this issue because theres not one authority which really supports the retention of this target now that the decision has been made to introduce an emissions trading scheme
5132620 its an election promise but there must be other ways that that can be dealt with
5132621 the reality is that renewable energy technology programs also drive improvements in efficiency in generation so theyre driving the price down
5132622 no visible flaws in her person equating to flawless teeth flawless skin
5132623 i think there is not enough understanding of the fact that in a democracy how you treat the security of the minority must be a very important part for the success of a democracy you cant only make token gestures and actually let them be in the state that they are as the rajinder sachar committee report shows so what happened is token gestures are made but real issues are never addressed
5132624 i wanted to buy a flat in bombay and it wasnt given to me because i was a muslim and i read the same about saif ali khan now i mean if javed akhtar and shabana azmi cannot get a flat in bombay because they are muslims then what are we talking about
5132625 thats why i am so distressed over what is happening in kashmir for heavens sake it should be brought to a stop and it should have been brought to a stop right when they started that nonsense
5132626 if you are muslim you cant buy a flat in mumbai period

5132630 in the next few months growers will be informed of their water allocation for the 2008 2009 growing season
5132631 with water supply at critical levels there is every indication that this allocation will not increase from last year and in some cases it may be less
5132632 research shows that it is possible to grow profitable crops on reduced water supplies but management systems must change
5132633 growers need to know more about the exact water they need how to access additional irrigation water and understand more about the allocation decision making process
5132634 they also need to know about how to maintain the long term health of their vineyard
5132635 having more knowledge about the market empowers growers to make more strategic decisions
5132636 we are all proud to be a part of something as special as this
5132637 i just saw my mom and my sister and we all had a little cry together

5132641 in our relationship with the north there always exists the possibility of localized conflict so we cannot afford to loosen our readiness
5132642 it is quite nonsensical for the u s to offer a handshake to its dialogue partner while holding a dagger in its other hand
5132643 during the second world war an estimated 10 000 children were born in norway out of liaisons between occupying german soldiers and local women the nazis had set up special lebensborn homes where these liaisons could take place and where single mothers and their babies could stay after the war life became hell for most of these norwegian women and their children
5132644 people have died moved out of state or make too much money to qualify after all those things the number becomes much smaller

5132647 it is shameful that thousands of people were forcibly removed from their homes and this legislation provides some specifics for people who were adversely affected

5132664 none of our databases talk to each other easily our main organizational database is great for development and accounting but is terrible for communications and field organizing we have to pry out information to compare data so we dont have an accurate count of how many supporters we even have names and addresses for you get different answers depending on who you ask in the organization because everyone runs their queries differently

5132671 the printing industry is the single largest air polluter and the third largest consumer of fossil fuels in the world after automobiles and steel manufacturing

5132673 your constituency your board and the foundations you work with will look to see if theres coherence in the way you walk the talk
5132674 every point of contact with your constituency should reinforce the idea that you are not only saying the right things but doing the right things printing is a very visible part of that particularly for a membership organization doing the right thing environmentally and then advertising it goes a long way toward establishing the integrity and sincerity of your organization its a wonderful way to underscore your mission

5132676 when recycled paper first came on the market it was rather brownish
5132677 today it is nearly indistinguishable from virgin fiber papers i hung up two pieces of paper one recycled pcw and the other virgin fiber in a gallery side by side no one could tell the difference even better when printed on both papers perform equally well however the myth still persists that recycled pcw papers contain seeds are brown and are of lower quality this is simply untrue
5132678 the biggest deterrent to printing green is lack of information
5132679 it is cost efficient to make recycled paper as it requires less energy than virgin
5132680 there is often a slightly higher premium for recycled paper that is largely based on supply and demand issues the more we request recycled pcw paper the more the paper industry will supply and costs will even out printers pollute and pollute badly why should this be ok choosing to not support those practices is to vote with your dollar

5132682 also combining projects whenever possible is wise one idea is to print business cards and postcards from the same recycled paper

5132699 the fact is that although we have a president who is opposed to abortion over the last eight years abortions have not gone down
5132700 politicians from hillary clinton and john kerry to howard dean have recently contended that abortions have increased since george w bush took office in 2001
5132701 this claim is false its based on an opinion piece that used data from only 16 states a study by the alan guttmacher institute of 43 states found that abortions have actually decreased
5132702 i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade

5132709 our intent with windows 7 and the pre release communication is to make sure that we have a reasonable degree of con dence in what we talk about when we do talk related to disclosure is the idea of how we make sure not to set expectations around the release that end up disappointing you features that dont make it claims that dont stick or support we dont provide

5132857 when i say christianity is essentially a social religion i mean not only that it cannot subsist so well but that it cannot subsist at all without society without living and conversing with other men
5132858 he played for how many plays after that so chances are he could have you still want to always be able to protect yourself so thats always kind of the litmus for us
5132859 i sense that hes getting a pretty good feel of what were doing systematically
5132860 it is without question the best weekend britain has had at an olympics
5132861 and it is testament to how far we have come in improving our levels of performance perhaps the key to it is the support we can give our athletes now and 1996 played a key part in that change
5132862 for the last three years all anybody has been talking about has been london london london
5132863 that has focussed minds the boa has stepped up the government has increased its support and the many of the sports have raised their games too
5132864 it is not just a case of home advantage its what theyve been doing in preparation for the last seven years in their case longer as they thought they were going to get the 2000 games
5132865 that stretch wont be quite to uncomfortable and moynihan is adamant the good times arent quite over yet in china sailing regatta has a long way to go there are still medals to be won in the cycling and were confident of success in lots of other sports too its by no means over
5132866 our athletes coaches and support staff should be proud of their achievements
5132867 at the start of the games one of our ambitions was to achieve around
5132868 we still have another week of great sport to look forward to then we can start to think about how we can build on beijing towards london 2012 and beyond
5132869 to begin with let us take the following motto literature is love now we can continue
5132870 i can be changed by what happens to me but i refuse to be reduced by it
5132871 style is knowing who you are what you want to say and not giving a damn
5132872 perfume is like love you can never get enough of it
5132873 yesterday is history tomorrow is mystery today is a gift
5132874 no one can make you feel inferior without your consent
5132875 someone said hey we won we just swept a series
5132876 i think it broke the ice and loosened some guys up
5132877 everybody knows how our bullpen has been overworked so its nice if we can go out and pitch more than six innings
5132878 hes going to have to fight through it everybody goes through periods where they struggle a little bit
5132879 and still you watch me wash away and maybe well come back some day float down stream catch your wings
5132880 i felt great on the front nine then started the back nine with two bogeys
5132881 my caddie gave me a great read on 12 and i made a long putt for par and that kind of turned things around that was a momentum swing there and i played solid coming in
5132882 i was born in sweden but only lived there for 10 years
5132883 i know im swedish but this is home to me ive really enjoyed the crowds this week its been fantastic to win my home tournament is unbelievable
5132884 como partido gen hemos sido reconocidos a nivel nacional y comenzamos una campa a de afiliaci n para constituir de el partido pol tico que forma parte de la colaci n c vica carri stolbizer para poder fortalecernos a n m s
5132885 hoy vemos como una desidia una falta de gesti n en numerosos temas que involucran a la ciudad y tambi n a los organismos provinciales y nacionales da la sensaci n que se ha perdido el rumbo y que no se resuelven los problemas en su profundidad
5132886 nos preocupa que en la provincia de buenos aires el gobernador daniel scioli hable solamente de generalidades y no resuelva los problemas de los bonaerenses que son muy profundos
5132887 ac hay evidentemente un matrimonio pol tico entre pulti y scioli que marca a las claras como est la situaci n en la ciudad donde los problemas verdaderos no se resuelven
5132888 es la de controlar a la gesti n del intendente no por eso no dejamos de estar atentos a los temas que reclama la ciudad como la exclusi n que se vive en diferentes mbitos luchamos por aquellos que est n en desigualdad social y pedimos que realmente este conurbano marplatense que se ha creado tenga un poco m s de inclusi n

5132890 la gente arriba con una expectativa que lamentablemente ac no se les va a poder solucionar y desde la provincia tampoco atento a aquella falta de resoluci n de los verdaderos problemas del pueblo bonaerense

5132905 am i willing to waste my energy further on this matter
5132906 cut them some slack after what they did to me never
5132907 giving up the resentment to which you are entitled and offering to the person who hurt you friendlier attitudes to which they are not entitled
5132908 forgiveness means deciding not to punish a perceived injustice taking action on that decision and experiencing the emotional relief that follows
5132909 we have come from a distant country make a treaty with us
5132910 but perhaps you live near us how then can we make a treaty with you
5132911 your servants have come from a very distant country because of the fame of the lord your god
5132912 thanks to all the wonderful media and press in the maryland region we are hopeful that tomorrow nights fashion spectacular will be a success for echelon life

5132916 if taking vacations apart is good for a marriage maybe spending
5132917 but by the final panel hes looking very very sad indeed
5132918 damn it its awkward enough avoiding sexual advances from my wife i dont want to have to deal with this at work too
5132919 and i recall what a key hillary clinton fundraiser and aide said to me at the start of the primary campaign we cannot make our strongest case against him america is not going to elect a black man
5132920 this is one of those 3 a m moments how would a president obama be different from bush
5132921 traditionally we have seen that the russians will push and push until they meet opposition and what they need to understand is that all european countries and the united states are united in opposing the latest russian moves which is really the culmination of years of what theyve been doing
5132922 i think first of all the administration has said very clearly and publicly that there will be no trade offs trade offs like that are kind of a relic of a bygone era of power politics
5132923 as mrs clinton campaigned in wisconsin in advance of the primary there on tuesday one of her top advisers howard wolfson convened a conference call with reporters to accuse mr obama of plagiarizing mr patricks remarks from a 2006 campaign appearance mr wolfson said it was important for voters to know that mr obamas rhetoric at least in this instance was not original
5132924 the fact is that obamas economic plan today is the most shameless piece of potential plagiarism that i have ever seen he basically took clintons words and clintons policies and called them his own if i were a professor id give him an f and try to get him kicked out of school for something this terrible if i were on the clinton team id be prepping memos kevin a hassett senior fellow and director of economic policy studies american enterprise institute
5132925 i served with sen mccain and he and i were the only two to vote against the bush cheney tax cuts
5132926 during this campaign it is a different john mccain he is saying he would make the tax cuts permanent he is advocating more drilling whereas he voted against drilling in anwr it goes to his credibility and that is such an important issue for this country plus his foreign policy has been consistently with bush cheney and i know from my perspective that is a huge issue for the united states
5132927 i think the little flare up we are witnessing in georgia is another illustration of the different approach these two men are taking
5132928 mccain is bellicose threatening to kick russia out of the g8 use force if it is required obama is far more of the traditional position turn to international institutions call for reconciliation call for an end of hostilities but also be firm in his words and thats the kind of leadership we need
5132929 lets just squeak in as the marginally more preferable centrist
5132930 what difference does it make to the dead the orphans and the homeless whether the mad destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism or the holy name of liberty or democracy
5132931 all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
5132932 democratic sen mary landrieu who faces a tough re election has had her name removed from a fundraiser announcement for presidential candidate barack obama
5132933 clark started the bombings codenamed operation allied force on march 24 1999 on orders to try and enforce un resolution 1199 following yugoslavias refusal of the rambouillet agreement however critics note that resolution 1199 was a call for cessation of hostilities and does not authorize any organization to take military action
5132934 this command conflict came to a ceremonial head when clark was not initially invited to a summit in washington d c to commemorate natos 50th anniversary despite being its supreme military commander clark eventually secured an invitation to the summit but was told by cohen to say nothing about ground troops and clark agreed
5132935 the hypocrisy of the international community knows no bounds for if the west forced the issue of kosovar independence then the independence of south ossetia should also be on the cards
5132936 thousands of other republicans are going to be picking country over party in this election
5132937 the mccain campaign relies on big money lobbyists and theyll rely on him
5132938 in the you scratch my back world of washington 931 million gets the special interests the best government money can buy but just think of the payday these lobbyists might expect in a mccain administration
5132939 if you were a cheap whore you think id have put you up at the westin
5132940 that must be a girl thing guys dont care about that shit
5132941 do you want to go to the beach or the gaslamp

5132945 the czech game is important because i hope to get the answers from the players i expect
5132946 i had about one run where i felt like i could move around on the track a little bit but other than that we were either way too loose or too tight to come out of here with 12th isnt that bad all things considered

5132949 i think its serious its a serious situation but theres a lot of things we need to do we have a lot of work to do and im afraid its a very hard struggle particularly given the situation on the iraq pakistan border
5132950 fact checking a book like this one can require extensive labor and time from independent journalists whose work often trails behind the media echo chamber
5132951 several of the books accusations in fact are unsubstantiated misleading or inaccurate
5132952 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far more so than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
5132953 i think that choice and gay rights are personal things particularly if you are a conservative the government should get out of the bedroom
5132954 comrades in arms making much of that books claims based on first hand facts
5132955 a new best selling book by the co author of the 2004 book that falsely accused john kerry of exaggerating his vietnam war record contains significant allegations about barack obama that are false according to an extensive times review of the charges
5132956 detroit mayor kwame kilpatrick rode another legal roller coaster yesterday as he was granted permission by one judge to travel to the democratic national convention in denver only to have another rescind the privilege hours later the judge in the morning removed kilpatricks electronic tether the judge in the afternoon ordered it back on
5132957 honolulu reuters barack obamas presidential campaign said on thursday a potential hike in payroll taxes for wealthy americans under an obama administration would not occur for 10 years while taxes on dividends and capital gains would be capped at 20 percent
5132958 the opinion piece that we saw today in the wall street journal is part of a path that obamas taking which takes him back more towards the middle more towards mccains policies
5132959 i am helping him with fundraising we have a fundraiser today and i will be with him today and tomorrow
5132960 if you look at folks of color even women theyre more successful in the democratic party than they are in the white uh excuse me in the laughs republican party
5132961 i have never seen anyone so completely without any commitment to any particular principle and so willing to say whatever he thinks will help him win the next election
5132962 frank has long been a vocal critic of romney and has been a controversial figure himself he is an openly gay member of congress who was formally reprimanded by congress in 1990 for his relationship with a male prostitute who claimed to run an escort service out of franks apartment when he was not home
5132963 sanchez says shes happy for the chance to vote for hillary rodham clinton at the democratic national convention and she predicts that as many as half of the democrats in the house could join her
5132964 another new york delegate speaking on condition of anonymity predicted that as much as 30 percent to 40 percent of the new york delegation would pick clinton over obama during the symbolic vote
5132965 whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5132966 and so for me the goal right now should be and this is where i think we can find common ground and by the way ive now inserted this into the democratic party platform is how do we reduce the number of abortions because the fact is that although weve had a president who is opposed to abortions the last eight years abortions have not gone down
5132967 that last statement is incorrect abortions are actually at their lowest rate since 1975 and dropped nine percent between 2000 and 2005 thus far only fox news made a note of this
5132968 was a writer with unusual gifts utterly devoted to his art brilliant and exacting producing work that would stun not just literary worlds but the entire cold war political world
5132969 these networks are well embedded in some of these countries
5132970 were going to have to prove to them that we are very serious and the price that they will pay will not only be for punishment but also deterrence
5132971 basically what john mccains done is hes hired the same old folks who brought you george w bush same team and its the same strategy
5132972 they dont have something positive to say about what theyre going to do for america what they try to do is they say well this other guy hes unpatriotic or this other guy he likes french people thats what they said about john kerry
5132973 they try to make it out like somehow democrats arent tough enough or arent macho enough thats their strategy and they do it every four years
5132974 and then you end up with what weve got right now ive got news for john mccain my plans not going to bring about economic disaster we already have economic disaster because of john mccains president george w bush
5132975 in that situation theres a high likelihood the patient would die from the melanoma
5132976 from whom exactly does this nation need to be secured
5132977 election will be won in the middle by attracting independents
5132978 hes not a detail person hes not a liar i think he just cant believe that he would ever do anything wrong he would think that would be some kind of moral failing and he just figures theres got to be something that isnt right with what the other person said
5132979 the muslims have said either we kneel or theyre going to kill us
5132980 i dont intend to kneel and i dont advocate to anybody that we kneel and john doesnt advocate to anybody that we kneel
5132981 i predict that they will make an attempt as we get in to the election season to make more of these spectacular kinds of attacks which theyre still capable of doing
5132982 the suicide bombers et cetera would not surprise me and weve already found out that theyre going to try and step up their attacks and try and do things in a more spectacular fashion so that they can erode the support of the maliki government
5132983 could i mention the presence of my friend congressman steve pearce who i believe will be joining me in the united states senate applause steve thank you
5132984 i supported hillary clinton and am proud and pleased that i did
5132985 all those bloggers from california where are they going to go vote for mccain
5132986 hes not a liar i think he just cant believe that he would ever do anything wrong he would think that would be some kind of moral failing and he just figures theres got to be something that isnt right with what the other person said
5132987 his approval rating is hovering about the 30 mark in most polls about as low as harry trumans back in the day
5132988 unless someone runs a 60 minute marathon or pole vaults clean out of the birds nest you can consider nominations for the athlete of the beijing olympics well and truly closed

5132994 this used to be our territory this is our territory and this will be our territory in future
5132995 it will be part of an independent country within the russian federation
5132996 these are the mountains that have always surrounded georgia and protected it from invaders its been like that for centuries now im sad i dont have any desire to join an association with russia
5132997 we did perform some cleaning operations we were looking for fighters
5132998 why are you journalists not reporting about the civilians killed in the georgian attack on tskhinvali we have georgian soldiers whose bodies have been lying there a week their government doesnt care about them
5132999 this is a very beautiful place no wonder russia wants it
5133000 this place is peaceful nobody needs to be afraid but if there are problems we have lots of tanks
5133001 it appears the uc is attempting to secularize private religious schools
5133002 confirms that uc may apply the same admissions standards to all students and to all high schools without regard to their religious affiliations
5133003 any instance of gods guidance of history or any alternative to evolution
5133004 instructs that the bible is the unerring source for analysis of historical events
5133005 if scientific conclusions contradict the word of god the conclusions are wrong
5133006 we evaluate the courses to see whether they prepare these kids to come to college at uc
5133007 there was no evidence that these students were in fact denied the ability to come to the university
5133008 im now in tottenham but no one can disagree with me wanting to follow my dream
5133009 we have two more weeks until the end of the transfer window and i think this will be the most important week i read alex fergusons statement that he wants another striker and i hope that this striker is dimitar berbatov
5133010 if i had been laughing when i was on the bench people would say i was an idiot
5133011 i see him as a pawn being used by many people with many unknown agendas anyone getting that much money has to have a lot of weight behind him and owe an awful lot of favors
5133012 the event is a legitimate target for voter interest and media scrutiny
5133013 colonel macfarland was contacted by one of the major sunni sheiks
5133014 because of the surge we were able to go out and protect that sheik and others and it began the anbar awakening
5133015 if you had to do it over again knowing what you know now would you support the surge
5133016 no because keep in mind that question you wouldnt but keep in mind that kind of hypothetical is very difficult to know hindsight is 20 20 later but i think that what im absolutely convinced of is that at that time we had to change the political debate because the view of the bush administration at that time was one that i just disagreed with
5133017 jerusalem will remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided
5133018 it will be impossible to make progress on serious peace talks without putting the future of jerusalem on the table
5133019 gaffe after gaffe after gaffe come from john mccain and they are forgotten there is no way barack obama would be able to get away with something like this
5133020 mccains mistakes raise a serious if uncomfortable question are the gaffes the result of his age and what could that mean in the oval office
5133021 washington a majority of americans think barack obama is a riskier choice for the presidency but he maintains a six point lead over republican john mccain according to the latest nbc news wall street journal poll
5133022 we do have to crack down on those employers that are taking advantage of the situation
5133023 the u s just isnt ready for a black man white woman as president yet
5133024 i understand the challenge i have and i understand that this election is really all about the people of your generation
5133025 maliki thinks that obama is most likely to win in the presidential election
5133026 hes got to take preemptive steps before obama gets to the white house
5133027 keep in mind also that maliki has no military experience and that he has been trapped in the green zone relatively isolated from day to day life for these reasons he has been a consistent font of misguided predictions about how quickly u s forces could leave
5133028 of course if the iraq government tells us to leave we will have to leave
5133029 i find it interesting that prime minister maliki is now the person to go to
5133030 who would you rather see elected as the next president of the united states
5133031 this is a clear choice that the american people have i had the courage and the judgment to say i would rather lose a political campaign than lose a war it seems to me that obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
5133032 several people including former clinton speechwriter david kusnet and later vassar professor donald foster correctly identified klein as the novels author based on a literary analysis of the book and kleins previous writing klein denied authoring the book and publicly condemned foster klein denied authorship again in newsweek speculating that another writer wrote it washington post style editor david von drehle in an interview asked klein if he was willing to stake his journalistic credibility on his denial to which klein agreed he later admitted that the speculation was correct
5133033 i would rather speak at a rally or a political gathering any place outside of the country after i am president of the united states
5133034 but thats a judgment that sen obama and the american people will make
5133035 he also urged other nations to do more to help
5133036 my ability to lead as president to keep up with these major issues
5133037 princeton nj gallup poll daily tracking of national registered voters presidential election preferences finds barack obama with a slight advantage over john mccain 45 to 43
5133038 oh what to do when the results of that election produce inconvenient consequences
5133039 an analysis of federal records shows that the amount of money journalists contributed so far this election cycle favors democrats by a 15 1 ratio over republicans with 225 563 going to democrats only 16 298 to republicans two hundred thirty five journalists donated to democrats just 20 gave to republicans a margin greater than 10 to 1 an even greater disparity 20 to 1 exists between the number of journalists who donated to barack obama and john mccain
5133040 he could only bring two or three of his senate staff member no campaign officials or workers
5133041 obama could not bring any media only military photographers would be permitted to record obamas visit
5133042 he obama was more than welcome we were all ready for him
5133043 say what you will about the surge which does indeed deserve a share of the credit for reducing violence and increasing security in baghdad but it wasnt related to either the shia standown or the sunni awakening since both began before patraeus took over in iraq american troops played a role in the sadr ceasefire and especially the awakening but the surge itself didnt and without them the surge would certainly have failed obama has it exactly right
5133044 because his visit is official only senator obama may not be accompanied by members of his campaign staff
5133045 he may only be accompanied by one member of his senate staff and the appropriate number of security personnel
5133046 while at lrmc landstuhl regional medical center senator obama may not address the media to make a campaign or election related statement or to respond to a campaign or a campaign related event
5133047 oh america is just not ready for a black man president
5133048 you tell us can america elect a black man president
5133049 people are still circulating petitions on her behalf but this is a done deal
5133050 experience dont mean diddlysquat if somebody has intelligence and good judgement
5133051 obamas rhetoric is soaring but shallow woefully short on specifics and all his specific proposals will clearly cost billions but contain no clue as to how theyll be paid for ladies and gentleman that means higher taxes
5133052 obama says hes for change in washington but his change more spending and more taxes sounds like the problem not the solution
5133053 does obama have the sort of adviser a candidate most needs someone sufficiently unenthralled to tell him when he has worked one pedal on the organ too much if so obama should be told enough already with the we are who we have been waiting for rhetorical cotton candy that elevates narcissism to a political philosophy
5133054 the u s energy department estimates that every pound per square inch of
5133055 the facts are easy enough to find unless youd rather parrot wingnut bullshyt
5133056 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
5133057 the biggest thing is getting comfortable with the quarterback that plays a huge part in your development as a receiver especially in training camp
5133058 even if i make a good play or run a good route i still have to ask the quarterback questions about the way he wants it done ultimately hes going to throw the ball to the guy he feels most comfortable with
5133059 with us being so young a lot of people are questioning us we cant worry about that
5133060 you know why youre here the only thing we can worry about is coming out here and working hard and doing every little possible thing to help this team win
5133061 the main thing is reading the coverages and understanding what youre doing in the offense
5133062 every receiver from top to bottom has made great strides
5133063 when i was in that juncture of my career i didnt think i was going to do much more than be a backup to superman
5133064 he goes down and i had an opportunity to excel
5133065 these guys are in a similar position weve got a group of young hungry guys who want to prove themselves and earn a check for years to come theyve got a lot at stake so i know theyre going to give it all theyve got
5133066 this fram top fuel dragster is running good the car is consistent and the guys are doing a great job
5133067 we kind of went for it and tried something different during the friday night session and i think it hurt us qualifying wise that friday night run is normally so very important but were trying to get ready to do some stuff from indy on because were locked into the countdown
5133068 the points still matter and wed like to move up but i guess we have to do our own dirty work tomorrow and take out antron brown in the first round since he is ahead of us in the points no 2
5133069 hopefully larry dixon no 3 in the points goes out early and we can go some rounds but those guys are tough over there and were both matco tools cars
5133070 were going to go out there and try and win the first round tomorrow and take it from there the fram dragster has been very consistent and we havent lost in round one for quite a while so my job is to go out there tomorrow and make sure we dont lose in the first round again
5133071 it was a decent run for this interstate batteries toyota
5133072 i felt like it was way better and far better than what it was here in the spring we ran up front all day long and that was nice to see we made gains and got a lot better from what we had at the start of the race but we just didnt have enough for the 99 carl edwards there at the end
5133073 we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys today
5133074 it just came down to when he beat us off pit road that was it for us we were good there on one set of tires and then that was pretty much all we had steve addington made great calls all day long and the guys gave me a great car to be able to come home second we werent that competitive here in the spring so im glad to come out of here with something to build on
5133075 my policy is that if they lose their key the fee is 50 i have the list of the codes so i can call the locksmith and give her the code and the tenants name the tenant can then go and pick it up during their regular business hours
5133076 you come here as a politician of course but these are really folks in many cases ive grown up with in my home county its kind of a relaxing afternoon
5133077 its a great event every year i come and obviously were here to see a lot of old friends and hopefully a few new were working hard on this campaign trail
5133078 its all fun but this is more fun you have your family and friends here and the entire republican committee
5133079 there will be no more flowers sent my loved ones are getting giant fortune cookies from now on
5133080 with photoshop elements im able to capture memories that are very special to me in my life and create beautiful works of art
5133081 palm centro has the power of a broadband smartphone at the price of a standard 12 key phone
5133082 we picked up where we left off friday and had two great runs today
5133083 we felt we had a chance to improve in round 3 this morning and we did jumping up to eighth place
5133084 even though we fell back to 11th im really really pleased with todays progress the car is very drivable and there is room for us to improve a touch sunday morning we did slip a new motor between the rails today and it was very happy by q4
5133085 its been proven time and again that anyone in the field can win the race on sunday
5133086 v is always a tough guy to race and he has a great car but were pretty good too so well get after it and see what happens
5133087 wed love to get another win before the playoffs start this is an important race for us because its close enough to home and its a track were very familiar with weve raced a lot of different times here in a lot of different cars
5133088 hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants
5133089 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile
5133090 saying mwanawasas illness has not had any impact on the economy is denying to accept reality everyone is nervous i am not only talking about the citizens of this country but investors as well for them it has now became a wait and see situation before they can pour in their investments into this country
5133091 demand and supply are playing a serious role on the market so from an economic point of view its not easy to attribute the kwachas depreciation to rumours surrounding the presidents health because there is a high foreign currency on the local market
5133092 this government should show leadership especially that president levy mwanawasa is currently in hospital it is imperative for vice president rupiah banda to show true leadership on this matter
5133093 we will not stop fighting this matter until the bills are withdrawn this is the time for zambians to unite on a matter that will affect their lives once it is approved
5133094 to award themselves these hefty salaries is highly immoral and irresponsibility of the highest order we are here to speak for the people who cant speak for themselves government should show accountability in the manner this country is being run
5133095 i say let me go and search for some food
5133096 in my grandfathers time there was rain in my fathers time there was rain
5133097 but now the rain is decreasing and decreasing and decreasing so there is nothing to eat
5133098 issue well meaning edicts such as increase food production 30 in your district
5133099 the situation on the ground is known by everybody we are working transparently and closely with our partners
5133100 all the stars are aligned now and the situation is stabilized
5133101 we dont need to beat the drum of hunger for ethiopia every year

5133105 tras haber mantenido en varias ocasiones conversaciones con la familia de don adolfo su rez para rendirle homenaje comunic ndole esta que no era el momento adecuado para ello pero ante las peticiones recibidas por distintas v as considera que ha llegado el momento para que cebreros le rinda el merecido homenaje
5133106 se est construyendo en un terreno calificado en parte como zona verde
5133107 lo primero es devolver la confianza a los ciudadanos es lo b sico
5133108 david sabe que todo el pueblo conoce su historia de oposici n a barrientos
5133109 l aprovecha esa inercia para legitimar su pol tica agresiva
5133110 no olvidemos que l era portavoz mientras se firmaban convenios bajo sospecha
5133111 cada alcalde tiene su pol tica de altos cargos barrientos ten a una yo otra
5133112 hay dos versiones de lo que ocurri una dice que fueron se alados por tirar piedras a un paso de semana santa la otra dice que eran muy reivindicativos en la f brica de resina donde trabajaban y lideraron una revuelta el 1 de mayo esa teor a coincide con la hip tesis de que los que le encargaron a el blas el paseo fueron los hijos del patr n de la f brica
5133113 por un lado agradecemos esa ayuda pero estoy decepcionado con la cobard a de jos luis rodr guez zapatero
5133114 s lo pedimos ojo con lo que voy a decir lo que ya hizo franco con sus muertos
5133115 no est haciendo una lectura adecuada del resultado de las urnas del 10 de agosto y est asumiendo una posici n radical que lo nico que quiere es general violencia y m s violencia
5133116 nos hace retrotraer al 19 de agosto de 1971 golpe de hugo banzer su rez y de los radicales de la fbs que planificaron desde santa cruz los grupos radicales asaltaron el poder y se quedaron siete a os en una dictadura militar
5133117 ese pueblo tiene que mantenerse vigilante porque no podemos permitir que 25 a os de democracia se lo quieran llevar adelante un grupo de radicales recordando ese 19 de agosto de 1971
5133118 si el l der y principal autoridad de santa cruz llama a la violencia insulta y menoscaba la autoridad del presidente qu se puede esperar de los otros radicales
5133119 no es la primera vez es un corolario de muchas agresiones que se hicieron desde los grupos de choque y ahora parece que est n arremetiendo contra la voluntad del pueblo expresada el 10 de agosto
5133120 porque de lo contrario lo que est haciendo es llevar a la exacerbaci n de la violencia en la ciudad de santa cruz con consecuencias que l tendr que responder porque l es el instigador y el armador principal de estos violentos
5133121 hay que exhortar a costas que asuma el resultado democr tico de las urnas que no le han dicho que vaya a la guerra y la confrontaci n ni ponga escudos a la uni n juvenil cruce ista s lo falta que le ponga cascos y armas de fuego

5133125 the russian officer threatened to arrest an associated press photographer if he took pictures and would not give his name
5133126 german stalinism is collapsing less under the blows of the fascists than because of its own internal decomposition just as a physician does not abandon a sick man as long as he has a breath of life our responsibility was to try to reform it while the least hope remained but it would be criminal to stay tied to a corpse and the kpd is only a corpse
5133127 quite obviously our turning point does not consist in our proclaiming ourselves the new party that is out of the question but we say the official german party is politically liquidated it was not able to revive we do not wish to inherit its crimes the vanguard of the german workers must set it up we bolshevik leninists offer them our collaboration

5133203 pgachtig jonge maer heb je al auver je toekomstige carri hre naegedach
5133204 dat kun je niet eens een beroep noemen ik dacht dat we overeengekomen waren dat je fysika zou gaan studeren

5133208 och k wait nait jong hest gain tied veur kompjoeters en zukswat en ook gain senten t is aaltied moar knooien en pezen en pokkelen
5133209 nou dus iets over maain persoon ik heb een kroieniersbedraaifie in mokem en ik ben op weg naar alaska om wat koopwaar in te slaan gewoon voor de saak voel je wel kreefte verpatse die gabbers daar voor een krats een van die grote kiste vol vaaifteg euro meneer o ja en me naam is daaikhois
5133210 nee je spreekt t verkeer oit mn naam is geen daaikhois t is daaikhois ik zal t effe opschraaive
5133211 primo mijn naam is antonio spagettino en ik kom van milano sinds kort na mijn bambino tijd rook ik sigaren en speel poker met andere sigaar rokende italianos om onze obscure doelen te bereiken werken wij veel met geweren
5133212 maar vind je die werkwijze niet een beetje eh ja hoe zal ik het zeggen radikaal
5133213 ik schoot ook altijd mis mijn papa zei vaak je leert t nooit je bent een fiasco bambino maar toen ik van signora knollo hoorde dat je ook kan werken voor geld dacht ik das fantastico daarom ga ik een baantje zoeken zo gauw als ik kan
5133214 straatveger dat is echt de baan van mijn dromen of zanger in di opera
5133215 maar nu eens anderswat ik heb in geen twintig jaar een mens gezien en nu opeens wel honderd vertel eens hoe raken jullie hier in vredesnaam zo verzeild
5133216 als jongeling van negen had ik er al schik in om boeken in de rechtsgeleerdheid te bestuderen
5133217 derhalve bezocht ik een een aantal jaren daarna de rijks universiteit te groningen en voor ik het wist was ik advocaat ik verdedigde dieven koppensnellers en moordenaars althans dat werd van mij verwacht maar meestal viel er niet veel te verdedigen moord is moord nietwaar
5133218 mijn cli nten schenen niet zo tevreden te zijn met mijn werkwijze merkwaardig eigenlijk
5133219 vaak stonden ze mij naar het leven als ik hun bezocht in hun opmerkelijk ingerichte cellen na verloop van tijd werd mijn client le steeds maar kleiner en kleiner tot er uiteindelijk niets meer over was
5133220 nu had ik na wat literair onderzoek ontdekt dat de sahara bijzonder vruchtbaar moet zijn daarom reisde ik naar afrika voor wat meer research en toevallig vond ik dit plekje juist wat ik zocht zoals jullie zien heb ik me hier gevestigd en tot nu toe niet onverdienstelijk geboerd
5133221 moar is dat nou nait ainzoam meneer zo allaain in d sahoaroa
5133222 ik heb natuurlijk constanze mn poes een uitstekend gesprekspartner hoor daar niet van begaafd luisteraarster ook maar ik had graag iets meer feedback van haar gewild weet je na een paar jaar heb je aan een enkele miauw niet meer genoeg daarom vind ik het zo aardig jullie hier te hebben wil er nog iemand koffie
5133223 jazeker maar eigenlijk maak ik zelf geen gebruik van het toestel want hier in de sahara is het maar dunnetjes bevolkt
5133224 en mn familie en bekenden in nederland kan ik ook niet bereiken
5133225 want de ptt heeft me merkwaardig genoeg nooit een telefoonboek gestuurd hebben ze zeker vergeten
5133226 officieel moet ik hun laten weten waar we zijn maar dat zou betekenen morgen weer achter de knuppel en daar voel ik niet veel voor daarom hoopte ik dat van der waerdt geen telefoon had
5133227 katrien doe nou eens niet zo vervelend en blijf van die telefoon af
5133228 morgenavond komt mn vriend chevon en die wil ik niet graag voor een dicht flatje laten staan ik heb hem nu al in vijf dagen niet gezien en ik begin echt onze fijne gesprekken te missen
5133229 ik wil hier minstens een week blijven en voor fijne gesprekken kun je wel bij mij terecht
5133230 h nou kin t wel weer he schoamst die nait
5133231 bedaar toch eens wat ik geloof dat ik een oplossing heb
5133232 we kenne nou eenmaal nie met de benewage of met de blarewage in maain geval ha ha ha
5133233 als jullie met alle geweld weg willen kunnen jullie mijn kamelen wel lenen om zo in de bewoonde wereld te komen drie lichte passagiers per kameel zal wel lukken en de beesten weten de weg zelf heb ik het nooit geprobeerd maar ik weet hoe intelligent ze zijn en na jullie terug in de beschaving geholpen te hebben komen ze hopelijk deze kant wel weer op maar hou er rekening mee dat jullie ongetwijfeld veel ontberingen te wachten staan
5133234 juffrouw katrien wil dus weg en wat wil de rest

5133280 i have enjoyed my time with the wallabies immensely and there is still much to be done over the next few months
5133281 we are in the midst of a tri nations campaign and have a six match tour to hong kong and europe
5133282 looking further ahead what this opportunity with the waratahs provides is an appealing opportunity to be at home more frequently
5133283 with four children thats very important to me and my family the travel demands over the past three seasons have been extensive
5133284 michaels been working hard with our forwards for some time now and weve seen the results in the waratahs set piece play and scrummaging in particular
5133285 during the super 14 michael was a familiar face around the place so to know that weve got him full time now is a major coup for nsw rugby
5133286 michaels contribution to the wallabies over the past three years cannot be underestimated
5133287 today i was very very nervous because i was the favourite to win the tournament
5133288 in a final if you play your best you can win for sure but i think today i played more with my mind than my body
5133289 i am pretty sad that maybe i could not be quite at 100 percent today but he played great winning another title
5133290 this camp is good opportunity for us to see the players after their off season break
5133291 most of the players have just started or are about to start their respective domestic competitions and we can now start focusing of the world cup qualifiers which are just around the corner
5133292 extra scrutiny and upheaval the columns brought to him and wrestling with the journalistic issues involved
5133293 are heartsick at suspicions directed against a man they regard as a patriot
5133294 must be a genuine assumption that he is an innocent man caught in a nightmare
5133295 i think i should have tried harder to find a range of other examples to underscore the incompetence of the f b i anthrax investigation
5133296 adobe flash player is the worlds most pervasive software platform used by over 2 million professionals and reaching over 98
5133297 this week a defence forensic anthropologist an archaeologist and several army historians will conduct a full archaeological dig in the location where private fisher is believed to have fallen
5133298 i am very proud of the australian armys commitment to this investigation
5133299 private fisher was a brave soldier who lost his life in service of his country and it is our duty to make every effort to locate and appropriately honour him
5133300 the australian team will work closely with vietnamese officials they know what they are looking for and now have a good indication of where to search
5133301 we are hopeful of providing private fishers family with some long awaited answers and ask on their behalf that the media respect their privacy at this sensitive time
5133302 in addition the team is undertaking a preliminary examination of records relating to the two royal australian air force personnel also missing in vietnam
5133303 i realize now how much she was just like the others cold and distant and many people are like that women for sure theyre like a union
5133304 but when you find out who did it let us know were always looking for ideas
5133305 its nice that someone by placing a sticker on an object can make it a piece of art
5133306 this particular piece of guerrilla art seems to have accomplished this lofty goal brilliantly
5133307 but i will tell you i think this is a smart and fun piece of public art
5133308 todays ceremony pays tribute to the wulgurukaba and bindal people recognising not only their connection to this land and their culture but also the long standing support theyve given and continue to give to defence in townsville
5133309 further it reflects the close cooperation and respect that exists between defence and indigenous traditional owners and ensures the redevelopment of raaf base townsville is completed with cultural sensitivity
5133310 in accordance with the directions of the bindal and wulgurukaba people the objects were relocated to a site within the project boundaries the original significant site was then marked with a small stone monument
5133311 the bindal and wulgurukaba people and defence also planned together the second monument and plaque to commemorate the indigenous land use agreement

5133325 i think quite frankly im going to have to make a judgment in the next little while as to whether or not this parliament can function productively
5133326 mr liberal leader stephane dion says he doesnt support the government but wont say whether he will defeat us or not
5133327 i expect harpers conservatives will be negative i dont think that american republican style of politics will go over well with canadians
5133328 there were the changes to the student employment programs cuts in the acoa budget and cuts in cultural heritage
5133329 i was thrown on the ground and noticed only the stalks of my flowers were left everything was still and quiet and when i got up there were people naked not saying anything some of them had no skin or hair i was certain i was dead
5133330 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
5133331 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
5133332 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
5133333 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis
5133334 a self righteous one way legal moral screen with positive images of western values and innocence portrayed as threatened validating a campaign of unrestricted violence

5133337 that set of decisions and actions which lead to the development of an effective strategy or strategies to help achieve corporate objectives

5133339 disappointment would be not making it to the final not making it out of the heats thats just ridiculous
5133340 i couldnt really get out of my bed until two days ago
5133341 i thought i was over it but it seems like it still has taken a lot out of my body
5133342 i got to one slow constant speed couldnt pick it up from there
5133343 as elite athletes we have to do a better job of self financing
5133344 instead of asking the government all the time for more money more money i think its up to us to take some responsibility to go out there and find it the corporate world is happy to come on board you just have to ask i think we should put a challenge out there to other athletes to do the same
5133345 i thought if im going to do this im going to need financial support because carding isnt going to cut it
5133346 midnight oil and daylight energy took a risk and have supported me ever since they have made the difference
5133347 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5133348 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5133349 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5133350 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5133351 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5133352 i need to be silent for a while worlds are forming in my heart
5133353 from a third person over the shoulder view with emphasis both on combat and detective work

5133355 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5133356 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

5133358 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5133359 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5133360 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5133361 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5133362 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5133363 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5133364 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5133365 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5133366 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5133367 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5133368 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5133369 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5133370 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5133371 it is a terrible fight and it is between two wolves one is evil he is anger envy sorrow regret greed arrogance self pity guilt resentment inferiority lies false pride superiority and ego

5133373 it takes ten good strokes to make up for one bad stroke this goes for physical hurts as well as emotional hurts and mental hurts

5133381 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5133382 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
5133383 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5133384 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5133385 it appears the wheels on the plane dug in and it flipped over
5133386 the plane had these big tires tundra tires i think theyre called which he uses to land in places all over northern canada
5133387 we serve 17 000 kids across east tennessee during a given day and we need all the money we can get
5133388 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5133389 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5133390 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5133391 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5133392 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5133393 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5133394 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5133395 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5133396 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5133397 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5133398 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5133399 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5133400 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5133401 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5133402 el olor que se esparci r pidamente proven a de un bulto de la bodega de equipajes

5133407 i am totally convinced that no matter how any letters may be written to newspapers by disgruntled readers no matter how many protests and confrontations may be staged even criticism from its own parliamentary party members and from its own state headquarters this incompetent nsw government takes no notice in fatc it seems to rejoice in maladministration and as it headsinot its final few years of office before it is unceremoniously kicked out into political oblivion for time immemorial lets hope the damage they inflict between now and then is only minimal this banal bunch of charlatans will go down in history as the worst most abominable administration ever inflicted on an australian electorate
5133408 excuse me sir im only 10 years old and even i know that is a lie
5133409 this is labor not listening to your constituents holding the belief that you know better and doing whatever the hell you like
5133410 what is it about michael costa anybody else who behaves in this boorish and thuggish manner would get the sack yet morris iemma lets him get away with it mr costa is a sick joke and its time for him to go
5133411 like mr iemma everything mr costa is involved in is also stuffed up and the sooner nsw voters see the back of these clowns and their fellow labor ministers the better nsw labor rotten to the core
5133412 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5133413 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5133414 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5133415 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5133416 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5133417 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5133418 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5133419 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5133420 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5133421 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5133422 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5133423 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5133424 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5133425 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena

5133428 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5133429 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5133430 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5133431 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5133432 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5133433 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5133434 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5133435 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5133436 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5133437 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5133438 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5133439 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5133440 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5133441 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5133442 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5133443 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5133444 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5133445 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5133446 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5133447 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5133448 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5133449 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5133450 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5133451 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5133452 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5133453 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5133454 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5133455 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5133456 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5133457 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5133458 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5133459 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5133460 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5133461 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5133462 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5133463 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5133464 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama

5133555 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5133556 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5133557 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
5133558 que su intenci n no fue expresar falta de respeto hacia los homosexuales sino clarificar lo que ense a la biblia sobre la homosexualidad
5133559 el crear uniones civiles para los homosexuales y mantener el matrimonio para los heterosexuales crea un estado inconstitucional inferior y discriminatorio para las parejas del mismo sexo
5133560 si alguien se acuesta con otro hombre como quien se acuesta con otra mujer comete un acto abominable y los dos ser n condenados a muerte de la cual ellos mismos ser n responsables
5133561 por eso dios los entreg a los malos deseos de sus corazones que conducen a la impureza sexual de modo que degradaron sus cuerpos los unos con los otros por tanto dios los entreg a pasiones vergonzosas en efecto las mujeres cambiaron las relaciones naturales por las que van contra la naturaleza as mismo los hombres dejaron las relaciones naturales con la mujer y se encendieron en pasiones lujuriosas los unos con los otros hombres con hombres cometieron actos indecentes y en si mismo recibieron el castigo que merec a su perversi n
5133562 no saben que los malvados no heredar n el reino de dios no se dejen enga ar ni los fornicarios ni los id latras ni los ad lteros ni los sodomitas ni los pervertidos sexuales y eso eran algunos de ustedes pero ya han sido lavados ya han sido santificados ya han sido justificados en el nombre del se or jesucristo y por el esp ritu de nuestro dios
5133563 ellos han sido heridos algunas de sus heridas han venido de nosotros les hemos llamado malos nombres los hemos alejados de nosotros como cristianos es nuestra obligaci n abrazarlos y traerlos a la iglesia no se puede alcanzar personas para cristo si no los tratamos con respeto
5133564 nuestra obligaci n es despreciar el pecado pero amar al pecador muchos hombres y mujeres que experimentan pasiones homosexuales no han buscado este modo de vida ha ocurrido por razones que no pueden recordar o explicar
5133565 cuando la homofobia reina en una iglesia somos nosotros los heterosexuales los que necesitan ser perdonados
5133566 no tenemos un sacerdote que no pueda compadecerse de nuestras debilidades
5133567 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
5133568 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
5133569 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5133570 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5133571 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
5133572 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
5133573 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

5133584 if i am president of the united states my friends if i have to follow him to the gates of hell i will get osama bin laden and bring him to justice no one should be allowed to take thousands of american innocent american lives
5133585 my father wasnt in the house i have written about this there were times where i experimented with drugs and i drank in my teenage years and what i trace this to is a certain selfishness on my part
5133586 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage

5133613 we are hoping to get into patients within the next 12 months or so
5133614 we know at the moment in rat studies that our compound inhibited the development of fibrosis and the interesting thing in the future would be to see whether we can actually reverse fibrosis
5133615 currently we have some quite strong data showing that our compounds prevent fibrosis occurring
5133616 we have looked at it in a series of animal models that are very predictive of clinical outcomes hence the reason we are quite confident that our data is robust
5133617 a lot of the remodelling or the fibrosis that occurs in patients with heart attacks causes the heart to fail over the short term
5133618 if it was the first of its kind on the market it would be a huge step forward because there are currently no anti fibrotics on the market

5133645 this is rims most significant launch since the pearl in september 2006
5133646 it is taking the blackberry platform firmly into 3g territory which is pivotal because more than any other device the smart phone benefits hugely from 3g network access
5133647 no matter what rim did the iphone was going to sell out in the first weekend
5133648 they want to put a little distance between them and the iphone
5133649 they dont have a reputation where you dont want to buy the first blackberry devices quite the opposite everyone feels quite comfortable buying the first round of blackberrys and i think they want to make sure of that
5133650 because rim is so much more deeply entrenched with blackberry in the enterprise market this kind of bullet proof rock solid reputation matters a lot more to rim than it does to apple
5133651 the market is willing to cut apple a little bit of slack whereas it will not cut rim the same degree of slack simply because we expect more from enterprise focused companies than we do from consumer focused companies
5133652 we can get a ticket to the orlando opera orlando shakespeare theater festival of orchestras orlando museum of art the broadway across america tour orlando philharmonic and the orlando ballet

5133654 this is a first of its kind offence and we will be pressing charges against all motorists who have procured duplicate licences on the sly to flout traffic rules
5133655 but in many cases the motorists never turn up to collect the licences as they have already procured a duplicate licence on the sly for rs 200 to 300
5133656 the year long anti drunken driving campaign in which around 85 000 motorists were convicted has been a success but if it needs to be effective in the long run then the rampant issuance of duplicate licence should be curtailed

5133662 there is no doubt that this has been an enormous fall from grace for a man that lived 61 years in an exemplary fashion judge sexton said
5133663 we are hoping to get into patients within the next 12 months or so
5133664 we know at the moment in rat studies that our compound inhibited the development of fibrosis and the interesting thing in the future would be to see whether we can actually reverse fibrosis
5133665 currently we have some quite strong data showing that our compounds prevent fibrosis occurring
5133666 we have looked at it in a series of animal models that are very predictive of clinical outcomes hence the reason we are quite confident that our data is robust
5133667 a lot of the remodelling or the fibrosis that occurs in patients with heart attacks causes the heart to fail over the short term
5133668 if it was the first of its kind on the market it would be a huge step forward because there are currently no anti fibrotics on the market
5133669 it would be up there with some of the blockbuster drugs like the blood pressure lowering compounds it would be a huge advance in medical knowledge
5133670 we are once again overwhelmed by the reaction to homebake and do announce that homebake 08 peace in the park has completely sold out in record time organisers said today
5133671 once again we extend our sincerest gratitude to all who have shown their support
5133672 with such intense and surprising reaction we can at least proudly proclaim that the local music industry is well and truly in a healthy shape

5133675 were in the final process and we should have it resolved within 24 or 48 hours
5133676 once the settlement is resolved and we know its all done well be the first to come out with a statement

5133682 i wrote my two films and enjoyed the two different genre of cinema comedy and issue based but sooner i realized that comedy is my forte c kkompany is a light comedy and feel good film you can say its a mix of hera pheri and munna bhai
5133683 yes im zoyas leading man i dont know how it happened but it has happened im putting on hold my next directorial venture voice from the sky to star in zoyas film

5133685 ze praten niet met elkaar of uitsluitend op verwijtende toon
5133686 nadat de talibaan waren verdreven en karzai president werd wilde ik gaan studeren aan de universiteit maar mijn ex man verbood dat
5133687 ik ben vervolgens stiekem naar het ministerie van vrouwenzaken gegaan waar ik om een scheiding heb gevraagd
5133688 het is een schande voor je familie je bent een extra mond die gevoed moet worden en een moslim zal niet snel met een vrouw trouwen die al gescheiden en geen maagd meer is
5133689 maar ik werd geslagen door mijn man zijn zoons behandelden mij als vuil
5133690 ook omdat ik een goedbetaalde baan kon krijgen bij een buitenlandse ngo
5133691 op dit moment zitten er ongeveer vijftig vrouwen die van hun mannen willen scheiden in onze opvanghuizen de dreigementen komen van hun ex echtgenoten maar ook van bijvoorbeeld hun broers in afghanistan lopen deze vrouwen een groot risico en daarom mag niemand van buiten kunnen zien waar zij verblijven
5133692 tijdens het regime van de talibaan mocht de vrouw niets niet naar buiten niet naar school en niet werken nu is dat anders
5133693 en er zijn nog steeds mannen die de vrouw in huis opsluiten en losse handen hebben
5133694 dat lijkt weinig maar het is niet gering in een maatschappij waar de vrouw jarenlang niet meetelde
5133695 vroeger had de vrouw ook geen recht op een advocaat tegenwoordig wel maar als de echtgenoot niet akkoord gaat met de scheiding wordt de zaak voorgelegd aan een rechtbank waar de sharia islamitisch recht red geldt
5133696 een vrouw die wegloopt van haar echtgenoot pleegt een strafbaar feit
5133697 als zij slecht behandeld is door haar man en ondergedoken zit bij haar familie is er geen sprake van criminaliteit maar als zij is ingetrokken bij haar minnaar wacht haar wel een gevangenisstraf overspel is strafbaar een ongelukkig getrouwde vrouw kan beter gewoon een echtscheidingsprocedure beginnen dan loopt ze ook niet de kans gearresteerd te worden

5133717 with 46 million americans without any health insurance at all and another 50 million underinsured isnt it really time to look at the other models that exist that are workable for all the other industrialized nations in the world when you think about it the only thing thats stopping us is the hold that the private insurers have on our political system
5133718 if people clearly understood that by going to vote on election day they would create conditions where they would have health coverage if you could communicate that message you wouldnt have to talk about anything else

5133720 in the next few months growers will be informed of their water allocation for the 2008 2009 growing season ms hellams said
5133721 with water supply at critical levels there is every indication that this allocation will not increase from last year and in some cases it may be less
5133722 research shows that it is possible to grow profitable crops on reduced water supplies but management systems must change she said
5133723 growers need to know more about the exact water they need how to access additional irrigation water and understand more about the allocation decision making process
5133724 they also need to know about how to maintain the long term health of their vineyard
5133725 having more knowledge about the market empowers growers to make more strategic decisions ms hellams said
5133726 its quite possible that this lack of water could persist for a long time and growers may need to look at alternative business models or vineyard management strategies

5133743 in japan the problem of vaccine associated sids was eliminated not by the introdution of acellular pertussis vaccines but by the change of immunization from 3 months to 2 years
5133744 an antivaccine movement developed in japan as a consequence of increasing numbers of adverse reactions to whole cell pertussis vaccines in the mid 1970s after two infants died within 24 h of the vaccination from 1974 to 1975 the japanese government temporarily suspended vaccinations subsequently the public and the government witnessed the re emergence of whooping cough with 41 deaths in 1979 this series of unfortunate events revealed to the public that the vaccine had in fact been beneficial furthermore researchers and the japanese government proceeded to develop safer pertussis vaccines japan now has the most experience worldwide with acellular pertussis vaccines being the first country to have approved their use this review describes the major events associated with the japanese vaccination program the japanese experience should be valuable to other countries that are considering the development and use of such vaccines
5133745 we have become so accustomed to double talk that we have trouble understanding something as empirical as science something that is more than smoke and mirrors
5133746 the banks are just holding their head above water and bhp is down a bit but its annual report is coming out today and thats expected to be pretty robust he said
5133747 we were going down the second fairway and my caddie mark long said lets say you are four behind

5133749 he got to 6 up after 15 and i just took my foot off the gas

5133752 we learned to understand that peace and dialogue respect are the most basic values
5133753 i see the hand of god working in this development process
5133754 the formation of this strategic alliance for the kingdom of god and its practical expression through cercapaz has meant a great personal satisfaction for me
5133755 a large ministry partner with missional minded leadership access throughout the country and many gifts
5133756 omar is a significant resource for cercapaz in developing this vision
5133757 without being aware of the extent of his teaching influence omar has helped give voice and structure to a missional identity and vision for ubach and has thus paved the way for our partnership to become one of church to church mc canada and ubach
5133758 the rector pulled out their statement of mission that identified their theology as anabaptist omar as well as the other seminary officials said this is clearly in contradiction with our own conference ubach
5133759 we ubach are looking for an identity we think we want to be anabaptist we want to be a peace church
5133760 one of the things that is interesting is that many people from outside the church look at this program with enthusiasm and are interested to be a part of it
5133761 just today i made a call to a friend who is a teacher and not associated with any church i asked if he would like to help out with this program and he replied of course that is the most wonderful program that i would like to participate in
5133762 it was a way of saying that this is what we have and that this miracle of love extends through us
5133763 we have to do a benefit concert for each and every local artist who either gets sick or passes away
5133764 i could sit here and talk all day about the blues artists who die and die broke
5133765 people come here from different parts of the country and the world to experience our culture
5133766 for some reason over the years this festival has changed from a cultural event to a concert
5133767 we should be embracing our artists and show the world what the mississippi delta and the city of greenville has to offer
5133768 blues is just a minute part of record sales today
5133769 the pirating issue is a major problem in modern music today
5133770 they live lives so far away from the realness that the blues represents
5133771 people across the country are crazy about our culture here

5133782 its going to take a little while for it to register i visualized every night that id be the first across the line and see everyone in my peripheral vision it was so fun being back there and watching it unfold this turned out just the way i wanted it to

5133796 but what we have found in the history of our country is that you cant trust the executive
5133797 we have to understand you can fight the war on terrorism and lose everything if you have no civil liberties left when you get through fighting the war
5133798 the executive has to fight and win the war at all costs but judges understand the war has to be fought but it cant be at all costs
5133799 we still have to preserve our civil liberties judges are the kinds of people you want to entrust that kind of judgment to more than the executive
5133800 i havent seen a proposal for a better way than presenting an application to the fisa court and having an independent judge decide if its really the kind of thing that we ought to be doing recognizing that how we view civil liberties is different in time of war
5133801 i have seen a proposal for a worse way and thats what the president did with the nsa program
5133802 i had approved five fisa coverages warrants on my cell phone
5133803 in a time of national emergency like that changes have to be made in procedures we changed a number of fisa procedures
5133804 based on the oral briefing by the director of the fbi to the chief judge of the fisa court
5133805 judges shouldnt give advisory opinions and i was never asked to give an opinion in court
5133806 were making sure theres not some political shenanigan going on or some improper motive for the surveillance
5133807 the fact that they have to submit it to us keeps them honest

5133809 i object to this because i think the listener has used a tenuous legal claim to bully a blogger into retracting some moderate and reasonable criticisms
5133810 the post is largely a model of fairness it sets out the background facts it raises questions rather than making allegations it even allows that the listeners editor may have made the change for other reasons
5133811 the apology looks to have been drafted by said lawyers
5133812 the correction and apology looks ham fisted to me it even includes a retraction of things that werent even in the post
5133813 the proper response would have been a one line letter politely telling the listener to sit on its thumb i doubt that any further action would have been taken but bloggers and those who host their blogs cant always be that brave thats what makes leaning on assertions of legal rights in situations like this reprehensible i think
5133814 if you really want to defend free speech which i doubt tell the people who demand to put agw
5133815 look everyone demesure is living in a dream world if he believes the world bank imf and all the governements of the world are involved in some sort of climate change conspiracy
5133816 emphasis on extreme scenarios may have been appropriate at one time
5133817 he took the above sentence out of context from a paragraph in which
5133818 george h taylor is the state climatologist for oregon a faculty member of oregon state universitys college of oceanic and atmospheric science
5133819 im not too sure about that since their lack of activity only emerges when it comes to actually mitigating climate change

5133844 once you create a bureaucracy it is near to impossible to ever get rid of it
5133845 its crucial to the public understanding of what happened it helps give the public a sense of place

5133862 we know at the moment in rat studies that our compound inhibited the development of fibrosis and the interesting thing in the future would be to see whether we can actually reverse fibrosis
5133863 currently we have some quite strong data showing that our compounds prevent fibrosis occurring
5133864 we have looked at it in a series of animal models that are very predictive of clinical outcomes hence the reason we are quite confident that our data is robust
5133865 a lot of the remodelling or the fibrosis that occurs in patients with heart attacks causes the heart to fail over the short term
5133866 if it was the first of its kind on the market it would be a huge step forward because there are currently no anti fibrotics on the market
5133867 it would be up there with some of the blockbuster drugs like the blood pressure lowering compounds it would be a huge advance in medical knowledge

5133872 the greenhouse mafia in australia are in canberra and in full flight
5133873 what theyre trying to do is protect australias coal exports whilst at the same time denying the potential to develop sophisticated exports in manufacturing renewable energy
5133874 i think they the government must be feeling under pressure on this issue because theres not one authority which really supports the retention of this target now that the decision has been made to introduce an emissions trading scheme
5133875 its an election promise but there must be other ways that that can be dealt with
5133876 the reality is that renewable energy technology programs also drive improvements in efficiency in generation so theyre driving the price down

5133883 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5133884 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5133885 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5133886 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5133887 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5133888 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5133889 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5133890 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5133891 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5133892 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5133893 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5133894 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5133895 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5133896 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5133897 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5133898 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

5133901 it starts with an odd feeling a shadow in the mirror a whisper only undine can hear its time to come home and it builds one hot day when undine imagines knitting together a few scattered clouds she creates a massive thunderstorm who is undine where does her power come from what is she meant to do undine needs answers to these questions so she sets off in search of a father shed always believed was dead and a self shes only beginning to discover but undines magic is powerful wild and dangerous and her feelings as she uncovers the truth are even fiercer will undine find herself or lose herself and everyone she loves
5133902 here in south la we have a plethora of liquor stores and fast food restaurants but whats frustrating is that the need is there for fresh produce and yet we havent been able to get our own domestic grocery chains into the area
5133903 it will be very interesting to see if people will gravitate towards it
5133904 when tesco first came to america we were pleasantly surprised they were saying they wanted to do things differently
5133905 but today almost a year later weve found theyre a lot like others in the industry opening stores in the exact same locations neglecting others
5133906 revitalisation with condos and lofts and a bunch of high end developments
5133907 they didnt show up in the heart of south central
5133908 we want them to engage in the community and talk to us
5133909 we have developed a very competitive pay and benefits package for all of our employees

5133923 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5133924 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5133925 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5133926 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5133927 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5133928 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5133929 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5133930 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5133931 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

5133953 mechanical engineers over the next two decades will be called upon to develop technologies that foster a cleaner healthier safer and sustainable global environment
5133954 this large and growing population will need access to food and clean water effective sanitation energy education healthcare and affordable transportation
5133955 this market is not populated by poor victims of circumstance but resilient and creative entrepreneurs and potential customers there is tremendous value in helping these people achieve a better quality of life at present most engineering schools do not address the needs of destitute people even though many of these people live in industrialized countries yet the needs of the underserved for engineering solutions are likely to increase as population grows teaching engineers how to develop locally appropriate engineering solutions for the underserved is a key to developing sustainably for example engineers without borders is fostering sustainable development and teaching engineers valuable skills for the future
5133956 by 2028 advances in computer aided design materials robotics nanotechnology and biotechnology will democratize the process of designing and creating new devices
5133957 creating a renaissance for engineering entrepreneurs the engineering workforce will change as more engineers work at home as part of larger decentralized engineering companies or as independent entrepreneurs
5133958 faster processing and network speeds will soon allow future engineers to design entire products as a system rather than separate pieces this will expand the capacities of engineers and enable more complex designs to be completed anywhere
5133959 within 20 years it is likely that home based personal fabricators will be economically attractive and available to anyone who wants them engineers will be able to act as independent operators interacting with colleagues around the world they can design at home with advanced cad systems or in collaboration with their global colleagues in virtual worlds they will be able to use home based fabrication technology to test many of their designs engineers of the future will have better tools to build careers as individual inventors independent entrepreneurs and employees in distributed businesses that draw on engineering talent from around the world
5133960 virtual worlds could soon become truly interactive environments for interacting with colleagues combined with advances in cad systems it will be possible for mechanical engineers to collaborate in immersive interactive environments where they can design collaboratively test hypothesis run models and simulations and observe their creations in three dimensions much as an engineer can observe a car being built with their colleagues on the shop floor
5133961 whenever society has needed great contribution from mechanical engineering in the past the profession has stepped up to the challenge all that will be different in 2028 is the increased scope of the challenges and the increased number of people who will be living in a cleaner healthier safer and sustainable world because mechanical engineers believed they should

5133963 what weve produced with the online component is not a marketing line in the budget its part of the delivery of scorched

5134010 hey char ontzettend jammer dat je het programma hebt moeten verlaten we hebben je wekenlang gevolgd en zijn ontzettend trots op je op dit moment zijn we naar de try out van romeo en julia waarin sjoerd en noa spelen we zijn er vanavond weer kus van ons allemaal
5134011 een beetje wel maar vooral vanwege noa die de hele morgen in haar kleedkamer heeft zitten drinken
5134012 ik zit ook in de zaal ik weet zeker dat het goed gaat vertrouw me ik heb zoveel repetities gezien en ze gingen allemaal goed vincent en ik zitten vooraan en we nemen het op voor charlene en alex we zijn allemaal hartstikke trots op je

5134017 what are your typical catering options on the road can you get more than carrot sticks celery and cheese
5134018 if were doing a proper tour well have our own caterers and they just make the most amazingly outrageous food for us like nut roasts or spinach and mushroom lasagna im a huge fan of pasta which is fortunate a good arrabbiata or linguine with pesto and a fresh salad is a brilliant meal to me
5134019 not only are you involved in speaking out against climate change but you also greened your own home in london
5134020 my flat is amazing we bought it off a bachelor and it had been given no love so we gutted and remodeled it using all sustainable wood nontoxic pain and tons of solar panels which means were hardly using any electricity from the grid
5134021 well my mum was always into environmental stuff both my parents actually have a great affinity for the outdoors they met as rock climbers and i grew up in a beautiful part of scotland on the coast in st andrews so environmental causes have always made a great deal of sense to me because you can see things changing
5134022 it is such a privilege to announce the upcoming expansions for two of our most popular games everquest and everquest ii in a venue like fan faire where we are joined by thousands of our loyal fans and it seems more than appropriate to give those fans access to both of the expansions for free

5134028 newer evidence describes how curcumin interacts with certain proteins to generate anti cancer activity inside the body were focusing on the pathways that are most involved in cancer and trying to optimize for those properties
5134029 most of the interaction between our compound and the overactive protein comes from what are called hot spots on the proteins surface
5134030 for each spot we can design small chemical fragments and link them together to make a molecule this is what computer aided design and modeling can do
5134031 very small changes that may seem insignificant can have dramatic effects on these toxicity properties
5134032 but most of the compounds weve made have been more potent than curcumin against the cancer cells
5134033 to be able to develop a drug that in the future could have potential to treat 50 percent of these cancers would be a major contribution
5134034 wolves consume many prey animals a minimum of 150 200 moose contribute to an isle royale wolfs diet over the course of its lifetime and the prey consume a whole lot of plants
5134035 just by being who they are wolves and other top predators increase the sample size because they do the sampling for us
5134036 since the widespread combustion of fossil fuels we have put a human fingerprint on atmospheric carbon dioxide
5134037 that fingerprint shows up in trees and it shows up in animals that eat trees but it shows up with the least variation in the top predators
5134038 its noisy for trees less noisy for moose and even less noisy for wolves
5134039 in a way this whole study can be summed up by asking how many trees does a wolf represent
5134040 instrumental measurements of environmental variables are only available for about the past few hundred years so this may help us understand paleo environmental change better and if we can understand ancient environments better then our ability to predict future changes is improved
5134041 stable isotopes ecological integration and environmental change wolves record atmospheric carbon isotope trend better than tree rings
5134042 this is the first time anyone has done really fundamental hands on quantum mechanics with an organic led
5134043 we can convert the spin information into a current and manipulate it and change it
5134044 we are manipulating this information and reading it out again we are writing it and reading it
5134045 even the smallest transistor today consists of hundreds of thousands of atoms
5134046 the ultimate goal of miniaturization is to implement electronics on the scale of atoms and electrons
5134047 just like a mass on a spring the pulse produces an oscillation of the spins of singlets and triplets in the organic led

5134049 dus zo met mij dansen en flirten mag wel maar neuken mogen we niet
5134050 aanvang sjoerd houd even je kaken op elkaar en stop met flirten
5134051 noa en sjoerd jullie vooral opgelet ik heb een belangrijke mededeling nouja claudia heeft er een
5134052 mijn vriend vincent heeft me op dit moment hard nodig zoals de meeste wel zullen weten heeft hij een geknapte aorta laatst gehad en is hier gelukkig van herstelt maar hij heeft totaal geen conditie meer en heeft de gehele dag begeleiding nodig omdat hij zelf bijna niets meer kan en voor hem offer ik me graag op ik houd van hem ik geef om hem daarom dus
5134053 ik vind het natuurlijk erg jammer maar zulke zaken gaan voor
5134054 noa zal de rol overnemen en shaila zal de rol van noa overnemen omdat shaila maar een beperkte rol had raakt die vervallen vanwege de eigenlijke nutteloze functie
5134055 misschien vind de regisseur het wel wat als we de bedscene helemaal naakt doen
5134056 sorry dat je nu met noa zit opgescheept ik had het liever ook anders gehoopt voor je
5134057 ok dan gaan we nu over tot de zoenscene die
5134058 ik bedoel de scene van het feest maar waar jij en julia elkaar voor het eerst zoenen
5134059 nu ga ik toch nog eens die lippen van jou raken met de mijne
5134060 ik vind het een beetje kansloos om om zoiets kleins de repetitie stil te zetten
5134061 en daarnaast vond ik het behoorlijk kinderachtig en onprofessioneel van je en ik wilde je niet voor lul zetten
5134062 en nu heb jij een keer je zin gehad dit is toch al wat je zo lang wilde
5134063 sjoerd mag tijdelijk bij jou komen wonen beau en ik hebben ontzettende ruzie en ik zie het niet zitten om vandaag en vanavond samen met hem samen in ons appartement te blijven
5134064 ja is goed als het goed is is vincent thuis maar kan even duren voor hij open doet omdat hij in een rolstoel zit
5134065 kun je trouwens wel dan voor vanavond koken het is mijn beurt maar de repetities hier voor romeo en julia lopen volgens mij flink uit de hand het gaat niet bepaald lekker
5134066 ok is goed dan ga ik zo eventjes boodschappen doen
5134067 ik vind het best jammer voor charlene dat ze nu genomineerd is omdat ze op de foto is gezien bij alex
5134068 nou weet je het is wel een beetje haar eigen schuld
5134069 van het toneel af er wordt weer begonnen claudia en sjoerd jullie staan links op het podium in afwachting van de priester die jullie zal komen ophalen voor het huwelijk noa de voedster weet van dit huwelijk af en wil dolgraag er bij zijn je staat nu nog even in de coulissen maar komt later op ken jij je tekst
5134070 every time ive compromised ive lost when i held firm i won the problem with too many environmentalists today is that they are trying to write the compromise instead of letting those we pay to compromise do it they think they get power by taking people to lunch or being taken to lunch when in reality they are only being taken
5134071 houd je er wel rekening mee dat we zo meteen naar die stagevoorlichting moeten
5134072 ik ga effe douchen en dan gaan we zo meteen wel effe naar die voorlichting
5134073 gaat hij zo naar school terwijl er twee meisjes in zijn bed liggen
5134074 weten jullie trouwens wat alex bedoelde tijdens zijn terugkeer op de boot in the cruise
5134075 hij is hier heel eventjes geweest toen hij samen met die andere gozer uh musido van het schip moest na de samensmelting
5134076 sorry ik mag niks zeggen ik heb de brief wel gelezen maar ik mag absoluut nog niets zeggen maak je maar geen zorgen over alex hij verdient die brief
5134077 het is dus de bedoeling dat jullie een half jaar mee gaan lopen bij een instantie waarin jullie later verzeild kunnen raken bijvoorbeeld een tv producent of een radiostation spelen in een musical jullie weten wel wat
5134078 meneer van zwieten zou u zo vriendelijk willen zijn om uzelf minder uitdagend te kleden
5134079 de twee bovenste knoopjes zijn los je ziet toch niks
5134080 ik vind dat je behoorlijk uitdagend gekleed bent tegenover mij
5134081 volgens mij zijn relaties tussen docenten en leerlingen niet toegestaan hoor
5134082 bij wijze van zou ik hier naakt kunnen gaan zitten en dan mag u nog niets met me doen dus
5134083 oja sorry ik moest met vincent naar het ziekenhuis geef maar een extra folder aan sjoerd mee die krijg ik dan straks wel
5134084 deze school heeft erg veel talent heb ik gemerkt gelukkig er sprongen echter een paar talenten uit en die hebben dan ook de hoofdrollen gekregen
5134085 ga eerst maar eens goed uitrusten want je ziet ontzettend bleek
5134086 ik ben ontzettend blij dat je me hebt vertelt dat je zon last had van je maag
5134087 omdat ze die klacht wisten zijn ze meteen daar gaan zoeken om de aorta te dichtten anders was je helemaal dood gebloed van binnen

5134090 a raunchy novel with a dauntless heroine has transformed the lives of a 93 year old author and three of her friends who were living in nursing homes pushed by her daughter in law who found the manuscript and couldnt put it down lorna page has become one of the oldest debut writers on record with equally unusual social results
5134091 jordans life sucks her ex boyfriend michael slept his way through half the student body and then killed himself but now somehow he appears at her window every night begging her to let him in jordan cant understand why he wants her but she feels her resistance wearing down after all her life once a broken record of boring parties meaningless hookups and friends she couldnt relate to now consists of her drinking alone in her room as she waits for the sun to go down michael needs to be invited in before he can enter all jordan has to do is say the words

5134106 you know that grated horseradish in the fridge would be the berries on this
5134107 so i pulled out the jar but noticed that the use by date thereon was september of 08
5134108 en acuerdo de esta fecha he resuelto que los oficiales d diego guzm n y d ram n picarte pasen al estado de chile con el importante fin de promover en l la insurrecci n contra el gobierno espa ol y que a usted de cuantas noticias crean interesantes

5134115 i got up and i could see the laundry room glowing with fire
5134116 but that was as an emt not a firefighter all i had to do was watch
5134117 i just want people to know how grateful we are to the community
5134118 i do think china will take the most gold medals
5134119 i cried because i felt extremely regretful and i let so many people down
5134120 i feel that i have let down the country by winning only a single bronze through four olympics
5134121 if the momentum carries on and we stick to a gap of this size at the end of yesterday i think the race for gold medals is settled
5134122 but the americans will top the overall medal tally eventually
5134123 given energy volatility margin pressures across the industry and in some cases liquidity concerns
5134124 confieso con mis labios que jes s es el se or creo en mi coraz n que dios le resucit de los muertos creo que tengo vida eterna paz y
5134125 woe is unto me if i preach not the gospel

5134127 i dont know how many times i had told kayla not to text when she was driving
5134128 there is no such notion any more in georgia as russian peacekeepers there can be no russian peacekeepers these are just russian forces
5134129 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5134130 russia overreached used disproportionate force against a small neighbour and is now paying the price
5134131 russias reputation as a potential partner in international institutions diplomatic political security economic is frankly in tatters
5134132 i have signed three decrees including one on the resignation of the government another on proclamation of a state of emergency in south ossetia and the third on setting up an emergency committee to settle the consequences of the georgian aggression
5134133 the russian troops are starting to pull out and russian peacekeepers are coming in
5134134 they write rockin songs with vocals that make your hairs stand on end beautiful lyrics best thing since the cramps passionate pure quirky grooving sultry uncompromising music gifted performers with an honest philosophy to their music and sound gorgeous melodies powerful and emotional
5134135 when you have an event that transcends popular culture the only place you can aggregate these audiences is network television
5134136 these elements cannot bear when the government is making progress
5134137 they are trying to create rifts among the sangha what they want is to cripple the countrys stability and achieve their petty political objectives students should identify these elements and evade them parents should find out what their children are doing in the university and no one should be allowed take them for a ride the opposition should not oppose for the sake of opposing they should get away from this habit of opposing everything what the government is doing
5134138 i am facing a great threat from terrorists and a terrorist in the guise of protesting students could wreak havoc police observed utmost restraint when the students were trying to enter temple trees when other available means failed we had to employ force to disperse the students trying to enter temple trees all students violently tried to enter temple trees even after five of their representatives were informed that they could have discussions with me they tried to enter temple trees putting my security at stake
5134139 its not just a shortcoming on the part of the public works department but the city as a whole is failing
5134140 having 10 5 million dollars sitting out there is something we desperately need to collect on
5134141 unless we do something to make people realize that their decision to ignore tickets has consequences well never collect that revenue
5134142 i would have thought id get a letter or something
5134143 and the next thing you know i was blocked in
5134144 we have people who come in and we know who they are
5134145 we do what we are capable of under the citys enforcement rules
5134146 a lot of cities with more stringent regulations have higher collection rates
5134147 with a decreased city staff it is a prudent business decision to hire an outside agency to collect our outstanding debt
5134148 i think its important in what it means to the city
5134149 youre not but ppl who dont know you may think you are
5134150 i must have been really stupid really dumb what did i do how did i get myself into this
5134151 god turn off my emotions cuz its not helping me its just complicating my life
5134152 i cud ask yuh to talk to god for meh i just fed up and i goin to end it
5134153 and do good for with such sacrifices god is pleased
5134154 what he does with it is between him and god my responsibility is to give

5134156 mom i almost went under and died but then i realized i could reach with my tippy toes
5134157 to stifle our republic by force and bring the catastrophe of a nuclear war
5134158 we will all have to go under 48 seconds his best is 48 05secs or the americans will kill us
5134159 this realistically is my final chance at an olympic medal and i want to use that as the burning motivation for the race
5134160 i hope we do some damage kick some russian butt i hope it fires them up because we are pretty fired up over
5134161 it made me angry and im happy for that feeling because i hadnt felt it enough since my last world record
5134162 i give them information and let them know counseling is available
5134163 she takes calls two nights a week from 5 p m to 5 a m which is great because we dont have that many people who take that many shifts a month
5134164 connie is a beacon of light to victims survivors of sexual violence
5134165 she is willing to get up at 4 a m and spend six hours at the hospital just for someone to know that another person cares about them
5134166 when i couldnt pick up my end of the stretcher
5134167 she has the ability to explain the forensic exam and to kind of prepare the victim prior to the examining nurse arriving
5134168 i was really impressed with her passion for survivors of sexual violence
5134169 very compassionate and loving but is still good with boundaries
5134170 in emergency medicine youre used to getting up in the middle of the night and going
5134171 its kind of like being back in the medical field
5134172 you have to walk away from it and not let it get to you
5134173 if you get your heart into it you get too emotionally involved
5134174 this season is a little bit out of the ordinary and really the most diversified that weve ever had before
5134175 were very committed to bringing all types of shows to a number of audiences
5134176 we had so many children who auditioned and didnt get into our shows that we wanted to offer more to them
5134177 the audience loves it because the comedy is so insane and zany all at the same time
5134178 its so much fun because you never know what youre going to come out with every night
5134179 who doesnt get a kick out of nuns doing fun silly things on stage i do
5134180 were very excited to be home and to provide more opportunities to young people in the area who want to perform
5134181 the success of jekyll and hyde this past april informed us that abt audiences enjoy and very much appreciate good musical drama and you cant get any more dramatic than miss saigon
5134182 season 4 definitely provides opportunities for abt to expand technically with lighting sound costuming and scenic design
5134183 elaborate dickensian costuming two story sets use of our trapped stage floor and fly loft advanced lighting techniques and yes helicopters are just a few of the elements around the corner
5134184 isnt it his job to promote faith and keep off sins
5134185 then whats the point of gods doings if everyone is so faithfull and abiding by the 10 commendments
5134186 wouldnt he shoot himself by such boredom or stay crisp cut and stroll his says
5134187 why is that we have to follow such rules of supposed enlightenment
5134188 arent we all self knowing enough to follow thy own acts of person
5134189 who is that we have to follow to be so god forsakenly blinded to which we are shou stood upon on
5134190 we who is you amp me or the world for the matter be so coincided by those words that have triggered the human psyche into much parrelle and abolishment
5134191 oh he who upons to open those gates of fury would be sooo entwined to be sooo condemned to a forsaken faith
5134192 is there no such dependency into not caring on what we should say and or act
5134193 so is there no soul left to not follow these words of foulment even the term indie has lost its meaning of selfness
5134194 poverty and backwardness are my enemies i will fight against them

5134210 inflation costs have not been addressed by the state funding formulas for three years
5134211 unless the state adjusts the formula well be looking at cutting something
5134212 i believe the finance system needs to be reformed so there is not only an index for inflation which includes gas utilities and insurance costs which are going up for all school districts as well as an ability for the school districts to keep more of their money
5134213 this election is important to the people of permatang pauh and to the nation at large it has a bearing on national politics
5134214 these are dirty tactics and a malicious campaign on their part and completely immoral
5134215 we will work hard to maintain our level of support and improve it
5134216 we are the underdog its going to be an uphill task but nothing is impossible
5134217 we dont believe in the sodomy charge there is no evidence its the same old story to smear anwar

5134224 in fact it matched our qualifying run in the good conditions on friday night so if were going to see race conditions with some heat in the track like we saw today i think were pretty ready and we have the champ first round
5134225 we are trying to sneak some stuff in here to test we wanted to make sure we got in the show so we left our normal setup in the napa dodge charger on friday on saturday we put in our experimental stuff the first run saturday 7 695 84 52 was i think a little bit of driver error were not sure why the car made a hard right hand turn when it left the starting line but whatever we did with the chassis we fixed it it went right down the middle in the last pass and it was a great run
5134226 we hope that mr gambari would be able to revive the stalled dialogue
5134227 its very disappointing about the showdown but it was in our own hands
5134228 we started the year in the lead our problem has been that were a top five car when the suns out but we havent been a top 10 car in the night sessions and it bit us this weekend
5134229 we can win if we qualify because the race is run during day time but nhra gives us that hero shot friday night and were still trying to figure out what the car wants
5134230 the good news is that in the war were qualified again we have a good chance to put some more points on the board tomorrow and stay in that top 10
5134231 i sure would like to close out the first part of the countdown to the championship season with a win though

5134235 he was choking the s t out of me and i wasnt fixing to die that night
5134236 i didnt have my music on and my windows were rolled up
5134237 plus it was cold and i had my leather jacket on
5134238 they slammed me down on the ground put pistols and tasers to my back
5134239 i didnt know what they were here for they said it was for assaulting a peace officer
5134240 whenever he told me to watch my mouth i looked at him like he was crazy like he didnt look like an actual police officer to me
5134241 decker was calling me a chicken s mother f get out and i will beat your ass
5134242 there was nothing we could do but make the best of it
5134243 i dont ever want to deal with a storm like that again believe me it will change your attitude for the worse
5134244 the reasoning was that those who were offended could turn away
5134245 but that doesnt prevent the state from criminalizing a verbal assault of repeated loud profanities in a public place that disrupts the rights of others
5134246 but you dont have the right to continue to assault people with offensive speech once theyve indicated they dont want to hear it
5134247 you better come home rested take that any way you like

5134262 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5134263 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5134264 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5134265 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5134266 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5134267 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5134268 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5134271 in this weeks burn notice michael has to assist an agent called victor with a job while also helping a family friend who has a problem the second season of the show has managed to juggle two storylines per episode with great ease but this is the first episode where one of the stories suffers as a consequence ricky is being set up for embezzlement by one eddie currently it looks like ricky has stolen around two million dollars from an account owned by the hip hop mogul valentine played by method man and valentine has noticed the loss method mans performance in this is superb hes clearly learnt a lot from his time as cheese wagstaff on the wire and its a shame hes put into such a short story it would be wise of the writers to bring him back the conference room scene where he repremands his people and the scene where he banters briefly with sam bruce are the two best scenes in the episode it would be great too see valentine back on screen in a later episode in contrast the new agent victor was less palatable hes clearly set up as a loose cannon and is irritating both for michael and the viewer hes clearly more hands on than carla but also more reckless the storyline involving him interfaces nicely with the ricky one especially when he directly interferes just to show michael whos boss but the scenes are not as strong as the ones from the other storyline ultimately its hard to see why hes been introduced instead of carla and it seems likely that hes going to end up in a body bag soonish overall its a pretty solid episode that has its good moments but feels like there is too much crammed in while michael is clearly overloaded with demands from clients and the agents at the same time the viewer also feels somewhat overloaded as the episode runs at such a scorching pace it never lets up this does mean it never has a dull moment but it also means that neither story gets the full treatment it deserves its a great episode but there have been better so far this season
5134272 god puts me through hell so i could make it to heaven
5134273 you are my best friend i hope i see you again

5134280 in the next few months growers will be informed of their water allocation for the 2008 2009 growing season
5134281 with water supply at critical levels there is every indication that this allocation will not increase from last year and in some cases it may be less
5134282 research shows that it is possible to grow profitable crops on reduced water supplies but management systems must change
5134283 growers need to know more about the exact water they need how to access additional irrigation water and understand more about the allocation decision making process
5134284 they also need to know about how to maintain the long term health of their vineyard
5134285 having more knowledge about the market empowers growers to make more strategic decisions

5134324 the weather was good it was a good turn out
5134325 were going to finish somewhere between 850 000 and 870 000 i would say thats a great fair and that will probably rank up there as one of the second or third best fairs ever
5134326 its been about as ideal as you can get it especially for this time of the year we have had similar runs in previous years especially back in 2004 but it doesnt get much better than this and that certainly helps bring the crowds out
5134327 busy all day and just a great day for us

5134331 basically shes got american pennies shoved in the hinges it makes it impossible to open the door from the inside and effectively locks someone in a room because the pennies keep the hinges from swinging properly
5134332 why dont you quit whining about it and figure out a way to get us out

5134346 she no doubt hopes itll put us in the mood or something stupid like that
5134347 because shes an evil little imp that thrives on chaos
5134348 dont even think its because i want something like this to happen you hear me i cant think of a more repulsive man to be locked in here with hell youre not even much of a man are you

5134359 but well need more quality in the future if we want to win the premier league or champions league well need more than this
5134360 lampard is not brazilian hes english but he touched the ball very well it was his style the same with ballack we have a style its impossible to say to deco foul people thats not his style
5134361 i only give the players the freedom to play and allow them to express their style this is a chelsea performance not a scolari performance
5134362 im happy with anelka i said to him you will have three or four chances you need to make one or two goals for me and for the people i want people to believe in you more than before
5134363 theyll go away for a few days now to the national team thats frustrating but this is a fifa date
5134364 well have six or seven players at training and start building some ideas for the game against wigan well hope the others get back in condition and well be ready
5134365 youre not going to break into the top four no one is this year spurs have got a squad and cant even win at middlesbrough so you start forgetting about them the top four are on another level
5134366 when they play pass and move its very difficult to stay with them

5134370 oil prices also fell to the lower end of the recent trading range on friday so some traders in the market probably saw that as a buying opportunity

5134373 you fucked me in the phone booth you know you took me by surprise

5134377 4 saya kira yang menjadi masaalah ialah sikap tak mahu belajar sains yang membelenggu muslim sekarang ini besar kemungkinan kerana yang mengajar ilmu agama terlalu sedikit yang minat dengan sains yang mahu mengaikan pelbagai teori sains kepada ketuhanan saya melihat pewaris pewaris yang sebegini tidak berjalan dengan dua kaki iaitu maaf kata tempang
5134378 4 dengan hanya menambahkan niat atau tujuan yang betul melaksanakan setiap satu kerja allah menjadikan kerja tersebut sebagai satu kategori yang berbeza yang lebih tinggi dari kerja biasa kepada ibadah dari hanya mendapat keizinan kepada mendapat keredhaan allah swt begitu mudahnya tugas manusia mendapatkan keredhaan dari tuhannya menjadi sesuatu yang amat berat untuk dilaksanakan kerana ramai antara manusia yang tidak mahu memikirkannya sebelum membuat sesuatu pekerjaan
5134379 ilmu tauhid adalah ilmu mengenal allah dengan memahami ilmu sains kefahaman kita kepada allah akan menjadi lebih berkesan sebagaimana contoh orang purba pun pandai buat rumah tetapi dengan sains dan teknologi teknik membuat rumah menjadi lebih berkesan dan menghasilkan rumah yang jauh lebih baik kalau pemikiran kita terbuka kepada manhaj ilmu sains akal rational insyaallah kewujudan allah akan menjadi lebih bermakna pada kita sebagai muslim dan mukmin

5134392 i make this look good you wasnt rockin it right
5134393 i know you think you fly on point like rev and bringing back 88 when you was born in 87
5134394 all they asked was that we should remember the poor the very thing i was eager to do
5134395 we are hoping to get into patients within the next 12 months or so
5134396 we know at the moment in rat studies that our compound inhibited the development of fibrosis and the interesting thing in the future would be to see whether we can actually reverse fibrosis
5134397 currently we have some quite strong data showing that our compounds prevent fibrosis occurring
5134398 we have looked at it in a series of animal models that are very predictive of clinical outcomes hence the reason we are quite confident that our data is robust
5134399 a lot of the remodelling or the fibrosis that occurs in patients with heart attacks causes the heart to fail over the short term
5134400 if it was the first of its kind on the market it would be a huge step forward because there are currently no anti fibrotics on the market
5134401 yeah i think about divorcing him her husband all the time but why should i settle for part of the paycheck when i can get the whole thing
5134402 i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me
5134403 salvation is found in no one else for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved
5134404 but the new rebel is a skeptic and will not entirely trust anything he has no loyalty therefore he can never be really a revolutionist and the fact that he doubts everything really gets in his way when he wants to denounce anything for all denunciation implies a moral doctrine of some kind and the modern revolutionist doubts not only the institution he denounces but the doctrine by which he denounces it thus he writes one book complaining that imperial oppression insults the purity of women and then he writes another book in which he insults it himself he curses the sultan because christian girls lose their virginity and then curses mrs grundy because they keep it as a politician he will cry out that war is a waste of life and then as a philosopher that all life is waste of time a russian pessimist will denounce a policeman for killing a peasant and then prove by the highest philosophical principles that the peasant ought to have killed himself a man denounces marriage as a lie and then denounces aristocratic profligates for treating it as a lie he calls a flag a bauble and then blames the oppressors of poland or ireland because they take away that bauble the man of this school goes first to a political meeting where he complains that savages are treated as if they were beasts then he takes his hat and umbrella and goes on to a scientific meeting where he proves that they practically are beasts in short the modern revolutionist being an infinite skeptic is always engaged in undermining his own mines in his book on politics he attacks men for trampling on morality in his book on ethics he attacks morality for trampling on men therefore the modern man in revolt has become practically useless for all purposes of revolt by rebelling against everything he has lost his right to rebel against anything
5134405 remember that at that time you were separate from christ excluded from citizenship in israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise without hope and without god in the world
5134406 for since the creation of the world gods invisible qualities his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen being understood from what has been made so that men are without excuse
5134407 now we know that whatever the law says it says to those who are under the law so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to god therefore no one will be declared righteous in his sight by observing the law rather through the law we become conscious of sin
5134408 humans are guilty because of our sin and god is the judge who has to deal with our sin because he is holy and any act of sin goes against his core nature he has to deal with it enter jesus who dies on the cross in our place jesus gets what we deserve we get what jesus deserved
5134409 the lord is not willing that any should perish but that all should reach repentance
5134410 he desires all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth
5134411 do i take any pleasure in the death of the wicked
5134412 for i take no pleasure in the death of anyone declares the sovereign lord repent and live
5134413 say to them as surely as i live declares the sovereign lord i take no pleasure in the death of the wicked but rather that they turn from their ways and live
5134414 hearing that jesus had silenced the sadducees the pharisees got together
5134415 to those who by patience in well doing seek for glory and honor and immortality he will give eternal life
5134416 when everything gets answered its fake so with that i think were done

5134436 the addition of this dramatically designed sport wagon is well synchronised with todays changing consumer tastes as a compelling alternative to suvs or other larger vehicles
5134437 this is an important step in cadillacs ongoing global expansion and of course in international markets like europe wagons have been and continue to be very significant the cts sport wagon is an important expansion to the cadillac line up worldwide
5134438 its a taut design that not only suggests sleekness but delivers it
5134439 indeed the drama of the saloon is amplified in the cts sport wagon as the centreline cue that is part of the exterior and interior is more prominent and plays a stronger role in defining the design at the rear of the vehicle

5134449 in the next few months growers will be informed of their water allocation for the 2008 2009 growing season ms hellams said
5134450 with water supply at critical levels there is every indication that this allocation will not increase from last year and in some cases it may be less
5134451 research shows that it is possible to grow profitable crops on reduced water supplies but management systems must change she said
5134452 growers need to know more about the exact water they need how to access additional irrigation water and understand more about the allocation decision making process
5134453 they also need to know about how to maintain the long term health of their vineyard
5134454 having more knowledge about the market empowers growers to make more strategic decisions ms hellams said

5134459 i think theyre cba taking a real serious look at it
5134460 we expect a strong first half of fiscal 2009 having already had a good start to fiscal 2009 mainly driven by continued strong global steel demand and prices bluescope managing director and chief executive paul omalley said
5134461 our asian businesses particularly thailand where economic conditions continue to improve are producing consistent results
5134462 our north american coated and building products businesses are performing at the solid levels at which they finished fiscal 2008 despite the uncertainty that currently exists within the us economy

5134469 carlos tevez will be back for the portsmouth match next week and wayne will be much sharper and much fitter and in the second half it started to show for him but unfortunately campbell also picked up an injury and i had to take him off so we were asking wayne to play through the middle when hes really needing games and it was a big ask
5134470 im not discussing anyone i think we have a good squad the same squad as last year and when tevez comes back and wayne gets games that will be my strike force thats what it was last season and im happy to continue with that there are 37 games left so it is not a disaster we have shown before we can come from behind
5134471 in spite of what everyone thinks were working really hard to bring quality players in
5134472 i think too often in the last few years newcastle have bought players that havent been quite good enough for whatever reason
5134473 sometimes they havent settled sometimes they havent seemed to understand what it means to play for newcastle united the three that weve got so far do and the next three must as well and if that means waiting then so be it
5134474 no team that has got to this stage of the competition should be regarded as a minnow

5134513 ive got to become a better quarterback i feel like every practice every year ive become more comfortable and i think this year i will be better than i was last year
5134514 and thought it might be brandon jacobs or somebody sometimes you start to throw before you realize who someone is and i saw it was chris snee that wouldnt have been a good idea
5134515 god puts me through hell so i could make it to heaven
5134516 he asked me before deployment you know my wife doesnt speak english doesnt understand the military
5134517 he pretty much asked me to watch over his family while he was gone so i did that until the day he died
5134518 it doesnt matter i want to make sure that his wife and child are okay
5134519 i would say the moon landing was right up there with the mets in the world series
5134520 but the deal is that i have to bring it back
5134521 i am playing with a lot of confidence but i will be happy if i get to the quarter final or to the second week
5134522 i know that when people see me they will think i have won 19 matches in a row and that no one has beaten me but i have not played rafael nadal roger federer or novak djokovic
5134523 i dont know what will happen if i play them
5134524 one of the big positives is going to be the oil price thats going to be the major point of differentiation between bhp and rio tinto as far as the market is concerned fat prophets analyst gavin wendt said last night
5134525 we saw spot oil prices hit a record high of us147 per barrel and that has to have a positive rub off on their earnings
5134526 sometime after the fire was put out and other emergency workers were called in thats when we secured the site
5134527 we have taken some complaints regarding that and they are being investigated
5134528 their employees were not cleaning the contents of the apartment units but were focused on the structural work and hallway walls
5134529 when the franchise employees had to enter into a residential unit to clean the walls they were almost always escorted by a police officer facility manager or security representative
5134530 our franchise owner has not been contacted by the apartment facilities manager or the police department
5134531 hes probably become a genuine midfielder now playing on some of the best in the competition
5134532 hey tony guess whos got the best record in baseball
5134533 oh yeah cody jonathan well who has the world series trophy now
5134534 expecting people to be impressed by your ability to speak rudimentary spanish is pathetic
5134535 if we dont start winning i will see to it that my starting outfield is flayed alive on old timers day
5134536 the upcoming beijing olympic competition may be our last unless we are successful in adding the sport back to the olympic program for the 2016 games
5134537 we must demonstrate to the international olympic committee not only does our game belong alongside the other great sports of the world but our sport is manageable from a television and operational standpoint
5134538 one of the unique aspects of our game is that it has no time limit yay though i know its surprising lots of other team sports dont have time limits in fact theoretically even a tennis match could go on indefinitely i think in order to make the last wimbledon more manageable from a television and operational standpoint federer and nadal shouldve ended it by playing a game of beer pong at the net oh wait that could go on forever too crap the only solution extra inning contests can bring about the most exciting results for players and fans now yer talkin but such circumstances also make it difficult in the context of the olympic program only because nobody cares about baseball delays cause scheduling and logistical nightmares planned security transportation drug testing broadcasts and entertainment are just a few of the activities that may be seriously affected
5134539 planned security transportation drug testing broadcasts and entertainment are just a few of the activities that may be seriously affected

5134550 i worked for them for a year and a half and then this trying to support our family
5134551 were doing what we have to do now its been a long time coming but its here
5134552 i believe that people coming in now should get paid the same pay everyone else is getting
5134553 were trying to show them that were in it to win it right now and that we need something better than what theyre trying to provide
5134554 people are ready to get back to work theyre tired of sitting at home and finding ways to keep yourself busy
5134555 more stress to the point that probably ill end up crossing the line
5134556 as long as we stay together stick together and show them we are united i think it will come out for the better for us
5134557 people are doing what they need to do to stay strong we feel good about it

5134564 i know our call for arroyo to resign is futile but at least we have manifested our sentiments that she has already lost our trust and confidence considering that there is again a new conflict here in mindanao
5134565 i dont know if she has been informed properly that the recent fighting here has caused a lot of damage and the civilians especially the women and children are becoming sacrificial lambs
5134566 we are praying for peace to reign in our region we have suffered enough and it is about time to give peace a chance

5134570 the biggest thing is getting comfortable with the quarterback that plays a huge part in your development as a receiver especially in training camp
5134571 even if i make a good play or run a good route i still have to ask the quarterback questions about the way he wants it done ultimately hes going to throw the ball to the guy he feels most comfortable with
5134572 with us being so young a lot of people are questioning us we cant worry about that
5134573 you know why youre here the only thing we can worry about is coming out here and working hard and doing every little possible thing to help this team win
5134574 the main thing is reading the coverages and understanding what youre doing in the offense
5134575 every receiver from top to bottom has made great strides
5134576 when i was in that juncture of my career i didnt think i was going to do much more than be a backup to superman
5134577 he goes down and i had an opportunity to excel
5134578 these guys are in a similar position weve got a group of young hungry guys who want to prove themselves and earn a check for years to come theyve got a lot at stake so i know theyre going to give it all theyve got

5134583 were professional racers and not qualifying for a race is probably one of the most horrible feelings in the world for anyone on a race team
5134584 everybody on the rockstar energy drink team works hard and theyre giving 110 percent and working to the best of their abilities i was never so ready to go as i was on that last qualifying run i just knew the car was going to go down the race track but it didnt
5134585 we knew we had to qualify at this race even if it was no
5134586 its not because theres nobody over here who is talented we have a lot of talented guys on this rockstar energy drink team but im very upset about this and i apologize to rockstar and all of my fans well just have to regroup and head to indy
5134587 our crew chief todd okuhara is still recuperating from his inner ear infection and our clutch guy michaeal knudsen is still in the hospital after suffering burns in that freak accident here at maple grove on thursday everyone on the don schumacher racing team wishes him a quick recovery
5134588 phil shuler regular crew chief on the rockstar energy drink dodge did as good a job as he could tuning both cars with the help of alan johnson from the army team but the challenge was just too much and we didnt get it done
5134589 our chances obviously of making it into the top 10 for the countdown to 1 playoffs are over well just finish off the year by causing havoc for everyone else in the playoffs
5134590 to be honest everything was going really good up until i travelled over here and i ended up getting a really bad flu
5134591 i thought i was over it but obviously it took a lot more energy out of me than i thought

5134607 our goal is to always provide the global community with a nice balance of hip hop that caters to people who support all elements of our culture
5134608 this year we will be honoring the legacy of wayne frosty freeze frost who recently passed away on april 3 2008 frosty freeze was one of the last b boys who embodied the very dna of the original style character and moves that existed when this dance began in the early 70s
5134609 for some reason hip hop has that natural ability to bring people together and bridge the gaps that divide us because of our common interest
5134610 when people come to the rsc anniversary it becomes more than the anniversary its a pilgrimage to the mecca of hip hop its a way to get in touch with why they got in to hip hop and to meet some of the people that help to pioneer this culture and what better time and place to do it than nyc in the summer time
5134611 with out making it our agenda we carry ourselves in a manner that is respectful to all cultural backgrounds and genders
5134612 our goal as rock steady crew is to help promote hip hop in the best way that we can hip hop is a natural aphrodisiac for social bonding we all should all see it for what it is and embrace all the positive elements that it brings to us and spread that hip hop love
5134613 you dont know what it feels like to go fill out a job application where it says what do you do what do i write i spin on my head

5134620 prisons and jails are now holding centers and detox centers for persons who abuse substances and are mentally ill
5134621 about 40 percent of the inmates at the travis county jail had been involved with mhmr
5134622 that means you have someone who is looking at individuals who is educated about mental illness who is looking at them differently than other persons
5134623 were spending 43 435 000 per year on the travis county jail
5134624 youve just spent 50 million that were not spending on schools and hospitals and roads and bridges and parks and anything else
5134625 the folks back home see a washington bureau as a luxury
5134626 they get plenty of copy from the wires to fill up their pages i dont know that theres a real understanding of washington
5134627 ive watched people parachute into washington and they just dont have the same facility
5134628 get embedded in washington just as reporters develop sources at city hall or the school board you go beyond stenography into enterprise
5134629 the coverage obviously suffered after 04 we never went to the white house anymore
5134630 i was crushed i will never look at someone who has lost his job the same way
5134631 if you can get around the jargon we all talk in and make clear why this matters it will be read

5134648 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5134649 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5134650 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5134651 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5134652 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5134674 how many funds should you have four to six should do
5134675 as a general rule of thumb the more complexity that exists in a wall street cration the faster and farther investors should run

5134693 defendants had a duty to preserve documents well before this lawsuit was filed on october 1 2003
5134694 the lack of a written document retention and litigation hold policy and procedures for its implementation including timely reminders or even a single e mail notice to relevant employees exemplifies defendants lackadaisical attitude with respect to discovery of these important documents
5134695 d efendants failed to adequately search for and produce the relevant documents that the court ordered it to produce
5134696 a lthough it appears that defendants did not destroy any reports the fact that they represented to the court that no reports existed because defendants did not create them only two weeks before producing multiple reports constitutes serious misconduct that is grounds for sanctions
5134697 the court is left with the impression that defendants are not exactly sure how to interpret their own source code system and that the true dates have not been discovered
5134698 if plaintiffs prove that defendants infringed any claim of the 025 patent after pour over by the operation of the www realtor com www homebuilder com www homestore com www factorybuilthousing com or www remodel com websites the jury shall infer that the same websites infringed the 025 patent from the date it was launched
5134699 yeah that was pretty much the biggest mistake i ever made
5134700 what is the meaning of life how did the world begin do i have a soul will my soul survive my death what really exists could nothing have ever existed
5134701 we dont want to merely have a popular festival that shows redemptive films we want to help in the process of redeeming our brothers and sisters who for one reason or the other have fallen victims to slavery
5134702 as i watch the olympics i am reminded of what we can achieve if we all set aside our differences and work together our brothers and sisters who are victims of modern day slavery need our help and through the use of film and the support of others we believe we can make a tangible contribution to change the world
5134703 describes a range of conditions involving the liver that affects people who drink little or no alcohol
5134704 weve had some strong runs here in the past and we were hoping for a good finish here today we just were not able to find any front grip with the car and if you dont get the setup right with this car here at michigan you can be in for a long day
5134705 they guys never gave up and we tired a bunch of different stuff but the car just never seemed to respond like we thought it would well put this one behind us and look for a strong effort next weekend at bristol
5134706 i know the guys on this no 1 bass pro team are trying their hardest
5134707 i appreciate their effort and well just keep digging and see what happens
5134708 traffic affects every single person who comes to michigan international speedway so i cant emphasize how important a successful traffic plan is
5134709 it is a priority to get all our race fans in and out of the speedway quickly safely and effortlessly because the experience here is doorstep to doorstep
5134710 it was a decent run for this interstate batteries toyota
5134711 i felt like it was way better and far better than what it was here in the spring we ran up front all day long and that was nice to see we made gains and got a lot better from what we had at the start of the race but we just didnt have enough for the 99 carl edwards there at the end
5134712 we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys today
5134713 it just came down to when he beat us off pit road that was it for us we were good there on one set of tires and then that was pretty much all we had steve addington made great calls all day long and the guys gave me a great car to be able to come home second we werent that competitive here in the spring so im glad to come out of here with something to build on
5134714 we have had good cars down here five flags speedway all season
5134715 i had a run on the 82 enfinger and he gave me the lane because his car was tight i about had him cleared when the 94 cobb drilled me from behind
5134716 i think the 94 had the fastest car and he still could have won the race but hes young and impatient
5134717 eddie mercer had the line on me going into one i gave him plenty of room
5134718 as quick as mercer went around i think cobb just ran into him it hurt our car pretty good it was probably the most dominant car i have had since i have been racing here in pensacola
5134719 perfect it was hands down the best car i have had this season
5134720 it looked to me that mercer got under enfinger and just lost it he never took tires and he was loose it was bound to happen its frustrating because we were so good in the early part of the race
5134721 they were racing pretty hard there and guys were kind of getting pushy and they just all got together i was committed to the low lane and i got tagged a little bit from behind but they all spun up the track and i drove by
5134722 i guess the track officials didnt see the oil in turn one i know that i didnt see it
5134723 i thought our night was over but my crew did an amazing job to get the toe back in line on the car we came back and we picked up points but it was frustrating because i got by mercer and we were looking good it was just not our night
5134724 we were a little off tonight and i was trying to come home with a decent finish
5134725 i dont know what happened i just figured that it was going to happen you had mercer and enfinger up front and thats enough to make it interesting people get brain dead when there are 10 laps to go we have all done it we had a good points night by riding around at the end it all comes down to the last race
5134726 what the desperate will do to see the democratic convention
5134727 like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of
5134728 all i can do is be me whoever that is
5134729 can we tell the difference between junk food and fast food
5134730 we were very fast on defense looked like we were confident and knew what we were doing on offense we did not move the same way
5134731 you son of a bitch youre in love with her arent you
5134732 while we are interested in bringing in tourists i want to see the same faces in here
5134733 its really important to hear what they have to say its our last connection
5134734 she was at the very end of the slave times
5134735 somewhere here theres an opportunity for somebody to make some money
5134736 eroding your long term margins and your long term sales
5134737 we are very excited to introduce adjix to the newspaper publishing community this product offers an innovative and unique way to increase revenue and improve results for both the company and its customers
5134738 this service will not only make the linking process more user friendly but also provide a great opportunity to expand business for newspapers bloggers and email marketers alike
5134739 if youre coming to work for my company by god youre going to be a christian
5134740 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5134741 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5134742 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5134743 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5134744 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5134745 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5134746 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5134747 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5134748 who are open to doing something on the production side
5134749 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5134750 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5134751 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5134752 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5134753 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5134754 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5134755 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5134756 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5134757 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5134758 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5134759 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5134760 the phase i of the project was completed in less than 7 months including all the approvals
5134761 and we could not have been successful without the family and friends who have local presence
5134762 we want to bring some level of research orientation among faculty and students at nuva
5134763 i think the time is perfect for technocrats and particularly bits alumni to enter the field
5134764 not as employees but as founders and management who are the real decision makers and we can involve our friends and well wishers in these projects
5134765 somebody had to make the first move and start the first private engineering college where founders were bitsians
5134766 just imagine the collective impact of say 6 bits pilani campuses and 10 alumni founded colleges after 5 years without doubt this will help make bits pilani as probably the biggest brand for engineering education in india
5134767 we are working on a common structure guidelines and use of a common name which will also help strengthen bits pilani brand obviously these colleges will not use bits name and will be at locations where bits pilani does not plan to open a campus these colleges will take complementary role to bits pilani in all aspects and potential areas for collaboration and cooperation will be soon explored
5134768 and nuva is special because it is the first such college the team is gearing up for conquering next coimbatore and dehradun
5134769 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5134770 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5134771 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5134772 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5134773 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5134774 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5134775 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5134776 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5134777 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5134778 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5134779 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5134780 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5134781 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5134782 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5134783 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5134784 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5134785 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5134786 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5134787 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5134788 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5134789 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5134790 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5134791 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5134792 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5134793 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5134794 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5134795 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5134796 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5134797 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5134798 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5134799 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5134800 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5134801 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

5134808 es un maldito mp3 pero ni se libro del cacheo ni de que le tomaran las huellas y de que lo metieran en un calabozo pero almenos no le dispararon
5134809 i never really race for a medal i usually just race for my personal best this sport can be grinding the competition the expectations can chew you up all the joy that got you into the pool in the beginning can be replaced by a sense of dread a gnawing doubt about where all of this is taking you

5134818 i cant believe the american people cant see through this we already have a law the defense of marriage act weve all voted not where ive voted and others have said look marriage is between a man and a woman and states must respect that nobodys violated that law theres been no challenge to that law why do we need a constitutional amendment
5134819 if biden a washington insider to the nth degree why not clinton
5134820 how bout it buddy shall we make a run for it
5134821 m i n d institute lecture series on neurodevelopmental disorders
5134822 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5134823 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5134824 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5134825 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5134826 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5134827 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5134828 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5134829 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5134830 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5134831 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5134832 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5134833 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5134834 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5134835 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5134836 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5134837 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5134838 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5134839 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5134840 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

5134850 i wondered what i was going to say at this monumental time
5134851 the word that comes to mind epic what you did was epic
5134852 you dont go to the olympics just to say i am going to go especially because of who i am i am going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is
5134853 they voted me one of the top five olympians of all time some are dead but they invited the other ones to go to the olympics but not me yes i am a bit upset about it
5134854 we are so proud of you here michael in america and the way youve handled yourself
5134855 you know you werent born when i did what i did im sure i was a part of your inspiration and i take that as a full compliment they say you judge ones character by the company that you keep and im happy to keep company with you

5134861 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5134862 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5134863 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5134864 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5134865 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5134866 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5134867 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5134868 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5134869 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5134870 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5134871 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5134872 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5134873 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5134874 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

5134907 even if sms only offer limited possibilities because of the restriction to 160 signs in comparison to mobile internet devices there are arguments for integration in participation processes they are an easy to use feature they are cheap they can be integrated to web and vice versa looking at demoscopic data they even offer more advantages
5134908 we had some mistakes that obviously need to be corrected but we did some things we came here to do
5134909 we ran the football effectively and im pretty pleased with that we worked this week on our run game and wanted it to click early on
5134910 we had some mistakes that obviously need to be corrected but we did some things we came here to do
5134911 we ran the football effectively and im pretty pleased with that we worked this week on our run game and wanted it to click early on
5134912 without the support of my dad i would never have got back to the top in the sport i love
5134913 he is an incredible source of inspiration and i am thrilled that he can now be with me in the biggest competition of my life
5134914 dad made incredible sacrifices like increasing the mortgage to afford the travel costs equipment and boats i needed for training and competing he also spent countless hours in the shed fixing and re rigging the boats while teaching me many of the practical skills that now help me compete
5134915 i wonder if insert name here is cheating and has another girlfriend
5134916 oh my god she looks awful who wears a black thong with white pants can we say trashy
5134917 our song is on the radio on my way to work thinking of you and smiling have a good day xxx ooo
5134918 lets talk about why you were texting and driving at the same time i have seen your driving and you shouldnt be doing that
5134919 we are going to play through our entire set tomorrow start to finish even if we mess up we are just going to keep playing
5134920 i will continue to be baffled by the mima mounds
5134921 like web oriented news consumers integrators are affluent and highly educated however they are older on average than those who consider the internet their main source of news
5134922 we are excited about the launch of the ex z75 zoom the new high quality high performance edition to exilim line
5134923 families and other casual camera users enthusiastically welcomed this cameras predecessor and we are confident that they will do the same with the latest model
5134924 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5134925 this is a planning took where all things are going
5134926 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5134927 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5134928 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5134929 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5134930 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5134931 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5134932 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5134933 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5134934 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5134935 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5134936 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5134937 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5134938 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5134939 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5134940 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5134941 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5134942 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5134943 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5134944 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5134945 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5134946 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5134947 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5134948 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5134949 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5134950 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5134951 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5134952 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5134953 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5134954 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5134955 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5134956 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5134957 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5134958 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5134959 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5134960 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5134961 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5134962 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5134963 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5134964 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5134965 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5134966 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5134967 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5134968 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5134969 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5134970 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5134971 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5134972 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5134973 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5134974 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5134975 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5134976 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5134977 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5134978 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5134979 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5134980 it was like winning the lottery without having to buy a lottery ticket she said
5134981 there is no doubt that this has been an enormous fall from grace for a man that lived 61 years in an exemplary fashion judge sexton said
5134982 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5134983 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5134984 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5134985 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5134986 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5134987 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5134988 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5134989 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5134990 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5134991 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5134992 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
5134993 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5134994 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5134995 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
5134996 it would take more than one such as you for me to share that childs fate i simply inquire for my own amusement the child is held captive though its hardly a fitting chase
5134997 i didint tie her down and i wont leave her tied when i am finished with her as to fairness i care little for what is or isnt fair i would recommend you leave while im still obliged to allow you to this girl isnt going anywhere should i choose to turn my attention to yourself
5134998 the world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page
5134999 yankee go home whos leading the anti war movement congressional republicans
5135000 the press vs al gore how lazy reporting pack journalism and gop spin cost him the election
5135001 with five blokes to every girl may i suggest that beauty disadvantaged women should proceed to mount isa
5135002 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5135003 some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits really beauty is only skin deep isnt there a fairy tale about an ugly duckling that evolves into a beautiful swan
5135004 im a bloke who respects women i believe we should look after women im told men outnumber women here by five to one if thats the case then perhaps its an opportunity for some lonely women
5135005 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5135006 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5135007 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5135008 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5135009 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5135010 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5135011 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5135012 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5135013 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5135014 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5135015 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5135016 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5135017 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5135018 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5135019 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5135020 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5135021 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5135022 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5135023 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5135024 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5135025 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5135026 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5135027 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5135028 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5135029 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5135030 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5135031 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5135032 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5135033 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5135034 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5135035 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5135036 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5135037 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5135038 in the next few months growers will be informed of their water allocation for the 2008 2009 growing season ms hellams said
5135039 with water supply at critical levels there is every indication that this allocation will not increase from last year and in some cases it may be less
5135040 research shows that it is possible to grow profitable crops on reduced water supplies but management systems must change she said
5135041 growers need to know more about the exact water they need how to access additional irrigation water and understand more about the allocation decision making process
5135042 they also need to know about how to maintain the long term health of their vineyard
5135043 having more knowledge about the market empowers growers to make more strategic decisions ms hellams said
5135044 its quite possible that this lack of water could persist for a long time and growers may need to look at alternative business models or vineyard management strategies
5135045 in the next few months growers will be informed of their water allocation for the 2008 2009 growing season ms hellams said
5135046 we are once again overwhelmed by the reaction to homebake and do announce that homebake 08 peace in the park has completely sold out in record time organisers said today
5135047 once again we extend our sincerest gratitude to all who have shown their support
5135048 with such intense and surprising reaction we can at least proudly proclaim that the local music industry is well and truly in a healthy shape
5135049 we are hoping to get into patients within the next 12 months or so
5135050 we know at the moment in rat studies that our compound inhibited the development of fibrosis and the interesting thing in the future would be to see whether we can actually reverse fibrosis
5135051 currently we have some quite strong data showing that our compounds prevent fibrosis occurring
5135052 we have looked at it in a series of animal models that are very predictive of clinical outcomes hence the reason we are quite confident that our data is robust
5135053 a lot of the remodelling or the fibrosis that occurs in patients with heart attacks causes the heart to fail over the short term
5135054 if it was the first of its kind on the market it would be a huge step forward because there are currently no anti fibrotics on the market
5135055 it would be up there with some of the blockbuster drugs like the blood pressure lowering compounds it would be a huge advance in medical knowledge
5135056 que eh llorado tu amor maldito que me mata y sigo viva
5135057 everyone is entitled to their own opinion no one is entitled to their own facts
5135058 im not running for president to be somebody but to do something im running to do the hard but necessary things not the easy and needless things im running for president to protect our country from harm and defeat its enemies im running for president to make the government do its job not your job im not running to leave our biggest problems to an unluckier generation of leaders but to fix them now and fix them well
5135059 as noted in the book of revelation the of returning
5135060 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5135061 we obviously are going to have to re evaluate the direction of the strategic relationship with russia going forward and again that depends to a considerable extent on their behavior from this point forward
5135062 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5135063 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5135064 clearly as far as im concerned has the upper hand right now
5135065 i think we had seen them more as partners and there had been a lot of signals from putin that he was going to allow power to flow to stay with the president that medvedev would be in charge would be the person responsible for leading russia going forward the steps hes taken in the transition from president to prime minister in recent weeks and now certainly in georgia at least in my opinion bespeak more of putin having his hand on the steering wheel than anybody else
5135066 this looks frankly to me more like decisions made by the prime minister than by the president
5135067 if russia thought it was going to be able to bring down the georgia state bring down the democratic institutions it has failed
5135068 what theyve done instead is to bring down russias reputation as a potential and i want to emphasize potential partner in the international system
5135069 no one should try and force them back into a full relationship with georgia
5135070 if the russians intended this as intimidation they have done nothing but harden the attitudes of the small states around them
5135071 i think the russians have made a significant mistake here
5135072 it strikes me as pretty strident rhetoric and probably fairly empty rhetoric
5135073 the truth of the matter is russia is not going to launch nuclear missiles at anybody the poles know that we know it
5135074 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5135075 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
5135076 were not selling them we give them free to the people
5135077 we didnt come to cause trouble we just came to bring bibles to help out the chinese christians
5135078 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5135079 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission
5135080 99 of leadership development programs offered by elite business schools are male oriented which is precisely why they fail when it comes to leadership learning for women
5135081 it was a great time and i highly recommend political vindication radio for anyone interested in some solid political talk radio
5135082 i enjoyed the show thoroughly frank and shane are solid hosts and asked some questions that i really enjoyed answering
5135083 that was so much fun and i have to say you guys are real pros almost intimidating youre so good at it
5135084 let me say it was a pleasure to talk to you guys and be asked such important and intelligent questions

5135098 within the next 24 or 48 hours on a deal that would see the nrl club end legal action against the rugby league star who fled australia for france three weeks ago only one year into his five year contract with the bulldogs
5135099 the final documentation is being prepared by our legal team he said

5135103 channel 7 had a very deliberate strategy with the yum cha program and that was to dumb it down in order to make it digestible for non sporting viewers
5135104 everything on that program was scripted and sonia has executed the strategy exactly how seven wanted it to play out
5135105 i havent checked but im betting pete baker on slugger has got there ahead of me

5135112 some people who spend a lot of time thinking about popular music try awfully hard not to associate themselves with other people who spend a lot of time thinking about popular music
5135113 they care about the people now the people care about them
5135114 im writing the obituary right now ive done a few of these in my time but i really am having a hard time with this one where do you start
5135115 it certainly is going to make for a lonely forest
5135116 with someone like him so interwoven in the fabric of my life it will take some time for me to sort everything out one thing for certain life will never be the same for me to be with him was always a joy he made me laugh
5135117 when so many people helped him back then he vowed he would spend the rest of his days helping others and he did
5135118 he did so many things for so many people no one will ever know about all of it no way as one of his best friends for me his passing leaves nothing but heartache
5135119 he was one heck of a fighter in this battle he fought right to the end he never gave up hell always be remembered as a pillar of the community a hard worker and a very generous person he was also someone who just loved to hunt and fish
5135120 dwayne is going to be remembered for a very very long time this is a man who always had an open door and an open heart for anyone who needed anything he was always there now we have to find a church big enough to hold everybody it wont be easy
5135121 dwayne was so gracious to allow his facility to sponsor that event but that was him he was a great role model of what it means to give back to your community
5135122 he and i spent many hours talking about fathers and sons it was always a pleasure to be in his company dwayne terwey will be greatly missed he was very special to this community we all owe him so much so very much

5135131 mccain answers questions by telling stories obama answers like an academic i think people like storytellers better than professors they will like mccains simple yes and no responses obama tries to show he would be a good leader by recognizing nuance and complexity mccain tries to show he would be a good leader by being decisive
5135132 to grant that abortion is a moral issue but to duck when human life begins is at best inconsistent one would think it is vital no pun intended to think though exactly that question obamas unguarded line about not punishing a daughter of his with a child really hurt him in the pro life movement

5135134 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective
5135135 answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5135136 obama will be hammered by the religious right for that pay grade answer
5135137 specious obama has made that very determination in opening the law wide to the killing of the unborn
5135138 specifically says that neither biologists nor doctors nor theologians can agree upon the moral status of the fetus
5135139 absolute certainty that the woman herself does have moral status then the conservative thing to do is to protect the womans interests first

5135141 if he believes in human rights at the moment of conception then he ought to be against embryonic stem cell research ivf and even the so called rhythm method
5135142 which has the effect of timing intercourse not only to prevent conception but also to allow conception at a time when the fertilized egg will drop into a uterus that is not at the right time of month for implantation
5135143 evaded the question of whether he will or will not continue to support embryonic stem cell research as long as the scientists say it is necessary
5135144 odd not to ask it after all if you are going to talk to someone about religion youd be interested to know their thoughts about the central figure in their religion
5135145 is why there were not representatives from other faith communities who are also voting this is a multi religious nation
5135146 personal testimony and scripture citation are both treasured by evangelicals

5135149 what needs to be done is to cut back public spending massively sell off all the useless semi states and get rid of all these useless quangos

5135224 despite economic fears and a tightening on consumer spend mobile phone shipments in the united states reached 41 9 million units during 2q08 up 5 3 percent from 39 8 million in 2q07 attractive bundling schemes from operators and a number of new handset launches from vendors kept replacement rates at a healthy level
5135225 motorola had a good quarter and retained its number one position in the united states with a 25 8 percent marketshare motorolas strong distribution network and deep carrier relationships proved crucial in maintaining share in both gsm and cdma markets motorola is not yet out of the woods but these are encouraging early signs of stabilization
5135226 while operators understandably dont want to be perceived as trying to unfairly glean excess revenues from unwitting subscribers while abroad taking a one size fits all approach blocking their usage while abroad will result in them losing very significant revenues at a time when you would expect them to be looking to maximise their 3g network investments even though there is the suggestion that subscribers would be able to lift the block for a high proportion this would be too disruptive and operators would never maximise their average revenue per user arpu
5135227 in a competitive european market where operators are increasingly trying to differentiate their service and the many millions of corporate subscribers are becoming increasingly international operators surely have no choice but to ensure they maximise all mobile broadband revenue opportunities whilst offering subscribers the best possible service

5135259 all the imams are infallible just like the prophets the shia derive their religion from their immaculate imams
5135260 by listening to the voice of a person the imams can tell if the person was destined to go to hell or to heaven they would thus answer his questions accordingly
5135261 the imams know when they will die and they do not die except by their own choice
5135262 the imams have knowledge of whatever occurred in the past and whatever will happen in the future and nothing is concealed from them
5135263 the imams have knowledge of all the revealed books regardless of the languages in which they were revealed
5135264 no one compiled the quran completely except the imams and they encompass all of its knowledge
5135265 when the imams time comes they will rule in accordance with the ruling of the prophet david and his dynasty these imams will not need to ask for presentation of evidence before passing their judgments
5135266 the almighty god has placed his trust in aale e muhammad descendants of muhammad may the peace of god be upon them they are strongholds where his commandments receive protection and from which they are expounded and interpreted they are fountain heads of knowledge created by him shelters for his teachings refuges for heavenly books mountain like citadels to defend his religion islam in its beginning was weak and helpless they came to its help and defence islam was nervous of the infidels around it they made it strong and powerful

5135317 we are hoping to get into patients within the next 12 months or so
5135318 we know at the moment in rat studies that our compound inhibited the development of fibrosis and the interesting thing in the future would be to see whether we can actually reverse fibrosis
5135319 currently we have some quite strong data showing that our compounds prevent fibrosis occurring
5135320 we have looked at it in a series of animal models that are very predictive of clinical outcomes hence the reason we are quite confident that our data is robust
5135321 a lot of the remodelling or the fibrosis that occurs in patients with heart attacks causes the heart to fail over the short term
5135322 if it was the first of its kind on the market it would be a huge step forward because there are currently no anti fibrotics on the market
5135323 the banks are just holding their head above water and bhp is down a bit but its annual report is coming out today and thats expected to be pretty robust he said
5135324 historically public services were delivered by the man from the ministry who was white and heterosexual and got the 4 30pm train back to tunbridge wells every afternoon ben summerskill said
5135325 this move by mi5 is recognition that the establishment is changing and slowly becoming more reflective of wider society
5135326 now he thinks that natalie heard the dinghy banging loosely against the splendor went to fix it and slipped on the swim step knocking herself unconscious and rolled into the water and the dinghy just floated away
5135327 there was no conspiracy nobody walking in on something sexual nothing absurd like that
5135328 he writes that he went through the inquest in a daze and after that he took to his bed for eight days in a catatonic state blaming himself for her death hes never entirely recovered but how can you
5135329 eighty six percent of the respondents to the voice of the voter survey conducted by the herald journal and newschannel 7 indicated that they want stronger laws that channel development and protect neighborhoods
5135330 an overwhelming majority 71 percent also stated that they want county governments to enact zoning only 14 percent oppose zoning
5135331 but spartanburg county leaders have not responded not only have they refused to adopt any of the zoning models that have worked well in other areas of the state they have refused to significantly improve the countys existing land use ordinances
5135332 the pitcher ann silvestro m1 cal gage inspect and pack was cited throughout the season for her tricky fastball which she mastered by practicing at home
5135333 in my experience women who have it done do better its prevention of suffering
5135334 she had to have t he newest of this and that
5135335 i trusted her for 19 years her systematic stealing is such an intense betrayal
5135336 i knew her husband was a vietnam vet on disability and i thought maybe thats where their money comes from but i had no idea how much money they had
5135337 due to her mastery of bookkeeping and accounts she had sufficient knowledge of the financial data to mislead
5135338 even when she bought her house she wasnt happy because she didnt want to live in lowell
5135339 the fleurys werent squandering the stolen money on lavish vacations fancy cars or a high off the hog lifestyle but were rather providing for everyday needs which they otherwise would have to go without
5135340 working class family who wrongly and criminally used an opportunity to live a dignified and comfortable life
5135341 had it done so the fraud perpetrated by fleury would have been detected as early as 1998
5135342 due to the negligence of keegan as a result of her negligent supervision
5135343 i am deeply sorry for the pain i have caused and the poor financial situation i have put you in
5135344 i have let you down and i dont expect forgiveness i am ashamed and embarrassed
5135345 even after she natalie fleury left creditors were calling the office looking for her
5135346 i wish i had been more suspicious i liked her and trusted her
5135347 lets just drop this its a pointless conversation and honestly its hurting my feelings
5135348 show me your junk show me your junk everyones already seen my boobs boys now show me your junk
5135349 he wanted to help get children away from a life of crime and violence
5135350 thats why hes the king of comedy he never lost his soul in chicago

5135352 he always had time to shake a hand he was always that kid from chicago who wanted to make everybody happy and everybody laugh

5135362 in the next few months growers will be informed of their water allocation for the 2008 2009 growing season ms hellams said
5135363 with water supply at critical levels there is every indication that this allocation will not increase from last year and in some cases it may be less
5135364 research shows that it is possible to grow profitable crops on reduced water supplies but management systems must change she said
5135365 growers need to know more about the exact water they need how to access additional irrigation water and understand more about the allocation decision making process
5135366 they also need to know about how to maintain the long term health of their vineyard
5135367 having more knowledge about the market empowers growers to make more strategic decisions ms hellams said
5135368 it was like winning the lottery without having to buy a lottery ticket she said

5135382 you have to question whose interests cheney is looking after and whether privatization has really benefited the department of defense or the defense contractors like brown amp root
5135383 we are talking about nepotism of the highest order and profiteering at the expense of the us taxpayers
5135384 compare that with average corporate profit percentages which are about three percent
5135385 it doesnt take a soldier to do what brown amp root does for the army

5135469 zelfs als ik niet in de halve finales had gezeten ik heb geprobeerd mijn eigen wedstrijd te lopen maar 50 meter van het einde dacht ik dat ik tweede lag en heb ik gedurende een paar meters wat meer ontspannen misschien heb ik daar een honderdste verloren waardoor ik niet rechtstreeks geplaatst was ik was heel nerveus ik heb ook niet geslapen voor middernacht en ben nog enkele keren wakker geworden goed dat de halve finales s avonds geprogrammeerd staan
5135470 maar 9u00 s morgens is wel heel vroeg ik begrijp niet waarom ze de 400 meter op zon uur programmeren ik heb wel geslapen maar niet ideaal bovendien moest ik in de eerste reeks lopen dus die die na mij komen hebben meer rust gehad ik eindig heel dicht bij de derde plaats die recht geeft op directe kwalificatie maar in zon wedstrijd als deze speelt de ervaring nog mee denk ik

5135506 all the italian boats were faster than the new zealand boats
5135507 in my position i wasnt going to say you cant have them
5135508 i wanted the athletes to have the best possible tools its no good having world class athletes if you havent got the best possible boats
5135509 hell be back i reflect on the effort of cyclist sarah ulmer in sydney in 2000 where she was ill and she won in athens mahe can do that as well

5135515 the united states has long maintained the option of preemptive actions to counter a sufficient threat to our national security the greater the threat the greater is the risk of inaction and the more compelling the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves even if uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemys attack to forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries the united states will if necessary act preemptively

5135542 its pretty clear to anyone looking at the research that if firms lower environmental risks theyll be able to raise equity capital more cheaply
5135543 obviously if cost of capital goes down its a great benefit
5135544 weve broadened the ability of firms to make an argument for environmental efforts

5135559 were hoping for the best and if everything goes according to plans espn2 will have footage they can use this weekend well rotate it around to different cars and use every angle we can think of to bring the viewers inside the cockpit it should be really cool

5135565 i knew that when hes 100 percent healthy he can score hes getting fitter and stronger and hopefully it can continue

5135574 the same old folks that brought you george w bush the same team
5135575 they say this other guy is unpatriotic or this guy likes french people thats what they said about kerry
5135576 they try to make it out like democrats arent tough enough arent macho enough its the same strategy
5135577 john mccain has never questioned sen obamas patriotism but he clearly does question sen obamas experience and judgment and they do have profound differences of opinion on the best way to reduce our dependence on mideast oil bring jobs back to america and keep our nation safe

5135579 a few years ago the japanese feed industry recognized the constraint of increasing ddgs inclusion rates in pelleted feed formulations and requested more information about manufacturing fine pellets with ddgs

5135587 i think we take for granted the fact weve been on top of the game for i dont know how many olympics weve dominated for so long and now were getting a pretty good taste of what its like at the bottom
5135588 i should have gone with the start that was really a rookie mistake
5135589 i knew in my mind ok it was a false start i got stuck out there 11 2 is so mediocre its ridiculous
5135590 i knew at least one of us would be in the mix

5135592 i can hit some and i can field some but i want to work on doing everything consistently
5135593 another step in the long slog toward bringing common sense to olympic tv
5135594 none of the polish and packaging that youd get from the folks at nbc not much history or background on the contestants beyond where in china they were born and certainly no visits to hometowns and no proud teary eyed parent

5135597 out there that needs your help as much as you need hers i thanked god today for allowing me to serve him and for allowing

5135620 i wrote beautiful one while i was on holiday we had been ministering in australia and had a few days o ff at the great barrier reef i read that passage in isaiah that talks about the messiah as having no beauty that would attract us to him nothing to make us think how incredible he was that description of him as the suffering servant really struck me because we often talk about jesus being glorious awesome incredible he is the son of god all knowing all conquering all powerful what humility he gave up everything to come walk among us on the earth we would have passed him on the street and not thought anything of who he was but we know how beautiful he is and we often sing about that attribute in more of an intimate slow tender way i thought to sing beautiful one as a strong powerful statement in a more upbeat declarative way was a wonderful thing that we as christians could do

5135678 tens of thousands of subprime borrowers will face higher payments on their adjustable rate mortgages
5135679 it has a lot of character we saw the potential in it
5135680 we saw the writing on the wall and it didnt look pretty
5135681 its ultimately a correction to a market that went crazy too long
5135682 during the hot housing market people sold junk for top dollar and people paid top dollar for junk

5135684 if youre struggling look for ways to reduce your household budget

5135687 keep in mind farming cooking and gardening are closely linked
5135688 many southern men can raise the best tomatoes you have ever tasted or make the most incredible pulled pork barbecue youve ever eaten
5135689 you have to accept the other woman in his life his mama like it or not shes the woman a southern man will compare every other woman in his life to including you
5135690 most southern men really want to open the door for you because thats what mama taught them women deserve
5135691 allow him to be the gentleman he was raised by his mother to be
5135692 he has been taught to always follow the southern unspoken rules of conduct
5135693 in short act like a lady southern men like soft voices and gentle manners
5135694 learn how to make a good plate of fried chicken and biscuits or if you dont cook buy them ready made and serve on your favorite serving dish but dont tell
5135695 learn as much as you can about country music and know the basics of nascar
5135696 never insult his family including the dog no matter what old moss is clinging to the family tree keep any criticisms to yourself because southern men are fiercely protective of their families regardless of how nutty their relatives may be
5135697 no matter what he does a southern man takes pride in his job
5135698 a southern man may have few words but he has a lot of love and wisdom to share
5135699 think of all those rough but handsome southern guys singing country songs so sad theyd make a statue cry even if its deep down southern men intensely feel emotions especially when it comes to the people they love
5135700 we thought that they would die before we had to fire them doctors tell us any minute now were keeping our fingers crossed
5135701 the process of unmik reconfiguration has begun without consent of all interested parties and without explicit approval by the u n security council
5135702 explicitly confirmed by the u n security council thereby winning full international legality
5135703 in order for it to assume an enhanced operational role in kosovo in the area of the rule of law under the overall authority of the united nations
5135704 if we were to eliminate those two obstacles by the end of this year or the middle of the next year serbia would for the first time since 2000 be in a situation to have a clear and open path to europe
5135705 how repetition made me a starr actually just star i was already a starr because that was my last name but seriously repetition is important
5135706 so youre telling me that the packers are willing to pay a retired superstar quarterback 20 million to stay retired
5135707 well hot dog i need to get my old ass up to green bay ill stay retired for half that
5135708 cash strapped bart starr wondering how much packers will pay him to stay retired
5135709 it could happen to anyone when i was scouting pudge i was using old information were still happy to have him though i think

5135713 so it was a little disappointing to find it was only hershey kisses broccoflower and entrails
5135714 when you go out there to pitch to a great lineup like the cubs have you realize its possible they might beat you around
5135715 but what you dont expect is to get hung upside down covered in paper mache and beat mercilessly with plastic sticks by blindfolded middle aged men until you shoot out what youve got in you well i mean at least not on a weekday and not without a safety word
5135716 cubs beat on brewers like so many big fat pinatas
5135717 how can you pay attention to two books at the same time
5135718 they regard us as freaks when we point out illiterate mistakes we are often aggressively instructed to get a life but people who interestingly display no evidence of having lives themselves
5135719 punctuation has been defined in many ways some grammarians use the analogy of stitching punctuation as the basting that holds the fabric of language in shape
5135720 stand outside a leicester square cinema indicating with a cut out apostrophe on a stick how the title two weeks notice might be easily grammatically corrected i did this and not a soul will take your side or indeed have a clue what your problem is
5135721 so what i propose is action sticklers unite you have nothing to lose but your sense of proportion and arguably you didnt have a lot of that to begin with maybe we wont change the world but at least well fee better
5135722 in the family of punctuation where the full stop is daddy and the comma is mummy and the semi colon quietly practises the piano with crossed hands the exclamation mark is the big attention deficit brother who gets over excited and breaks things and laughs too loudly
5135723 a sinister painting imbued with the vengeful spirit of a former owner
5135724 warbeck hall is an old fashioned english country house and the scene of equally english murders all the classic ingredients are there christmas decorations tea and cake a faithful butler a foreigner snow falling and an interesting cast of characters thrown together the murders and detective work are far from conventional though

5135804 when your daddy and i were in graduate school together we knew a man with your name and he was a really nice guy just like you are so right away we kind of liked the name
5135805 youre daddy and i went out to lunch at a restaurant in the city this restaurant made their very own brand of beer called snags ale they even had coasters they served your drinks on theyd bring your glass of iced tea or soda or beer or whatever you ordered to drink and put it on a coaster that said snags ale ale by the way is a kind of beer anyway when we saw the coaster it reminded us again how much we liked the name snags and i even took one of those coasters home with me
5135806 we even have these glasses like the one you are drinking out of that we bought from that very same restaurant and the glass as you can see says snags ale on it so you have drinking glasses with your name on it
5135807 remember your daddy and i liked the name snags there was that nice man at graduate school and oh also there is a character in a movie with your name and its a good movie too and so when we saw the coaster with the name of the beer on it it just reminded us that we liked the name snags so you see we didnt really name you after a beer

5135812 im a bloke who respects women i believe we should look after women im told men outnumber women here by five to one if thats the case then perhaps its an opportunity for some lonely women
5135813 in the next few months growers will be informed of their water allocation for the 2008 2009 growing season ms hellams said
5135814 with water supply at critical levels there is every indication that this allocation will not increase from last year and in some cases it may be less
5135815 research shows that it is possible to grow profitable crops on reduced water supplies but management systems must change she said
5135816 growers need to know more about the exact water they need how to access additional irrigation water and understand more about the allocation decision making process
5135817 they also need to know about how to maintain the long term health of their vineyard
5135818 having more knowledge about the market empowers growers to make more strategic decisions ms hellams said

5135854 barack obama is directly contrary to many positions and beliefs of martin luther king jr
5135855 obama is trying to make african americans believe he is the reality of the dream come true but hes not its a nightmare
5135856 senator obamas answer to the ills of society of higher government spending weaker national defense continued tax dollars to planned parenthood and support of gay marriage are diametrically opposed to everything african americans truly believe and an anathema to the dream of dr martin luther king jr
5135857 it is high time for black america white america and all america to stop making their ethnicity such a big deal that we become zealous for our color over being zealous for what is right and what is truth
5135858 i will not remain silent out of fear of repercussions because it is politically incorrect for blacks to challenge blacks
5135859 intimidation because many people are afraid to scrutinize obama and speak out because of the race issue
5135860 in reality he is not a black american his heritage is muslim not african american
5135861 does not remotely parallel the values traditions and struggles of black america
5135862 to look deeper at barack obama the man his voting record and his position on the important issues facing our country
5135863 it is obvious obama is trying to solidify the black vote
5135864 we can talk about poverty we can talk about the war we can talk about teen pregnancy we can talk about incarceration however if were not allowed to live well never encounter those issues

5135868 life was very precious to my uncle and life today is precious
5135869 lie in a new direction that reflects our core beliefs and values not merely a resemblance of someone we look like
5135870 there comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe nor politic nor popular but one must take it because it is right
5135871 this is not the time to be silent this is not the time to give barack obama a free pass there is too much at stake
5135872 i think you are going to get a kick out of this but i must have misdialed your number just now when i attempted to return your call
5135873 when i called i asked for donna reed the guy on the other end said oh well shes dead
5135874 i said she cant be i just got off the phone with her a few minutes ago

5135876 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5135877 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
5135878 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
5135879 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
5135880 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5135881 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5135882 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5135883 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
5135884 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
5135885 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5135886 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5135887 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

5135898 i saw two squads of rebels near the our church and we immediately hid on the second floor on the convent
5135899 this incident could be connected to the failure of the signing of the ancestral domain deal and many rebels are disgruntled we are trying to reach commander bravo but we cannot get through him this fighting should stop we dont want the fighting to spread to other areas

5136010 apart from the continuing impact from poor investment markets count remains in good shape with no debt a strong and stable professional network and with senior management unchanged it said

5136039 this is something we all dream about as kids and to have it actually happen is amazing
5136040 i was thinking this might be the year i broke through and got a win but at six shots back i didnt think much about it
5136041 i just tried to play the best i could i honestly didnt expect to win at all but thats how golf goes its four rounds 72 holes and anything can happen
5136042 its happened to me and whoever in golf there are no guarantees youre leading by seven strokes five strokes it doesnt matter she played well and i know she was expecting a great situation but shes 19 years old this will probably be a great experience for her
5136043 it probably will be overshadowed by the olympics especially with the aussies doing so well in swimming
5136044 but its great sport is such a huge part of our culture i hope it gets coverage down there because we need to raise the profile of womens golf participation has actually been declining in the last five years the more aussies that do well the better the game is going to get
5136045 i feel like i gained a lot of confidence in myself again this year

5136069 how can providers get credentialed and licensed to practice out of state
5136070 a lot of patients end up doing better in the long run with specialized care and remote exams can give us the same findings as at the bedside

5136097 whose ultimate aim shall be the reconstruction of society in accordance with the highest moral possibilities
5136098 social conditions in england with a view to social reconstruction or development
5136099 a sort of outspoken secret society an informal and open freemasonry
5136100 the establishment of the economic world state by the deliberate invitation explicit discussion and cooperation of the men most interested in economic organization men chosen by their work called to it by a natural disposition and aptitude for it fully aware of its importance and working with the support of an increasing general understanding it is not a project to overthrow existing governments by insurrectionary attacks but to supersede them by disregard it does not want to destroy them or alter their forms but to make them negligible by replacing their functions it will respect them as far as it must what is useful of them it will use what is useless it will efface by its stronger reality it will join issue only with what is plainly antagonistic and actively troublesome
5136101 an intelligent minority without the support of the crowd and possibly in spite of its dissent
5136102 functional men men of high natural intelligence and professional competence who performed the creative and managerial work of the world
5136103 the men and women whose knowledge skill creative gifts made them indispensable to modern society
5136104 formation of small groups of friends family groups groups of students and employees or other sorts of people meeting and conversing frequently in the course of normal occupations
5136105 enlarge themselves and attempt to establish communications with kindred groups for common ends
5136106 the open conspiracy will appear first i believe as a conscious organization of intelligent and in some cases wealthy men as a movement having distinct social and political aims confessedly ignoring most of the existing apparatus of political control or using it only as an incidental implement in the stages a mere movement of a number of people in a certain direction who will presently discover with a sort of surprise the common object toward which they are all moving in all sorts of ways they will be influencing and controlling the ostensible government
5136107 branching and development with the open conspiracy as consisting of a great multitude and variety of overlapping groups but now all organized for collective political social and educational as well as propagandist action they will recognize each other much more clearly than they did at first and they will have acquired a common name the character of the open conspiracy will now be plainly displayed it will have become a great world movement as widespread and evident as socialism and communism it will largely have taken the place of these movements it will be more it will be a world religion this large loose assimilatory mass of groups and societies will be definitely and obviously attempting to swallow up the entire population of the world and become the new human community
5136108 as civilization becomes more complex and as the need for invisible government has been increasingly demonstrated the technical means have been invented and developed by which public opinion may be regimented with printing press and newspaper the telephone telegraph radio and airplanes ideas can be spread rapidly and even instantaneously across the whole of america
5136109 without breach of continuity or abrupt change of the entire social issue
5136110 stealth intrigue subversion and the deception of never calling socialism by its right name
5136111 an intelligent interest in socialism among college men and women
5136112 education for a new social order based on production for use and not for profit
5136113 secret society with but one object the furtherance of the british empire and the bringing of the whole uncivilized world under british rule for the recovery of the united states and for making the anglo saxon race but one empire
5136114 in his first will rhodes states his aim still more specifically the extension of british rule throughout the world the foundation of so great a power as to hereafter render wars impossible and promote the interests of humanity
5136115 a ruling class with a powerful army to keep it in power and a society completely subordinate to the monolithic authority of the rulers
5136116 it is our duty to seize every opportunity of acquiring more territory more territory simply means more of the anglo saxon race more of the best the most human most honorable race the world possesses the absorption of the greater portion of the world under our rule simply means the end of all wars
5136117 men should strive to build the kingdom of heaven here upon this earth and that the leadership in that task must fall first and foremost upon the english speaking peoples
5136118 high ranking officers of banking manufacturing trading and finance companies together with many lawyers concerned primarily with the effect that the war and the treaty of peace might have on post war business
5136119 to coordinate the international activities and outlooks of all the english speaking world into one to work to maintain peace to help backward colonial and underdeveloped areas to advance towards stability law and order and prosperity along the lines somehow similar to those taught at oxford and the university of london
5136120 serious discussion of international affairs by leading citizens in widely separated communities
5136121 provided an avenue for extending the council to every part of the country
5136122 the council on foreign relations is a non profit institution devoted to the study of the international aspects of american political economic and strategic problems it takes no stand expressed or implied on american policy
5136123 the substance of the provisions finally written into the un charter in many cases reflected conclusions reached at much earlier stages by the united states government
5136124 from that day forward the council on foreign relations had placed its members in policy making positions with the federal government not limited to the state department
5136125 the representatives of the american people in congress should speedily proceed to transfer the ownership of the 12 federal reserve banks from the private ownership of the member banks to the ownership of the nation itself
5136126 the high office of president has been used to foment a plot to destroy the americans freedom and before i leave office i must inform the citizen of this plight
5136127 for some time i have been disturbed by the way the cia has been diverted from its original assignment
5136128 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist we must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes
5136129 to splinter the cia in a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds
5136130 silver certificates against any silver bullion silver or standard silver dollars in the treasury not then held for redemption of any outstanding silver certificates to prescribe the denominations of such silver certificates and to coin standard silver dollars and subsidiary silver currency for their redemption
5136131 we in washington will at last be able to provide government that is truly for the people i realize that what i am asking is that not only the executive branch but even the congress will have to change by giving up some of its power
5136132 admitting red china to the united nations would be a mockery of the provision of the charter which limits its membership to peace loving nations
5136133 people of the world to unite and defeat the u s aggressors and all their running dogs
5136134 were going to attempt to get initial indictments of some high officials using this as a launching board to get public opinion in their favor and using the press media to a great degree the objective was to reverse the outcome of the public election
5136135 were names that everyone would recognize who held extremely high posts in past administrations
5136136 deceived the president of the united states into joining a conspiracy to obstruct justice in order to cover up a crime that nixon had not committed
5136137 the truth is i dont know who i am burying
5136138 as a result of my work on this case i became convinced that the imperial family was alive
5136139 sir william wiseman a partner in the new york banking house of kuhn loeb amp co
5136140 the imperial family had first been taken to a monastery in the province of perm and later to denmark
5136141 part that i dont think i can talk about i just havent figured out a way to talk about it and protect everyone im not saying that anyone helped me plan it im not just saying that there are other things which means there are other people though not in terms of a conspiracy there are areas im not willing to talk about for a lot of reasons
5136142 added to the air of mystery surrounding her case and sealed all the trial evidence
5136143 mr nixon would obviously like to preside over the creation of a new world order and believes he sees an opportunity to do so in the last twenty months of his first term
5136144 in the face of a vote to impeach he might try as commander in chief to use military forces to keep himself in power
5136145 he kept on referring to the fact that he may be the last hope that the eastern elite was out to get him he kept saying this is our last and best hope the last chance to resist the fascists of the left his words brought me straight up out of my chair i felt the president without the words having been said was trying to sound us out to see if we would support him in some extra constitutional action secretary of defense james schlesinger began to investigate what forces could be assembled at his order as a counterweight to the marines if nixon in a crisis chose to subvert the constitution the notion that nixon could at any time resort to extraordinary steps to preserve his presidency was far more widespread in the government than the public perceived
5136146 defense secretary james schlesinger requested a tight watch in the military chain of command to ensure that no extraordinary orders went out from the white house during the period of uncertainty and that no commanders of any forces should carry out orders which came from the white house or elsewhere outside the normal military channels
5136147 upon receipt of this message you will no longer carry out any orders from the white house acknowledge receipt
5136148 the kind of international system which we should be seeking to nudge things
5136149 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
5136150 the members of the council are persons of much more than average influence in the community they have used the prestige that their wealth their social position and their education have given them to lead their country towards bankruptcy and military debacle they should look at their hands there is blood on them the dried blood of the last war and the fresh blood of the present one
5136151 the most powerful clique in these cfr groups have one objective in common they want to bring about the surrender of the sovereignty and the national independence of the u s they want to end national boundaries and racial and ethnic loyalties supposedly in increase business and ensure world peace what they strive for would inevitably lead to dictatorship and loss of freedoms by the people the cfr was founded for the purpose of promoting disarmament and submergence of u s sovereignty and national independence into an all powerful one world government
5136152 the directors of the cfr make up a sort of presidium for that part of the establishment that guides our destiny as a nation
5136153 the cfr dedicated to one world government financed by a number of the largest tax exempt foundations and wielding such power and influence over our lives in the areas of finance business labor military education and mass communication media should be familiar to every american concerned with good government and with preserving and defending the u s constitution and our free enterprise system yet the nations right to know machinery the news media usually so aggressive in exposures to inform our people remain conspicuously silent when it comes to the cfr its members and their activities the cfr is the establishment not only does it have influence and power in key decision making positions at the highest levels of government to apply pressure from above but it also finances and uses individuals and groups to bring pressure from below to justify the high level decisions for converting the u s from a sovereign constitutional republic into a servile member state of a one world dictatorship
5136154 purpose of promoting disarmament and submergence of u s sovereignty and national independence into an all powerful one world government is the only objective revealed to about 95 percent of 1 551 members 1975 figures there are two other ulterior purposes that cfr influence is being used to promote but it is improbable that they are known to more than 75 members or that these purposes ever have even been identified in writing
5136155 most powerful clique in these elitist groups have one objective in common they want to bring about the surrender of the sovereignty and the national independence of the united states
5136156 once the ruling members of the cfr have decided that the u s government should adopt a particular policy the very substantial research facilities of cfr are put to work to develop arguments intellectual and emotional to support the new policy and to confound and discredit intellectually and politically any opposition
5136157 the councils membership includes some of the most influential men in government business education and the press and for nearly half a century has made substantial contributions to the basic concepts of american foreign policy
5136158 the council counts among its members probably more important names in american life than any other private group in the country
5136159 if you want to make foreign policy theres no better fraternity to belong to than the council
5136160 when a new president comes on board there is a great turnover in personnel but no change in policy
5136161 those of us who had worked for the kennedy election were tolerated in the government for that reason and had a say but foreign policy was still with the council on foreign relations people

5136184 people just didnt want to spend taxpayer money on historical things things were just overlooked

5136201 it gives us great comfort that we fulfilled normas wish and so many people were helped
5136202 all six people who received organs are doing really well
5136203 i like being able to talk to people like oshea because you get to thank them
5136204 just for the basics of supplies a backpack and a lunch bag on average it would probably run about 80 100 just for that and thats really watching it thats no extras thats probably not even everything thats on the list
5136205 when the children come out of school in june they have a list usually coming home for what they need the next year and the lists are getting longer and longer before it was the basics looseleaf pencils crayons now theres things like headphones for computer class and things like kleenex and hand sanitary wipes
5136206 people have to know that with this program we do our big push right now and we get kids back to school but the back to school program really goes on all year because we always have parents come in in january february because theyve run out of looseleaf theyve run out pencils so were there all year round to help them out

5136211 we are hoping to get into patients within the next 12 months or so
5136212 we know at the moment in rat studies that our compound inhibited the development of fibrosis and the interesting thing in the future would be to see whether we can actually reverse fibrosis
5136213 currently we have some quite strong data showing that our compounds prevent fibrosis occurring
5136214 we have looked at it in a series of animal models that are very predictive of clinical outcomes hence the reason we are quite confident that our data is robust
5136215 a lot of the remodelling or the fibrosis that occurs in patients with heart attacks causes the heart to fail over the short term
5136216 if it was the first of its kind on the market it would be a huge step forward because there are currently no anti fibrotics on the market
5136217 it would be up there with some of the blockbuster drugs like the blood pressure lowering compounds it would be a huge advance in medical knowledge
5136218 there is no doubt that this has been an enormous fall from grace for a man that lived 61 years in an exemplary fashion judge sexton said

5136220 once again we extend our sincerest gratitude to all who have shown their support
5136221 with such intense and surprising reaction we can at least proudly proclaim that the local music industry is well and truly in a healthy shape

5136232 its hosted on a website and its there for everyone to see
5136233 hes been very truthful and to me thats the only way you can find common ground
5136234 we have probably failed to understand that the russians are really quite serious when they say we have interests and were going to defend them
5136235 russia does have interests and at some point theyre going to stand up and draw lines that are not simply to be ignored
5136236 deaths dont happen that much down here and three in one day is very devastating

5136239 apparently he was a very capable skier its believed he may have clipped another persons ski which caused him to go off course it was just an accident its one of those very unfortunate things

5136241 national has concluded that gas will be a critical part of the generation mix
5136242 we believe this policy will be positive for vector as embedded or close to market gas generation at rodney and otahuhu will be constructed
5136243 we see this as positive for contact through its geothermal strategy and trustpower through its hydro and wind development portfolio
5136244 no details of the scheme are outlined we believe this will be a very tough process politically for national and is unlikely to be successful given that labour will have failed twice in its endeavours to introduce emission trading legislation
5136245 you get to run out there wearing the uniform of the world champions its an awesome feeling to live that out hopefully this time ill be running on the field and actually snapping the ball
5136246 you have your ups and your downs you just have to go with it and be positive about everything
5136247 ive learned a lot and im better than i was a month ago but theres still a lot more to improve on and hopefully ill get back that confidence that i had when i was at kentucky right now im kind of low with that because of not knowing the offense as well
5136248 but its hard for a guy thats not getting as many reps as the top three quarterbacks to show what he can or cant do
5136249 andre hes a rookie quarterback first time into the nfl and weve all been there and he asks some good questions which is good
5136250 if he doesnt understand something hes stepping up and asking questions which is important for a young quarterback you try to explain things so he understands it
5136251 he is like a lot of young quarterbacks he has it all upstairs as far as what the plays are but he is still working on being able to pull it out
5136252 its been a while so ill probably look a little rusty but im just excited to have this chance to showcase what i have
5136253 hopefully im in there for a while but if not then i still got a chance
5136254 you got to take care of this to move on
5136255 you cant look at this game and think we played well and were going to move on its about what we do in two days
5136256 they hit a lot of threes and love to drive and kick out for the open shot
5136257 i just happen to be in the right place at the right time
5136258 i actually thought that i missed a lot of shots early that i usually hit
5136259 i think most of us grew up watching these girls i think i was 10 years old when lisa leslie played in her first olympics it was a good experience i think we played pretty well all things considered
5136260 i knew i was out there for the right reasons
5136261 obviously a lot of things have gone on the last few months im not going to sit here and say i havent second guessed decisions not only this year but along the way one thing i know for sure when i step on the field as i did tonight i knew i made the right decision
5136262 what ive been telling people is while he throws the ball pretty hard he can make all the throws
5136263 he has a lot more touch than people think he can do the touch passes he can zip it in there
5136264 it is crazy i mean catching a touchdown pass from a living legend
5136265 a guy that is definitely a hall of famer its overwhelming to be honest
5136266 he did a nice job for being around for a short period of time it just shows his expertise at the quarterback position
5136267 if he says hey brett ill let you play as long as you want im all for it
5136268 you have to get your feet wet somehow theres no substitute for game type situations im sure well talk about it this week but believe me from my end ready or not i need to be in there

5136291 in the next few months growers will be informed of their water allocation for the 2008 2009 growing season ms hellams said
5136292 with water supply at critical levels there is every indication that this allocation will not increase from last year and in some cases it may be less
5136293 research shows that it is possible to grow profitable crops on reduced water supplies but management systems must change she said
5136294 growers need to know more about the exact water they need how to access additional irrigation water and understand more about the allocation decision making process
5136295 they also need to know about how to maintain the long term health of their vineyard
5136296 having more knowledge about the market empowers growers to make more strategic decisions ms hellams said
5136297 its quite possible that this lack of water could persist for a long time and growers may need to look at alternative business models or vineyard management strategies

5136315 were going to take our time and assess what further consequences there should be to the relationship
5136316 the facts are that the united states has to work with russia on iran on nuclear problems of proliferation on a whole raft of trade issues at a time in which the united states has a huge domestic deficit
5136317 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5136318 the whole world is looking at russia through a different set of lenses than just a week and a half or two weeks ago so there are already consequences
5136319 i think they may not appreciate the magnitude of those consequences yet the longer they take to get out and to observe the cease fire thats been declared and the arrangements that have been worked out i think the greater those consequences will be
5136320 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5136321 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way

5136377 we are witnessing a new cult in shiism whose leaders claim to be connected to the imam
5136378 is in charge of the world and we see his hand directing all the affairs of the country
5136379 some charlatans have started saying we had breakfast with the imam or had the noon prayer with him
5136380 this is a plot to fool the young generation of religious innocent and pious people
5136381 there are legal and ethical problems to buying debt in your own companies
5136382 as long as a company does not run out of money you can keep it going for quite a while like that it can help to postpone bad news for your investors

5136384 people are pretty careful about these chinese walls they must be as these are really different pools of investors and it is important the market sees a distinction there
5136385 it is genuinely unclear whether a company can own its own debt
5136386 buying alliance boots debt at 90p in the pound and holding until maturity is pretty unexciting when most funds promise 20 per cent returns for their investors
5136387 it is not really an asset class that private equity should play in most investors are really quite unhappy about seeing it happen
5136388 what we are seeing now is a dislocation of credit markets in one direction just as there was a dislocation in the other direction last year and we took advantage of it both ways
5136389 if you can invest a few hundred million dollars in names of companies where you know them really well you think the money is good and you can achieve 20 per cent returns why wouldnt you
5136390 there is considerable investor interest in putting money into debt funds at the moment
5136391 the moderation in the price increase for the singapore property market

5136402 but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave
5136403 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5136404 the afghans did not go to canada to kill the canadians rather it is the canadians who came to afghanistan to kill and torture the afghan to please the fascist regime of america
5136405 the canadian people have to realize if their sisters their brothers and their children are being killed in afghanistan it is because of the wrong policy of the government of canada and their falling under the influence of others when they sent occupation soldiers to afghanistan
5136406 events such as logar will happen again because occupied afghanistan looks at all actors that are established in the interest of america with an eye of hostility
5136407 you have to convince your government to put an end to the occupation of afghanistan so that the afghans are not killed with your hands and so that you are not killed with the hands of the afghans
5136408 this is the most difficult issue we are going to face as an agency
5136409 we are almost certainly not going to be able to defend absolutely every bit of coast it would simply be an impossible task both in financial terms and engineering terms
5136410 we will publish next year details of the work thats been done where we think the particular threats are where we think there is current defence in place we will begin to talk with communities where we think defence is not a viable option

5136414 before britney began treatment sleeping around with different men could have been the result of the manic state she was in
5136415 i am seeing the results of good psychiatry and good parenting
5136416 while she was running on the treadmill she was joking about how she doesnt have a man
5136417 how do you make out with a guy while your dad watches
5136418 theres no way that jamie would allow adnan and britney to be alone
5136419 one of the side effects seems to me lack of sexual interest
5136420 before britney began treatment sleeping around with different men could have been the result of the manic state she was in
5136421 i am seeing the results of good psychiatry and good parenting
5136422 right now britney isnt looking for a lover shes looking for a boyfriend
5136423 she really wants a guy that she can cuddle with
5136424 hows that going how are you thinking to be working with britney

5136426 come to class submit assignments on time participate and stay engaged read and follow the syllabus
5136427 it will help tremendously if the student has gone to every class
5136428 we are not high school teachers in any way shape or form
5136429 fortunately or unfortunately most professors do not think it is their job to make the classroom entertaining few will reward you for just showing up to class and sitting there lifeless but almost all will deduct points if you skip
5136430 if you do not turn in an assignment i will not ask you for it i will assume that you are content with a grade of zero for that assignment
5136431 contact me when you first have a problem if you wait until it is too late then it is too late
5136432 be prepared and participate if you dont understand something ask questions e mail your professors with concerns or set up an appointment office hours are there for a reason meet your professors and help them put a name to a face theyll never get to know you at all unless you make the effort both inside and outside the classroom
5136433 they take it personally when you express manifest disinterest in their lecture course subject discipline or person care and feeding of your professors is important talk to them it is amazing how many first year students dont get their moneys worth from their professors make them work during office hours many of them actually like students
5136434 students who have failed to live up to the requirements of the syllabus and then claim i am being unfair when i hold them to the standards set at the beginning of the class
5136435 you are back at square one just on a different board

5136444 were thankful for our partnership with the tsa that allowed us to get our first four baggage screening systems online and were glad that customers in terminal a will soon see the benefits of the inline baggage system that were seeing in the other terminals
5136445 to me that says that theres something wrong with the system not with the kids that somehow the system is failing to capture their imaginations or to transmit to them the importance of staying in school or even making them feel that there are possibilities for them within the school system
5136446 we need to be passionate about 100 percent of students graduating from high school
5136447 theyre going to be competing in a global society not just with someone down the street and if they dont have a high school education its going to be increasingly difficult
5136448 we need to start as early as their first year of high school start working with them in ninth grade making sure they have a personal graduation plan
5136449 if all they need is a half credit of government theyre not going to enroll for a full complement of classes
5136450 but they might enroll in night school or the credit recovery program
5136451 i think anytime you have one high school the kids are less likely to become lost
5136452 its hard for a young person to maintain that motivation when they fail multiple times
5136453 but if they drop out of school theres little hope of success
5136454 during the recent retail price increases by supplier companies the lack of transparency around the profitability of their supply and generation arms has led to confusion in the media and among the wider public
5136455 how can a company which has been making good profits overall be justified in increasing its retail prices even with record commodity prices
5136456 my view is that the lack of transparency as to the accounts of our major energy supply companies is potentially problematic both in terms of the reputation of the industry itself and in terms of good policy making
5136457 i would be particularly interested to hear your views on the merits of requiring vertically integrated energy companies to report the accounts of their supply and generation businesses separately
5136458 mick davis is a very clever man he has very cleverly put a bid on the table reflecting a movement of metals prices generally but we are in a different niche and it is a very good niche
5136459 there is an awful lot of doom and gloom in the stock markets and cash is king you cannot expect people not to take a pile of cash when it is on the table
5136460 we are concerned that shareholders because of the general state of the markets may be tempted to accept an offer that would deprive them of exposure to a hugely attractive business in a hugely attractive industry
5136461 platinum group metals should be disconnected from all other metals two months ago the stronger for longer price scenario based on infrastructure growth in china and india was to a certain extent exploded and metals prices fell off a cliff and platinum was no exception
5136462 but the dynamics that drive the platinum price are completely different to those that drive copper steel and iron ore
5136463 the platinum price is driven by the number of cars put on the road and the ever tightening emissions regulations in every country in the world
5136464 over the last several years i have expected mick davis to come calling i always thought that when that happened seeing as there are only three major platinum producers in the world there would be a feeding frenzy
5136465 has taken a couple of obvious would be buyers out of the picture

5136468 im not sure how we top britney opening the show but we are working on it every minute of every day
5136469 she is as nervous as hell but at the same time itching to get back in front of the same audience where she screwed up so badly last time
5136470 it is the perfect platform for her to announce to her fans and the world that the dark days are behind her and shes back on track with her life and her career she really wants to do this despite the jitters
5136471 its wonderful but like all daughters she is very manipulative and cunning so she gets what she wants a lot
5136472 she will also return to her role as air head receptionist abby in us tv sitcom how i met your mother where producers say her performances are
5136473 this is her big chance to make amends and let everyone see that she is becoming the britney of old again

5136478 we are going to help rebuild georgia into a strong georgian state
5136479 the russians will have failed in their effort to undermine georgia and we will be looking at what we can do with the states around that region as well
5136480 there is a ceasefire and russia is currently not in compliance with this ceasefire

5136494 its not really to make great photographers out of them so much as it is to give them respect for the world and for the fact that they each have their own unique vision of the world

5136496 in most cases theyve never made their own pictures before
5136497 so what gets them going is the whole idea of going out and shooting something then getting together to see their prints and talk about them a few days later

5136537 the conservative leader hopes to distract us with frisbees floral shorts and photo ops
5136538 but a serious look at his policies reveals an approach which is at best confused and at worst would be deeply damaging for our economy

5136673 the boards apparent failure to make any effort to comply with the teachings of revlon and its progeny implicates the directors good faith and thus their duty of loyalty thereby at least for the moment depriving them of the benefit of the exculpatory charter provision

5136811 somebody owns it its on a property and somebody fills it

5136815 tightly controlled departmental activities run by a small group of specially selected people
5136816 to gather information to make something happen to thwart what the opposition is trying to do to us and to learn more about what theyre trying to get from us
5136817 trying to do harm collect information about us and keep them from doing that
5136818 there have been situations where the embassy has been asked to remove the diplomat from the country in the past
5136819 the guy could finish his or her job in the u s and be allowed to go wherever theyre going
5136820 these operations are based on national or dod security requirements
5136821 we identify the possible threat we work with those who are feeling the focus of the threat and they give us some ideas about objectives at least in the operational areas what were trying to accomplish
5136822 at least we dont have to worry about anarchy anymore
5136823 if a girl gets turned on if a guy is mad at her what does that say about her
5136824 its a bit strange for us really because were kind of up on the mountain and i think its actually the people back down here at home that went through more trauma than we went through

5136826 such a decision will be followed by some logistical measures which need to be taken by both countries in order to put the agreement into effect
5136827 the ones we know about have committed criminal offenses in syria
5136828 we inquired about other people and we are still waiting for a response from syrian officials
5136829 later the cabinet will issue a separate decree for an embassy in syria
5136830 then all that remains in front of us are procedural steps which the two foreign ministries will be tasked with taking
5136831 the syrians do not need an embassy to operate in lebanon they have their intelligence as well as their allies
5136832 referring the issue of lebanese prisoners in syrian jails to committees is equivalent to killing it we all know that forming committees will not help in resolving the issue
5136833 demarcating borders in the shebaa farms area will help liberate the occupied territory whereas excluding it aims at creating pretexts for hizbullah to hold on to its arms
5136834 we are not saying that to turn our back to discussing a defense strategy for lebanon but to say that there are other important issues which need to be discussed during national dialogue sessions
5136835 we need to address economic and social issues as well as ways to implement the decisions that were taken during earlier dialogue sessions
5136836 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5136837 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5136838 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5136839 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5136840 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5136841 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5136842 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5136843 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks

5136854 there are things that youre pleased with things that you know you really have to work on
5136855 i was pleased with the number of mistakes or lack of mistakes i didnt feel like we made a lot of mistakes
5136856 i would like us to be a lot quicker in and out of the huddle weve only been here eight days
5136857 we come up to the line of scrimmage the balls ready for play but we stand there and wait for the defense to get set
5136858 thats what weve been doing every day in practice weve got to get out of that
5136859 weve got to find a back thats our goal line back
5136860 i dont think we found that tonight i think thats something we have to continue to work on
5136861 from what i saw tonight i felt like they played pretty well
5136862 nick rhodes has a lot to learn in our offense
5136863 hes not really doing the things we think hes going to do once he really learns our offense and really relaxes out there
5136864 hell make a few plays but he cant sustain anything right now
5136865 thats why you scrimmage thats why you do these things

5136868 never deliberately thought about a crack at the 22 63m world record set in 1987 when she was not quite three years old nor had she known she was the first female track and field gold medallist since long jumper yvette williams who sent her a good luck message before her event
5136869 im not very good with statistics im only 23 i wasnt even born then
5136870 get some sleep and support the rest of the track and field team before returning home she then heads to italy for an international meet before taking part in the world finals tournament in stuttgard late next month
5136871 for it to sink in that she was olympic champion she said youve worked so hard the last 10 years of your sporting caree for one moment one night and one day then its all over and down with i think it will sink in in the next few days
5136872 on the best series of throws of my life all five were 20m plus topped by a 20 56m first effort which is a new personal best new zealand and oceania record it eclipsed her previous best series in osaka last september capped by a 20 54m heave

5136874 while 85 percent of all intra sadc trade is duty free in 2008 we must acknowledge that the work is not yet complete
5136875 the remaining 15 percent of trade is still to be liberalised by 2012 and we need to ensure that all members are able jointly to meet that milestone
5136876 certainly the economic partnership deals will have a profound and even limiting impact on the process of deepening integration at the regional level
5136877 we are presently endeavouring to speak to all partygoers present and would still like to speak to anyone who may have seen this incident occur

5136889 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life
5136890 its a whole new kind of car for a whole new kind of people who really dig driving
5136891 its not how young you are its how old you arent
5136892 while the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5136893 no that is not the case the 1970 camaro is in fact the first of the second generation camaros there might be some parts interchangeability with the 69 camaro but a 1970 camaro has more in common with a 1981 camaro or a 1976 nova platform wise than it does with a 1969 camaro
5136894 the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5136895 your point seems to be that they are basically the same car and then you try to explain it away by saying that you meant that they were both f body cars

5136920 offensively theres more learning to go on its like learning a new language weve brought in a lot of new terms
5136921 there have been bumps here and there but thats to be expected trying to learn a new system
5136922 weve got the concepts down and now its time to fine tune and polish some things so we can come out full tilt and be aggressive with it

5136927 through camp were just attacking fundamentals including marching fundamentals and music skills like running scales
5136928 its not hard learning steps but if youre not good at multitasking its hard playing and doing the steps the trick is to get to know the music secondhand

5136934 well obviously the proof is going to be in the pudding
5136935 we still have to go through workouts to evaluate them but i think dana has always had the ability to bring in quality athletes i think this year was a higher number than normal but never the less her evaluation system is solid
5136936 its definitely an extremely difficult situation for them and something that is very challenging to overcome
5136937 to have to rebuild a program in such a short period of time is hard for anyone there are several challenges that come from the situation not to mention the timing of it
5136938 i could see how the broken relationships wouldnt help the situation but from an outsider looking in you cant judge because you werent there and you dont know the full story

5136964 i didnt want to acknowledge that i was in a gay relationship it had nothing my cowardice had nothing to do with daniel
5136965 i used you as a kind of patch over my real feelings i love daniel always have but that doesnt mean i had the strength to be honest with myself about the sexual part of it the love was easy but theres more between us we have a real relationship on every level i didnt want to lose that last shred of camouflage i had that last bit of safety net that i held onto that let me say to myself no im not gay i have a thing for a woman
5136966 a thing for you i think i did in some way for a while but it wasnt what you thought it was i let you think it was and i led you on i know i did and im sorry for doing that it was cowardly of me i was hiding from myself and using you to do it
5136967 i hurt you because i was too afraid to be honest with myself daniel knows that he understands
5136968 so i wanted to let you know i was hiding from myself just as much as that man
5136969 as much as he was hiding from voters thats how hard i was working at hiding from myself
5136970 probably like he had to do back then even to himself
5136971 maybe he never pretended not in private that would be a schizophrenic way to live having to lie to you
5136972 you really have always done that finished each others sentences said the same thing at the same time
5136973 ive got the extra blanket you gave me daniel ill be fine see you both in the morning

5136998 i was trying to be smart and patient and not do anything silly but then here came jr blasting around the outside on lap four
5136999 but i was watching jr even before i got by joe and i knew i had to get around joe quick because schnabel was gapping us
5137000 i was going to take a chance if i had to but i didnt
5137001 the handlebars hit me in the stomach and knocked the wind out of me and that was it
5137002 that last restart i put my head down and stayed close waiting for a big mistake or something but nothing happened
5137003 i tried to make up a little bit more time and about ran off the track with three to go and that was the end of it i gave him enough room to get away where i couldnt really put on a charge
5137004 it was hard to get back in rhythm but i just charged the outside for a couple laps and got back up to fourth regaining my rhythm is something ive been working on
5137005 i got holeshot that first third of the race and henry was banging on me he had a fast bike but i was ready to get aggressive with him

5137009 the situation was clarified after a community meeting in bokfontein near brits on saturday
5137010 the trunk of the car looked like a mobile police narcotics lab we had two bags of grass seventy five pellets of mescaline five sheets of high powered blotter acid a salt shaker half full of cocaine and a whole galaxy of multi colored uppers downers screamers laughers and also a quart of tequila a quart of rum a case of budweiser a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls not that we needed all that for the trip but once you get locked into a serious drug collection the tendency is to push it as far as you can the only thing that really worried me was the ether there is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge and i knew wed get into that rotten stuff pretty soon

5137019 evil this is one of the most pernicious statutes on our books this bill puts the final nail in the coffin of those dark days
5137020 the genesis of the law remains murky it was approved at a time when many states barred interracial marriages although supporters say theres no evidence it was racially motivated in massachusetts which began allowing interracial marriages in 1843 theres no record of the legislative debate on the bill which raced through the massachusetts legislature in three weeks and was quickly signed into law it appeared to come out of a nationwide effort to eliminate conflicts among the countrys patchwork of laws but it also came during a time of racial tension including a scandal over black heavyweight boxer jack johnsons marriage to lucille cameron who was white
5137021 they said eliminating the law would infringe on the on the rights of states to set their own marriage laws and they emphasized their commitment to the traditional definition of marriage

5137137 what these millions of rands in expenditures clearly show is that the municipality has way too much money on its hands and that taxpayers in ekurhuleni are paying too much
5137138 legally the metro is supposed to protect its employees i am concerned that the municipality could be opening itself to a counter suit from these former colleagues of mcbrides who could conceivably claim it is leaving them in the lurch
5137139 quite a few hundred thousand rand more if not a million rand
5137140 why is the metro footing the bill for that with ratepayers money surely the ekurhuleni municipality has no interest in fighting this case as it has nothing to do with them why not let mcbride fight his own legal battles

5137202 the word of the russian president needs to be upheld by his forces or people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5137203 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5137204 russia will pay a price we will look seriously with our allies and bilaterally at the consequences of this russian action for russian integration
5137205 russia has already paid a price because its strategic objective of undermining the democracy of georgia of destroying its infrastructure is not going to succeed
5137206 such provocation would only be staged by the russian side with the aim of keeping russian military units in the conflict zone
5137207 they will be dressed in russian military uniform and let go in gori where these bandits will loot and pillage the local residents
5137208 this will be filmed by television cameras and then presented to the world as an atrocity of the russian war machine

5137400 one such way is by not fully indexing tax bands and credits for inflation which effectively raises more cash as peoples incomes rise this happened the last time the exchequer finances were squeezed after the last election and may well happen again the full year cost of indexing bands and credits is around 500 million a not insignificant sum
5137401 a comprehensive programme of agency rationalisation has now been prepared for implementation there is no scope for deferring this rationalisation programme
5137402 this harsh reality now demands that resolute action be taken to correct the public finances and control public spending this means controlling public sector pay and numbers
5137403 it means imposing an immediate temporary pay freeze in the public sector while also freezing recruitment it means stopping increments and automatic promotions it means in short that the public sector must behave like the rest of the economy as it tries to adapt to the tougher times faced by all
5137404 the rate of increases seen for the last number of years cant continue there will have to be significant pay moderation and a recognition on a greater scale that employers and certain sectors need pay pauses and significant relief on any pay deal this means private companies have a right to plead inability to pay or use off setting measures for their costs like work flexibilities

5137418 since october last year there had been more than 140 service interruptions
5137419 you may well ask whats so different in 2008 and i think the answer is pretty obvious
5137420 is it a critical shortage no but it can sound very persuasive when its being talked up in a year of wage negotiations
5137421 it is a fact that civil air the air traffic control union is engaged in industrial negotiations at the moment over a wages agreement at the same time there appears to be a situation whereby youve had a number of people not turning up for work in order to create a situation which causes some difficulty

5137442 yes i would love to read you that book once again tomorrow
5137443 i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me
5137444 i have come that they may have life and that they may have it more abundantly
5137445 i am the light of the world he who follows me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life
5137446 so how does someone follow jesus and become a christian
5137447 as it is written there is none righteous no not one
5137448 f or all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
5137449 therefore just as through one man sin entered the world and death through sin and thus death spread to all men because all sinned
5137450 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life
5137451 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord
5137452 but god demonstrates his own love toward us in that while we were still sinners christ died for us
5137453 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
5137454 t hat if you confess with your mouth the lord jesus and believe in your heart that god has raised him from the dead you will be saved
5137455 for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other created thing shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord
5137456 these things i have written to you who believe in the name of the son of god that you may
5137457 there should be no slot remedy i dont see how it could be justified
5137458 we see that the 1 3 answer is obtained by following the goal of minimizing expected total inaccuracy while the 1 2 answer is obtained by following the goal of minimizing expected average inaccuracy
5137459 before i was put under anesthesia i asked myself what is probability that i will ever wake up due to heads since it would happen if and only if the coin flipped heads i knew then the odds of that were 1 2 now i have woken just like i knew i would and i still know nothing about the coin toss result the odds of heads must still be 1 2
5137460 wait i know more than that i picked a door at random and walked in if you were cloned i would have found you for sure if you werent i would have had only a 50 chance of finding you since the event that i would find you was twice as likely if the coin landed tails the probability now that the coin did actually land tails is twice that of heads given that i actually did find you that is heads has probability 1 3
5137461 no look at it from my point of view when you randomly picked a room there were only two possibilities for me either you would find me or you wouldnt since you picked at random not only are these possibilities equally likely but the event that you would find me is completely independent of the coin toss hence the conditional probability of heads given that you found me must be the same as i would have assessed it before you came 1 2
5137462 there are three equiprobable cases 1 the coin was heads and i have an option of winning 5 2 the coin was tails this is my first awakening and i have an option of losing 4 3 the coin was tails this is my first awakening and i have an option of losing 4 therefore i reject the bet
5137463 the king decided to play a game he tossed a coin if it came up heads he put the gift of five manors in an envelope and had a representative of your baron summoned to be offered the envelope if it came up tails he put two separate documents each ordering the confiscation of two manors in two separate envelopes and had two representatives of your baron simultaneously and separately summoned each to be offered an envelope
5137464 you are such a representative here is an envelope do you want it
5137465 oh well im tired ill just see her in the morning
5137466 secretly toss a coin and if it comes up heads fly to the 1 daisy field if it is tails go to the 2 daisy field i will jump out and land on a random spot i will then look around me for a daisy pick me up again five minutes later and we will repeat the experiment until i land near a daisy
5137467 you will now be taken from this court and locked in a prison cell meanwhile the trial will continue and we will hear the evidence of the witnesses if we find you not guilty you will be released from prison at 10 p m tomorrow this short sentence will be for your failure to prevent or report the crime but if we find you guilty you will be visited at 10 p m tomorrow by someone who will administer a soporific and 24 hour memory wipe this treatment will repeated until you have passed 100 nights in prison and then you will be released at 10 p m psychologists advise us that this will have a reformatory effect on you
5137468 on the first evening at 10 p m they administer a soporific and a one hour memory wipe on subsequent evenings they administer a soporific and a 25 hour memory wipe
5137469 what is the probability that the coin now shows heads
5137470 what is the probability that tomorrows coin will show heads
5137471 what is the probability that tomorrows coin will say heads
5137472 well i dont remember being wakened so it must be monday this means that the probability of the coin being heads was 1 2
5137473 well i remember being awakened yesterday so today is tuesday and the probability of the coin being heads is 0
5137474 my memorys been erased so i dont know what today is for sure but by such and such an argument the probability is 1 2
5137475 my memorys been erased so i dont know what today is for sure but by such and such an argument the probability is 1 3
5137476 she also knows that each time she wakes within the experiment she will not know what day it is and will not have gained or lost any information
5137477 if i had been told the day i would give the answer 1 3 whatever i was told here i havent been told but should that bother me
5137478 the threat of antibiotic resistance is more severe in india
5137479 with hiv and tuberculosis cases on the rise it will be a double whammy for india
5137480 though there is a need to develop next generation antibiotics with the existing ones getting resistance indian companies are yet to focus on them
5137481 primarily the whole concept of antibiotics originated with bacterial infections and the 1970s 1980s and early 1990s saw a boom in the research and development of antibiotics targeting several bacteria the disturbing rise in serious diseases and infections is currently driving the pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to focus on new leads to stay ahead of disease causing microbes capable of developing resistance

5137494 i would like to buy your 2 h p motor what will you take for it
5137495 thats kind of steep ive seen others advertised for less i can offer you 225
5137496 we did a little research before deciding on our price and we think it represents fair value thanks for coming out to see us but were going to hang onto the motor
5137497 why didnt you take the deal we might not find someone else to offer us that much and besides you didnt even ask me if i wanted to take it its my motor
5137498 do you realize how far that guy drove to get here
5137499 well he came from queens so its probably 60 or 70 miles
5137500 right and its 60 or 70 miles back home thats maybe 140 miles and 3 hours for nothing if he doesnt buy your motor do you think he is really going to drive all that way and waste 3 hours for 60 bucks
5137501 wait a minute you think he is going to come back and give us full price
5137502 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5137503 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5137504 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5137505 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5137506 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5137507 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5137508 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5137509 were here its the olympic games its time for a showdown a throwdown
5137510 i thought i was going to be able to run a little bit slower
5137511 i did what i had to do and make it through
5137512 it was targeted to a specific audience for specific reasons
5137513 we accomplished that mission and it will continue in another medium
5137514 were thrilled quite frankly it played out exactly how we hoped
5137515 you never can predict how somethings going to do but we felt that the movie is so strong we just needed to get it out there
5137516 because he isnt trying to impress anyone he speaks his position he knows the facts and presents them he isnt trying to sound like a liberal to liberals and like a conservative to conservatives etc he is who he is and thats what he says
5137517 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5137518 john mccain has dealt with hard choices and has more maturity and competence to lead this nation than obama does
5137519 we asked them we flat out asked them did you hear any of the discussion
5137520 when in denver have a slice at pizzareia sic mundo on 17th fresh mozz homemade sauce delish
5137521 you gotta dance with who you came to the dance with
5137522 he has two eyebrows there was just a little hair in between them
5137523 that is not true there was only one and it didnt go down in the middle
5137524 it was just a straight line all the way across it was kind of like a bracket on his forehead
5137525 the quest to build the incredible opinion that crushes races
5137526 richs health issues prevent him from being able to participate there is no situation which could be presented which would even remotely mitigate the physical risk posed by his participation

5137529 im sorry we dont have the batter for that at the moment
5137530 umm we dont have the cheesequake either would you like another kind
5137531 umm ya i actually would like to try your banana cream pie blizzard
5137532 i know it may seem weird but were all out of pecans at the moment also that also means we dont have pecans for the turtle waffle bowl sundae
5137533 okay then ill try the chocolate strawberry waffle bowl sunday
5137534 were also out of waffle bowls for that which means we dont have the brownie waffle bowl either
5137535 we have everything but what i just listed also the ice cream machine is not working properly tonight so if you do order ice cream it will take a while also we dont have apple sause for the kids meal and we have very few hamburger buns left so i cant say for sure that youll get a hamburger also were running out of rootbeer and getting low on some of the other drinks so you can order anything else
5137536 can i have a basket of fries and a large strawberry milkshake
5137537 that you can have but the strawberries is a little bit watery because i accidentally put water in it also we only can accept debit or credit cards at the moment because of a lack of change
5137538 oh maria this is the most unusual of all my sightings youll be appalled of all my years of seeking the paranormal
5137539 oh this has to be a sign i have that exact pattern and my cups have been disappearing from my apartment ever since i moved into this building i guess i just thought i had broken some
5137540 i do that i break dishes quite often and then throw them out and not remember but now it must be a sign thats all i can say
5137541 not really enough to use for anything i might even have a couple more cups in the cupboard to go with them
5137542 we can use them when i come over besides ill just break them
5137543 they remind me of my dear late mr harold he bought them for me in england he was always good like that bringing me home presents when his work took him away
5137544 i almost forgot and i have to tell you because youre in it
5137545 last night he visited me the strange one i mean not that hes really strange hes just so different from the others have i told you about him
5137546 hes the best of all my visitors hes so demure so sophisticated and elegant and ive never seen him in the same suit twice and what a handsome devil he is if it wasnt for what mr harold might think you know being out there and everything where he might find out about it but if it wasnt for that id like to start something with this one
5137547 he must have been a real ladies man in his day
5137548 once he even donned a black satin top hat and white gloves
5137549 well anyway i saw him again last night it must have been around one thirty when he entered the room
5137550 i had had a good night writing so i was up later than usual and had just finished working and was ready to settle in for the evening as i put away my manuscript there he was standing in the salon near the turner as if studying the brush strokes of the painting he was standing right next to me he was so clear he wore tweed trousers and a russet waistcoat with horn buttons up the front and a jade outer jacket that had a butterscotch lapel and a gorgeous emerald ascot to match his jacket he looked like he had just come in from the hunt after a minute or so he walked past me into the kitchen with his air about him as usual without taking the slightest notice of me of course
5137551 some people have argued that theyre not even aware of our presence but ive never believed that anyway i didnt immediately follow him i want all my guests to feel comfortable in my house
5137552 but after he left the room i went to the doorway and saw him walk through the big room and enter the kitchen so i made myself comfortable on the divan out in the big room and waited for him there i could hear him in the kitchen opening cupboards turning on water and such like he was making a pot of tea i was glad he felt at home
5137553 he was in there quite awhile in the kitchen i mean and i could hear him opening and closing cupboards like maybe he was looking for something then after a bit he emerged from the kitchen and went into the bathroom which leads to my bedroom i waited about five minutes thinking that hed probably gone off somewhere and that was that but just then as i was about to get up from the divan here he comes out of the bathroom hes wearing only his shirt unbuttoned and nothing more child i saw london and france and everything except his back side and i might have seen that too except his shirttail was too long
5137554 and he werent that shabby neither if you know what i mean
5137555 so he comes out of the bathroom and goes back into the kitchen and it sounds like hes pouring tea at this point i almost lost my composure and went to the kitchen for another look
5137556 after a minute or so he emerges again from the kitchen still in his shirt and heres the part where you come in
5137557 and is walking away when he pauses glances back at me again and says now i suppose i must intrude on the good nature of your young neighbor in her chambers so if you would please extend my apologies to the lovely miss maria the next time you meet her i am truly sorry for the inconvenience it would be quite agreeable if sometime you were able to arrange an introduction between us good evening madam and with that goes on to the front door opens it and leaves i could hear his foot falls on the hall a few paces as if on his way to your flat but that was it
5137558 j pensa nisso a varios anos mas depois destas ultimas semanas tem a sensa o de que j n o pode esperar muito mais tempo por que o seu destinho se aproxima a passos largos do fim e deve fazer tudo pela sua perfei o e beleza
5137559 mas evidente verdade que as circunstancias imediatas que tornavam estes choros plausiveis e reais lhe escapavam hoje e que a recorda o se torna assim inverosimil como uma caricatura
5137560 verificava com particular satisfa o que esquecera completamente os coitos e que deles era incapaz de evocar o mais breve instante
5137561 quando lhe perguntou porque estava t o taciturna descobriu que n o estava satisfeita com a maneira como tinham se amado dizia que ele tinha feito amor como um intelectual
5137562 nesses dias long nquos em que rompera com zdena a liga o tinha durado quase tres anos experimentara a sensa o vertiginosa de uma imensa liberdade e de repente tudo o que fazia tinha exito
5137563 estava apaixonado pelo seu destino e at o pr prio caminho para a ruina lhe parecia nobre e belo entendam me n o afirmei que estava apaixonado por si proprio e sim pelo seu destino s o duas coisas completamente diferentes como se a sua vida se emancipasse e tivesse de repente interesses proprios distintos dos de mirek assim que a meu ver a vida se transforma em destino o destino n o tem a inten o de mexer um dedo sequer por mirek pela sua felicidade pela sua seguran a pelo seu bom humor e pela sua saude e mirek est disposto a fazer tudo pelo seu destino pela sua grandeza transparencia beleza pelo seu estilo e pelo seu sentido inteligivel sente se responsavel pelo seu destino mas o seu destino n o se sente responsavel por ele
5137564 est o prontos a vender s pessoas um futuro em troca do passado
5137565 e se fala t o depressa e se lhe evita os olhos n o por segurar nas m os uma armadilha lan ada mas por ter as m os completamente vazias
5137566 quando ele a deixou ela s deisejou uma coisa demonstrar que a fidelidade um valor superior a todos os outros quis demostrar que ele era infiel
5137567 ah sim verdade as cartas eram terrivelmente sentimentais devia a todo custo provar a si pr prio que n o eram nem a fraqueza nem a miseria que o ligavam quela mulher e sim o amor
5137568 em tudo isto n o havia um grama de verdade hoje quando olha para tr s s v lendas e mentiras
5137569 sim olha para tr s porque hoje esqueceu o que tinha sido quando era jovem sabe que falhou por isso que queria saber de onde partiu para perceber em que ponto errou
5137570 n o foi um raciocinio ou um calculo que o conduziu at ela mas um desejo insuportavel o desejo de estender o bra o muito longe dentro do seu passado e de o esmurrar o desejo de lacerar com uma faca o quadro de sua juventude um desejo apaixonhado que n o pode dominar e continuar insatisfeito
5137571 queria carregar depressa no acelerador para escapar esta recorda o mas desta vez n o vou me deixar roubar e invoca a para que permane a por um instante
5137572 se queria apaga las das fotografias da sua vida n o era porque n o a amava mas porque a tinha amado apagou a a ela e ao amor raspou lhe a imagem at a fazer desaparecer
5137573 we at the us embassy islamabad have read with increasing concern a number of erroneous and irresponsible media reports regarding the arrest of ms aafia siddiqui
5137574 we commend the majority of pakistani journalists for their accurate and balanced reporting and overall professionalism sadly however a few have allowed rumour innuendo and grossly unsubstantiated allegations to dominate their coverage
5137575 unfortunately there are some who have an interest in simply distorting the facts in an effort to manipulate and inflame public opinion the truth is never served by sensationalism we believe your readers as fair minded and critical thinkers deserve better
5137576 therefore its high time that we set the record straight
5137577 we would encourage your readers to remain open minded but sceptical of these current and any future sensational allegations that have no basis in fact
5137578 were going to take our time and assess what further consequences there should be to the relationship
5137579 the facts are that the united states has to work with russia on iran on nuclear problems of proliferation on a whole raft of trade issues at a time in which the united states has a huge domestic deficit
5137580 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5137581 the whole world is looking at russia through a different set of lenses than just a week and a half or two weeks ago so there are already consequences
5137582 i think they may not appreciate the magnitude of those consequences yet the longer they take to get out and to observe the cease fire thats been declared and the arrangements that have been worked out i think the greater those consequences will be
5137583 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5137584 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5137585 if i would ask you how fast the american forces can leave iraq the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5137586 the same answer would be toward this situation as soon as we are assured that
5137587 residents of two separatist areas of georgia now overrun with russian troops and abandoned by georgian soldiers
5137588 over the next four years id like to try something new said phelps who set olympic records with his eight golds in a single games and his 14 career golds
5137589 im looking forward to going back to the states i just want to lay in my own bed for five minutes at least and just relax
5137590 this has been one of the greatest weeks of my life if not the greatest
5137591 ive been looking forward to this for four years and it was a fun four years he said
5137592 i have everything to remember this by i have memories and pictures i will have these medals forever and every suit every cap every pair of goggles i wore but just being part of team usa is one of the greatest memories ill take from this
5137593 i dont want this to be a once every four years sport he said
5137594 its grown a lot over the past eight years i want more people to get involved with the sport and be aware of what were doing im proud and honored to be part of helping the sport for the next generation of swimmers
5137595 he thinks sprints might be a little easier but it would be different bowman said of the adjustment phelps would have to make
5137596 i think he can sprint but he is more naturally suited to longer events it would be a change for him but i think a good one
5137597 doing all best times winning every race we accomplished everything we wanted to

5137603 we must be the party of sams club republicans not just country club republicans
5137604 but we sometimes forget he got things done as governor and president that represented compromises if today you went to someone and outlined reagans record without using his name some conservatives would want to throw him out of the party but he never wavered on core principles and he made the country a better and more conservative place

5137613 it appears that the federal government is starting to recognise that more staff are needed to get its massive job done
5137614 if government is serious about solving some of the countrys biggest challenges it needs to make sure it does not burn out its best talent
5137615 it needs to ensure that it has an adequately funded and properly resourced public service to get the job done

5137622 the problem is that the legislation puts off even beginning to pay for the pension increases until 2024 that is just as the states current large unfunded pension liability is scheduled to be retired the legislatures proposal would delay that date by three more years long after most of todays legislators are safely out of office it is irresponsible to saddle future generations of taxpayers with debt estimated at more than 3 billion to gain a political benefit today
5137623 there were varying opinions but no one opposed it i think we did a god job of lobbying truthfully
5137624 the forces of the tax and spend status quo will descend on this initiative like british troops after the original boston tea party but someone has to make an effort to stop the relentless growth of government

5137642 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5137643 this action and dual use possibilities for their ballistic missile program have been a subject of international atomic energy agency discussions and are inconsistent with their u n security council obligations
5137644 if the president and sen mccain werent so obsessed on an open ended commitment to iraq perhaps we would have paid greater attention to some of these issues
5137645 one of the questions this crisis raises is who do you want sitting across the table from vladimir putin and people like him john mccain or sen obama

5137647 didnt need to get briefed on south ossetia and georgia to make his statement about what ought to be done there
5137648 he knew immediately what ought to be done because hes been there time and again hes been to the region time and again hes been to south ossetia he knows the characters involved and so he was able to move immediately and with strength and with a definition of the issue that others had to follow
5137649 teddy roosevelt said talk softly and carry a big stick
5137650 in much of the world now were talking loudly and have no stick because what weve done is weve so focused on iraq that weve let victory escape from our grasp in afghanistan and in regions of the world like russia weve let the dangers grow more intense

5137662 weve been unable to identify one particular person who was seen briefly talking to jane rimmer
5137663 it the footage is subject to enhancement its very poor grainy footage
5137664 weve even sent it to the us space agency nasa and nasa couldnt enhance it
5137665 he is one of up to three thousand people whove either been directly investigated or nominated and that we have investigated
5137666 his conduct was suspicious down in mosman park last year in terms of trying to attempt to get a girl into his car
5137667 were going in and were going to take care of this for these guys
5137668 when i wake up in the morning i have crud in my eyes and i have like this slimy phlegm in the back of my throat
5137669 no creo que la rebaja de precios vaya a funcionar porque por nuestras experiencias anteriores
5137670 haz esto y aquello no hagas esto ni aquello as alcanzar s la felicidad
5137671 el vicio y el lujo arruinan a los linajes y a los pueblos
5137672 cuando un pueblo se arruina cae en la degeneraci n fisiol gica y se originan el vicio y el lujo esto es la necesidad de est mulos cada vez m s fuertes y m s frecuentes como la conoce todo ser agotado
5137673 con este fallo la ley de las diez horas quedaba abolida
5137674 pero como nuestros pobres t rmino t cnico para designar a los obreros quieren vivir con todo lujo su trabajo tiene que resultar naturalmente m s caro basta considerar la masa horrorosa de cosas superfluas
5137675 en francia el trabajo es una tercera parte m s barato que en inglaterra pues los pobres franceses trabajan de firme y gastan lo menos posible en comer y en vestir su alimento principal consiste en pan fruta hierbas ra ces y pescado seco muy rara vez comen carne y si el trigo est caro consumen tambi n muy poco pan
5137676 cinco libras de avena cinco libras de ma z 3 peniques de arenque 1 penique de sal 1 penique de vinagre 2 peniques de pimienta y especias en total 20 3 4 peniques permiten obtener una sopa para 64 hombres y con el precio medio del trigo podr a incluso reducirse el costo en 1 4 penique menos de 3 pfennings por cabeza

5137678 if we had no sexual harassment we would have no children
5137679 the draft regulation would define birth control as abortion it could deny access to critical family planning for women across the country
5137680 what that meant is that we knew everything that became so obvious by the summer after the invasion and the president made a decision essentially to ignore that intelligence
5137681 and the letter should as well say that saddam hussein has been actively buying yellowcake uranium from niger with the help of al qaida
5137682 highest reaches of the white house it would have to come from the very top

5137684 tomando en cuenta razones estrictamente humanitarias y porque somos respetuosos de los derechos humanos le hemos dado esa acogida y se encuentra hospitalizada en nicaragua para sacarle los charneles esquirlas y atenderla de una enfermedad que la ha atacado desde hace varios a os
5137685 porque somos respetuosos de los derechos humanos damos protecci n a las personas independientemente de qu pa s sean

5137688 the biggest problem is in the twilight zone of international jurisdictions when offenders dont come back to the uk immediately they go from one country to the next or they may stay underground in the first country where the offence has taken place we lose track of them
5137689 sends a strong message to so called sex tourists that they wont get away with targeting other countries with less strict controls than the uk
5137690 from the autumn we also intend to make registered sex offenders notify the police of any travel abroad
5137691 which sets standards to ensure that countries criminalise the sexual exploitation and abuse of children
5137692 this happened in the days of king xerxes who reigned over 127 provinces stretching from india to ethiopia at that time he ruled his empire from his throne at the fortress of susa
5137693 for this is what the lord himself said and i pass it on to you just as i received it
5137694 this is my body which is given for you do this in remembrance of me
5137695 this cup is the new covenant between god and you sealed by the shedding of my blood do this in remembrance of me as often as you drink it
5137696 so if anyone eats this bread or drinks this cup of the lord unworthily that person is guilty of sinning against the body and the blood of the lord that is why you should examine yourself before eating the bread and drinking from the cup for if you eat the bread or drink the cup unworthily not honoring the body of christ you are eating and drinking gods judgment upon yourself
5137697 o lord you know all about this do not stay silent dont abandon me now o lord wake up rise to my defense take up my case my god and my lord
5137698 the wise have wealth and luxury but fools spend whatever they get
5137699 even as the animals have died i will stand with you and my promises may what happened to these animals happen to me if i do not keep my promise
5137700 i give myself to you i give you my strength your enemies are my enemies i take your sins and weaknesses and i give you my righteousness
5137701 drink my lifes blood as i drink your lifes blood
5137702 i see you fulfilling all the terms of the covenant as i fulfill your life
5137703 take me all that i am eat of me i am yours
5137704 this cup is the new covenant ratified and established in my blood
5137705 for anyone who eats and drinks without discriminating and recognizing with due appreciation that it is christs body eats and drinks a sentence a verdict of judgment upon himself
5137706 if jesus be god and died for me then nothing less than my life is fitting for him
5137707 walk in the spirit so we do not fulfill the lusts of the flesh
5137708 i am a hebrew and i worship the lord the god of heaven who made the sea and the land
5137709 let us go with you for we have heard that god is with you
5137710 i think the mainline tradition is perhaps somewhat narrow in its ecclesiology and broadly tolerant in its theology whereas the evangelical tradition is rigidly narrow in its theology and somewhat loosey goosey in its ecclesiology
5137711 the young people i brought today do you like them
5137712 are there many young people like that in your own churches who are that passionate that in love with god that committed to the church and her mission
5137713 do you want young people like these in your churches
5137714 i think you dont have them exactly because of your broadly tolerant theology that theology helped abort a third of their peers with all due respect it assisted in a creating a sexual ethic that robbed this generation of intimacy and hope it has driven most of them out of the church
5137715 my opinion if youre really serious about seeing this kind of young people in your churches not just warming the pews but leading you might consider being less broadly tolerant
5137716 melvin i think we found your dog a woman is on the phone and believes that she has christian
5137717 my head looks good but my body feels even better ive pushed my body past its limits to get ready since i had the problems with my knee ive had to get my quads my hamstring and everything around my knee stronger to take the pressure off the tendon since we left vegas last month ive been back in the gym five days a week from 9 2
5137718 these changes to the asia pacific organization will strengthen partnership between geographies and businesses
5137719 it will leverage local expertise and thinking eliminate management layers and provide growth opportunities for our best people
5137720 to stifle our republic by force and bring the catastrophe of a war games are purely defensive
5137721 trying to keep busy so that i dont sit and dwell on it all too much
5137722 were living on a lake so thats what you pay
5137723 when we reviewed how students selected their rooms this year we found that they still prefer thompson point and the high rises over the other two areas
5137724 so the way those areas have filled up in the past compared to this year the same
5137725 i dont have a car i take the bus and i couldnt carry a bed on my back all the way up here so i still dont have one yet
5137726 we have one of the best programs for international students in the country in my opinion
5137727 we are able to show them the city and university a week before their classes start and in return they are a window to the world for all of carbondale to look through
5137728 one thing i noticed right away was people are very open
5137729 back home people dont walk up to you and say hi but here people are very friendly and it is acceptable to do that
5137730 there are a lot of different things that cause problems for students who want to study here
5137731 there is confusing paperwork visa restrictions and even little things like not being able to work off campus
5137732 i did not expect the people here to have such a thick accent sometimes i cant understand anything theyre saying
5137733 the southern illinois accent is something i will have to get used to
5137734 he is looking for some historically significant graves that are unmarked or lost
5137735 ultimately many students want to go into medicine become a vet or do something in the natural or life sciences
5137736 one thing that would be really great is interdisciplinary research i dont know how much occurs but thats the trend i see in academia and if the university as a whole wants to reach the goals of southern at 150 if were still trying i think that would be one way to help that
5137737 well it didnt pay in because you have to have a master promissory note on file
5137738 its a way for us to introduce ourselves to folks who perhaps didnt know about all the things we offer
5137739 the student alumni council does not require you to be a member but it is the membership dues that help support that organization
5137740 i went in here to get my books and stumbled upon this little get together
5137741 i like this though it gives me an opportunity to meet some new people
5137742 we really wanted to expand it this year because of the volume of people that come through here
5137743 so much comes into this office and one of my jobs is to get it out of here there are other people who should be doing it people look to the chancellor too much
5137744 theyre the ones that keep asking me you know how we deal with committees around here
5137745 i dont need another committee itll take months to set it up i dont have time
5137746 if i can get the whole staff to be talking signature programs instead of its leaking in my building we will advance beyond belief
5137747 there were a bunch of sorority girls out here and they were all fabulous and wonderful
5137748 i actually like the food but i will probably get sick of it eventually
5137749 and its kind of hard to carry the plates and cups without trays
5137750 we had probably just over a thousand students that were qualified to move in thursday
5137751 i dont have those exact numbers but id say somewhere over 600 of them chose to do so
5137752 he is looking for some historically significant graves that are unmarked or lost
5137753 ultimately many students want to go into medicine become a vet or do something in the natural or life sciences
5137754 one thing that would be really great is interdisciplinary research i dont know how much occurs but thats the trend i see in academia and if the university as a whole wants to reach the goals of southern at 150 if were still trying i think that would be one way to help that
5137755 i think an awful lot of people have come from places where there was already a ban in place
5137756 i didnt think the law was proper because i didnt see where they got off telling a person what they can do but now that its become a law i like it because i dont smell like smoke
5137757 thats one of the problems that i had with the smoking ban originally its not fair to everybody
5137758 if theyre going to take it this far they should just make cigarettes illegal and while theyre at it they might as well make alcohol illegal
5137759 i like the fact that i can walk out of the bar without smelling like an ashtray
5137760 if people want to smoke they can smoke outside but they need to try and keep the city streets clean its like one big ashtray

5137765 as a debt collector often youre trying to get someone to do something they dont want to do
5137766 people think debt collectors are making a living off others misfortune but companies are going bankrupt because people dont pay their bills
5137767 we used to do a lot of lock ups on mortgagees estates
5137768 debtors would try to refinance but couldnt so the bank would repossess the house and sell it as a mortgagee auction its one of the hardest things in the world to do literally going down there with a sheriff and a locksmith and locking them out of the house a couple of times there were parents and kids around its tragic
5137769 aussies go over there incur a debt maybe a hospital bill car accident or credit card bill and then come home a lot of people think if you leave a country you leave a debt behind
5137770 because there are scams we send copies of the invoice
5137771 were not saying to pay it all in one hit
5137772 like every kid you dont care as much about the money as you do about having a good time
5137773 personally i hate the way credit card companies prey on your naivety if you pay the minimum amount youll never get it down
5137774 he refused to meet with our agents let alone negotiate payment
5137775 within hours the debt was paid in full they thought our agents must have been connected in some way to the kidnap an unusual way of collecting a debt
5137776 people extending themselves on finance contracts for office equipment where they havent the ability to repay its the credit provider lending too much money
5137777 they tend to use their knowledge of legislation for non payment
5137778 if anyone cant catch up well send them to our hardship department and theyll find a way they might stop the interest on the account
5137779 lots of people have this thing against anyone in debt collection its seen as something evil
5137780 but its not as bad as it sounds i like working here
5137781 a lot of people leave because they cant distance the personal and business side of it
5137782 anyone with a basic education should understand that if you spend money you have to pay it back
5137783 were not as concerned about it as we initially were
5137784 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5137785 from circles around palazzo chigi nerve centre of direction of italian intelligence it is noted that the non authenticity of the video is testified from the fact that osama bin laden in it confessed that al qaeda would have been the author of the attack of the 11 september to the twin towers in new york while all of the democratic circles of america and of europe with in the forefront those of the italian centre left now know well that the disastrous attack was planned and realized by the american cia and mossad with the help of the zionist world to put under accusation the arabic countries and to persuade the western powers to intervene in iraq and afghanistan for this no word of solidarity arrived to silvio berlusconi who has been the author of the brilliant falsification neither from the quirinale nor from palazzo chigi nor from representatives of the centre left
5137786 at least calmed down we laid him down in time give me 100 000 and press them here take document to safe box for she never know
5137787 those things are photoshopped all the time you cant believe that stuff they make fake pages all the time i mean albert einstein and sartre has a myspace
5137788 i have seen many shops in my day and i know those are not shops
5137789 the warriors are history a mysterious book has been discovered it is over several hundred years old however its pages chronicle the adventures of the warriors from their very beginnings to their defeat of talpa but what does this all mean how could these things possibly have been known so long ago the mysterious woman suzunagi begins appearing to the individual warriors offering them a chance to be saved once and for all but who is she and how does she know so much about the armors
5137790 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5137791 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5137792 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis
5137793 we got to this point by a lack of enforcement the public has the right to expect the appraisal boards are taking care of that problem
5137794 do you know what that would have meant the net effect is it would have effectively shut down mortgage lending in that state
5137795 to take that action would have been an unbelievable disruption to the economy i wasnt going to do that
5137796 there has to be effective enforcement of some sort there has to be reality to it
5137797 what are you going to do if there is pressure on appraisers how are you going to penalize someone who puts that pressure on appraisers whos going to do it whos going to enforce it they need to have that or it wont work
5137798 although the evidence is still controversial i am convinced that there are sufficient data to warrant issuing an advisory to share some precautionary advice on cell phone use
5137799 the overwhelming majority of studies that have been published in scientific journals around the globe show that wireless phones do not pose a health risk
5137800 the most difficult thing to resolve is whether there is an effect with long term mobile phone use
5137801 its time for the interphone to come out its a public health issue
5137802 interphone will not be the last word it is more a progress report
5137803 observed no increase in overall risk of tumors in relation to regular mobile phone use among our japanese subjects
5137804 may be associated with random errors leading to overestimation or underestimation of true usage
5137805 it is hard for people to recall accurately their phone use over a 10 year period researchers want mobile use records but they are challenged by privacy rules
5137806 the best way to research it is prospectively off billing data
5137807 the u s had been the leading country in the research on radio frequency radiation from the 1960s to the 1990s
5137808 most labs in the u s that did research on electromagnetic fields closed down
5137809 it was 15 20 years after people began smoking that we saw concerns associated with it
5137810 we havent had long term exposure with kids there can always be surprises we cannot say with 100 certainty that it is safe it is just not clear yet
5137811 im very happy but the feeling doesnt change much because the last years i did well too
5137812 i was very happy being the number two so finally im number one for sure theres satisfaction but at the same time i dont have time to celebrate i play new york in one week
5137813 thats what i expected and hoped for many years ago when i got to number one that if ever somebody were to take it away from me he would have to play an incredible tennis schedule win the biggest tournaments dominate the game basically and then like this he can take number one

5137818 phelps image is a perfect match for companies which want to align their brand with great success
5137819 he represents health and fitness two hot buttons in america right now along with 20 other categories i can think of
5137820 phelps will reap the biggest financial reward from water since jaws
5137821 i can even see a global deal someone in the dubai naming a new swimming facility for him
5137822 his athletic feats put him in a rare position to dominate in the world of sports marketing but he will have to work hard in the next few years to make sure his presence outside the pool is as compelling as that in the pool
5137823 hes been the guy that weve got to race on these mile and a half two mile race tracks hes been decent at other race tracks too but not as stout as he is at these and theres a lot of those in the chase
5137824 we always knew that we could run this way if we just went a whole weekend without making any mistakes
5137825 we always seemed to have fast cars and good speed but maybe myself or the pit crew or somebody would make a mistake through the weekend and wed pay for it when the checkered flag fell
5137826 we were terrible at first lost a lot of track position then and had to work our way back from there its a struggle
5137827 weve been on kind of a bad spell and hoping wed get a good finish sunday
5137828 if you wait long enough by the river the bodies of your enemies will float by
5137829 isnt keeping track of how drugs are marketed for off label use even though marketing for off label use is illegal and its the fdas job to enforce that law
5137830 as a result drug makers arent being held accountable for promoting unapproved use of medicine and patient safety is diminished
5137831 he walks close to jane theres some exchange of words or there appears to be and he walks out of view
5137832 she remains on the footpath for many minutes after that there are many people milling around but the vision of this man is very grainy and its the back of this persons head and his back
5137833 master records like customers and vendors let me discard changes so why not transactions
5137834 have mercy on me o lord son of david my daughter is severely possessed by a demon
5137835 i was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of israel
5137836 it is not fair to take the childrens bread and throw it to the dogs
5137837 yes lord yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters table
5137838 o woman great is your faith be it done for you as you desire
5137839 i am going to be as radical a social reformer as mrs thatcher was an economic reformer
5137840 for reconciliation much more time was needed maybe five or six more years
5137841 now this will be even further postponed but i would like to emphasize that whatever time elapses both abkhazia and south ossetia will be an integral part of georgia
5137842 they were wanting this for what is happening right now

5137846 hmmm if i get an ipod it will explode so ill go for the cheaper zen
5137847 not have much hope that this matter will be resolved in any timely fashion that my ipod will be replaced that i will be compensated for anything
5137848 time to upgrade and give us more of your delicious money
5137849 because he isnt trying to impress anyone he speaks his position he knows the facts and presents them he isnt trying to sound like a liberal to liberals and like a conservative to conservatives etc he is who he is and thats what he says
5137850 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5137851 john mccain has dealt with hard choices and has more maturity and competence to lead this nation than obama does
5137852 we asked them we flat out asked them did you hear any of the discussion
5137853 we had a few problems with him today and he will not be able to go to this school with this kind of behavior

5137855 as rewarding as the past two and a half years have been for me professionally it is time to return to my home and husband in new jersey which i love just as you do your home state of texas
5137856 how to make friends and influence people of your own party
5137857 today there are more than three unemployed workers for every job opening
5137858 it is not compassionate to repeatedly tell those looking for work that the answer is simply growth or get a job
5137859 we must stimulate the economy to replace the 2 7 million private sector jobs lost since president bush took office and we must help those out of work through no fault of their own until jobs are available
5137860 as we enter the 1992 campaign the president who preaches racial harmony is practicing racial division
5137861 once our wives tell them they dont know where we are that should be the end of it and once they know where we are that should be the end of it
5137862 she could not explain why family members were questioned if authorities knew where the legislators were
5137863 after we did the first report we anticipated the numbers would go down
5137864 instead they were actually increasing its not just a matter of better diagnosis
5137865 we know that its a very complicated genetic disorder but its also probably true that genes are not the entire answer
5137866 its most likely a combination of genetic susceptibility and an environmental disorder
5137867 im afraid we may be moving in a more dramatic fashion that could permanently alter the media for generations to come
5137868 would be a green light to considerable and significant consolidation in the future
5137869 i guess we will be called obstructionists or maybe worse but we are making a statement
5137870 if this is going to be the only way to stop bad legislation from being rammed down our throats then so be it
5137871 dps or the rangers cant exactly come get us if we are outside of texas
5137872 this proposal would provide an enormous amount of tax relief to working families with children
5137873 anything relating to consumers is still in difficulty whether it be appliances or other things theres no sign of uptick in the economy
5137874 opposed snowes plan arguing that it would give taxpayers more money to spend but would not do enough to change corporate behavior
5137875 it is an sic a tragedy that anyones child has autism however i believe we hear a lot more about the ailment because so many of the childrens parents are white and middle or upper class
5137876 researchers found the autism rate was no different among black and white kids
5137877 notable changes in ethnicity during the 11 years of this study show a 13 6 percent drop in white persons with autism and a 6 5 percent increase in the hispanic population
5137878 all theyre wanting to do is spin this theyre just trying to play partisan politics on something that is the right and honorable thing to do
5137879 passion falling in love and standing up for justice are all perfectly compatible with aspergers syndrome
5137880 what most people with aspergers syndrome find difficult is casual chatting they cant do small talk
5137881 t he number of such workers increased by about 600 000
5137882 virtually all major news organizations agree that the flow of information to the public was blocked impeded or diminished by the policies and practices of the department of defense
5137883 i dont know if we err on the high side if the state can recover
5137884 the pilot did absolutely brilliantly to recover it when it first happened it looked like the plane would go straight down but the pilot recovered it and seemed to be in control only then did it tip and come down suddenly
5137885 hey katie thats just like when mom gave me the wrong milk and i got my leg poke
5137886 some companies wanted to buy my photos to use on their products for example a company producing coconut shelf paintings but i wondered whether coconut shelf paintings could feature the soul of my photos
5137887 i think my photos that are carved on paper in spring time book can exist for several tens of years but they will exist for thousands of years on stone
5137888 its to create this awareness that nude sunbathers are just about nude activities as opposed to weird creeps on craigslist shaggin in the bushes you know
5137889 when im running and ive got my ipod its nice to have a place to put it
5137890 if the legal profession wishes to preserve its dignity and protect the public it must begin to exercise the same self restraint now with respect to advertising over the internet that it exercises with respect to other advertising media

5137896 no no thank you just the same this really wont take but a minute
5137897 demand is strong and pricing is strong costs are going up but price increases are covering that
5137898 there is absolutely no reason why steel demand wont stay strong

5137906 our inside 50s were still lower but when we got through we were able to score and that is always what our aim was going to be

5137920 we were sitting down having lunch on the eastern side of the lake and we were looking across at the western side where the main cliffs are
5137921 we could see these cornices which are these big lips that stick out on a cliff there was one big one about two to three metres
5137922 theyre dangerous they can snap off at any time and break quite a few mountaineers have met their end like that
5137923 these two guys back country skiers turned up at the top of the crag one of them walked out onto the top of the cornice and we remarked how dangerous is that and at that moment the cornice snapped off and we saw him go down with it
5137924 his brother just skied off the top and skied down a vertical face
5137925 it was amazing to watch him scream down there they were obviously very good skiiers
5137926 luckily the guy i was with was a trainee ski patroller who knew who to call he bolted up the hill to get mobile reception
5137927 i grabbed my snow shovel and ski pole and had to ski across the lake and climb up the slope to the avalanche field
5137928 i got up there after about 10 minutes and knocked the basket off the bottom of my ski pole and starting probing probing in a pattern in the hope wed hit whatever was underneath
5137929 he was trying to swim his way to the top after an avalanche the snow turns slushy until it stops tumbling and then it packs down really hard while its still fluid you try and swim to the top
5137930 he was just operating on automatic he was obviously in shock
5137931 we werent really chatting or anything we just agreed on a plan and went as hard as we could
5137932 his brother watched him fall he was certain his brother was in a certain area there we were yelling out the guys name because he might be trapped fairly close
5137933 you push your ski poles in as hard as you can try to feel for something hard or something spongy that might give some resistance i can hardly use my right hand today
5137934 there were quite a few other people out there doing the same thing it was a brilliant blue clear sky a fantastic day to be out on the main range
5137935 theres no blame attached to anyone about what happened it was not like it was completely avoidable just one of those things

5138015 the study was based on tests of about 11 000 people in britain who were tested for hand control co ordination and clumsiness at age seven and 11 and were then followed until age 33

5138017 while it is often assumed that the cognitive impairments seen in adult obesity are a consequence of excess weight that could be putting the chicken before the egg the researchers say
5138018 the main message of cognitive therapy overall and its application in the diet world is straight forward problems losing weight are not ones fault problems simply reflect lack of skills skills that can be acquired and mastered through practice dieters who read the book or workbook learn a new cognitive or behavioral skill every day for six weeks they practice some skills just once they automatically incorporate others for their lifetime
5138019 that is exactly my goal to show how everyone can learn some critical skills the key ones are
5138020 1 how to motivate oneself the first task that dieters do is to write a list of the 15 of 20 reasons why they want to lose weight and read that list every single day
5138021 2 plan in advance and self monitor behavior a typical reason for diet failure is a strong preference for spontaneity i ask people to prepare a plan and then i teach them the skills to stick to it
5138022 3 overcome sabotaging thoughts dieters have hundreds and hundreds of thoughts that lead them to engage in unhelpful eating behavior i have dieters read cards that remind them of key points e g that it isnt worth the few moments of pleasure theyll get from eating something they hadnt planned and that theyll feel badly afterwards that they cant eat whatever they want whenever they want in whatever quantity they want and still be thinner that the scale is not supposed to go down every single day that they deserve credit for each helpful eating behavior they engage in to name just a few

5138123 worship is first and finally the service of god and needs no other justification the transformation of worshipers is not its central aim in fact we are not apt to be changed by worship if we come to it primarily to be changed for then we will be back to concentrating on ourselves the transformation of the church is a by product of the liturgy it occurs only when the church is determined foremost to simply worship god
5138124 we look to god we worship him father son and holy spirit we do this on weeks we feel the joy of the lord we do this on weeks we only feel despair we do this on weeks we feel nothing and if we do this for weeks and years slowly well find that the soul is gaining its own sort of intelligence that were apprehending things the mind and heart cannot fathom were entering into the divine presence and that divine presence is entering into us
5138125 to make 60 million plug in hybrid vehicles a year containing a small lithium ion battery would require 420 000 tonnes of lithium carbonate or six times the current global production annually but in reality youd want a decent sized battery so its more likely youd have to increase global production 10 fold and this excludes the demand for lithium in portable electronics
5138126 all of us should have an equal opportunity to develop our talent

5138128 there were just some people who were really cruel to him and they would push him down and laugh at him he didnt speak english really well and they would really make fun of him
5138129 learning does not only take place in isolation from the kids feelings being emotionally literate is as important for learning as instruction in math and reading
5138130 i used to be able to enjoy my weekends off and spend time with my children but now even those precious times have been completely burned just to earn more cash
5138131 the hospital obviously does not respect or even acknowledge the opinions of those at the bottom of the organization nor does it recognize staffs who are gifted in certain areas such as counseling caring for patients
5138132 we understand the worries our partners experienced in their lifetime and often comfort and advice one another thus the organizational structure here is more of a web where everyone cares for each other and helps each other instead of a hierarchal structure where the bottom people are often neglected by those at the top and this breed mutual mistrust
5138133 we do not want to recruit people just for the sake of maintaining the company we want people who are able to work well with each other and build strong partnerships and become part a bigger family
5138134 there are many opportunities to apply competencies like empathy such as looking after a child at home the problem lies in encouraging people to make full use of those situations which is why self initiated learning is important

5138143 reagarding sex there is a significant point where you can orientate yourself
5138144 this is quickly explained the sexual energy is generated in humans in another place as the love the flow of love runs down in the middle of the body from the solar plexus and rises at the back again the flow turns a head high over the head back and falls like a small waterfall in the solar plexus when the love affect the sexual energy
5138145 has the energy already has made some way through the body
5138146 from this reasoning you can not infer that people should constantly have sex with each other so that the flow of energy is not disturbed
5138147 if i allow and wish my partner to orgasm then love dreams and imagination combine with each other
5138148 men and women have a different rhythm often the man is the pressing part
5138149 when the pressing part belongs to a religion that prohibits masturbation sometimes there will be claims against the partners
5138150 instead we can wait for the right opportunity we can look forward to it like for a good meal we can imagine the good food
5138151 as the sea again and again surges to the shore but no wave is similar to another sexual fantasies in the quiet daydream may calmly move back and forth while approaching the shore the sexual union
5138152 sexuality is a lifelong process which goes on being middle aged and aged and there can be said much from a spiritual perspective
5138153 nothing compares to the jeti aquajet 3324 nothing comes close the output produces an unrivaled color gamut resolution quality plus it operates using water based ink
5138154 for the past three years ive been traveling the world looking at grand format products by dupont vutek scitex you name it but none of them could meet my two basic requirements 1 high photographic quality and 2 eco friendly production
5138155 ive heard about gandinnovations for several years they have a tremendously good reputation within the industry as i watched their company grow i was consistently impressed with their product range and heard only positive stories from those who used their products so i waited until the company produced a printer that captured my interest and it finally arrived nothing compares to the jeti aquajet 3324 nothing comes close the output produces an unrivaled color gamut resolution quality plus it operates using water based ink
5138156 digital printing has come a long way and is moving toward photographic quality it has changed the tradeshow exhibit landscape fabric structures are now expected splashes of color on the show floor and theyre known for allowing designer imagination to stretch much further than spandex ever could along with the technology that has made this possible graphics companies are forced to evolve we still focus on printing solutions but now offer aluminum structure lights and fabrics and constantly look toward the future this new machine from gandinnovations will allow us to become more competitive expanding mcraes event market trade show and retail business we love a challenge we continue to define industry standards in image clarity and consistency
5138157 the jeti aquajet 3324 is a perfect marriage of conventional textile printing needs and innovative digital convenience
5138158 at mcrae we dont believe that we inherited the earth from our parents we believe that we are borrowing it from our children environmental stewardship plays a roll in every aspect of our manufacturing process we recycle almost everything transfer paper fabric plastic aluminum and wooden pallets we are also committed to using environmentally friendly processes and supplies such as water based inks the jeti aquajet is so eco friendly you smell the fresh air while you work its a production workhorse

5138234 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred

5138236 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

5138246 sadly ians son tom was killed in an avalanche in the snowy mountains on sunday afternoon
5138247 the rooms will be closed for a few days but please keep in touch and think of ian
5138248 the snow and the ice slid out from underneath him
5138249 he was seen to attempt to ride the snow and stay above the surface however at some stage he has been engulfed by the large amount of snow and ice
5138250 we police were aware at that stage that a person had been engulfed by the snow and that a search had taken place by witnesses to no avail
5138251 people do need to be aware that the cornices in the high country can become unstable after a period of warmer weather
5138252 i didnt know the fellow personally but members of staff here did mr thew said
5138253 he has a young family and its devastating for the local community public service
5138254 we dont want people putting themselves at risk and that would be my concern in this situation ms nixon said today
5138255 what bothers me when we sort of see sometimes ideas like this i know the community might think that would be a good thing to do but i get concerned about people driving in motor vehicles when theyre using their mobile phones
5138256 second is you may well have that vigilante kind of thing we dont want our community to put themselves at risk
5138257 i think that people thought it would be a good idea i also understand some of the people in the community think crushing peoples cars might be a good idea as well for hoons but we dont seem to think thats appropriate
5138258 we see the potential for that footage being able to further extend what already takes place mr cameron said
5138259 in the year ahead we will continue to improve our offering with new pizza toppings better ingredients and an expanded network of stores managing director todd clayton

5138273 the conservative leader hopes to distract us with frisbees floral shorts and photo ops
5138274 but a serious look at his policies reveals an approach which is at best confused and at worst would be deeply damaging for our economy
5138275 he has tried to confine policies to vague populist promises from tax cuts to more prisons to solving family breakdown without getting drawn on delivery but dig deeper and what you see is not quite what you get
5138276 faced with calls to make the sums stack up mr cameron reverts to slogans sharing the proceeds of growth or living within our means when pressed he concedes this means sticking with labours spending plans
5138277 all the strength you need to achieve anything is within you dont wait for a light to appear at the end of the tunnel stride down there and light the bloody thing yourself
5138278 this is the most difficult issue we are going to face as an agency
5138279 we are almost certainly not going to be able to defend absolutely every bit of coast it would simply be an impossible task both in financial terms and engineering terms
5138280 we will publish next year details of the work thats been done where we think the particular threats are where we think there is current defence in place we will begin to talk with communities where we think defence is not a viable option

5138293 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5138294 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5138295 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5138296 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5138297 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5138298 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5138299 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5138300 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5138301 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5138302 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

5138309 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5138310 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5138311 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5138312 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5138313 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5138314 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5138315 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5138316 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5138317 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5138318 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5138319 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

5138332 growth in the australian and new zealand employment business has been driven by ongoing migration from print to online a growing presence in sme healthcare education and government markets improved yield and the introduction of product extensions through standout amp premium ads
5138333 more than 77 per cent of job seekers time is now spent on seek and over the past 12 months we have increased job ad volumes by more than our two closest competitors combined
5138334 with increased sales capability and new content partnerships seek learning had a strong second half and with continued leverage of the seek brand we expect this momentum to continue paul bassat said

5138340 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5138341 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5138342 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5138343 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5138344 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5138345 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5138346 actually no do you sell gift cards and do you gift wrap here
5138347 yes i have these she pointed at a display of gift cards and im sorry i dont gift wrap but if you walk down toward the other end of the mall near macys youll find a gift wrapping station where someone will be able to wrap your book for a small fee
5138348 and this is my place so please spread the word

5138353 these gels have great promise in not only regenerating bone but serving as a gene therapy delivery system
5138354 we have copied nature taking the elements and mechanisms found in plant life that have evolved over 3 billion years and recreated one of those processes in the laboratory
5138355 a manganese cluster is central to a plants ability to use water carbon dioxide and sunlight to make carbohydrates and oxygen man made mimics of this cluster were developed by professor charles dismukes some time ago and weve taken it a step further harnessing the ability of these molecules to convert water into its component elements oxygen and hydrogen
5138356 the breakthrough came when we coated a proton conductor called nafion onto an anode to form a polymer membrane just a few micrometres thick which acts as a host for the manganese clusters
5138357 normally insoluble in water when we bound the catalyst within the pores of the nafion membrane it was stabilised against decomposition and importantly water could reach the catalyst where it was oxidised on exposure to light
5138358 whilst man has been able to split water into hydrogen and oxygen for years we have been able to do the same thing for the first time using just sunlight an electrical potential of 1 2 volts and the very chemical that nature has selected for this purpose
5138359 we need to continue to learn from nature so that we can better master this process
5138360 hydrogen has long been considered the ideal clean green fuel energy rich and carbon neutral the production of hydrogen using nothing but water and sunlight offers the possibility of an abundant renewable green source of energy for the future for communities across the world
5138361 this work demonstrates that we can get a complete genome for a totally unknown organism
5138362 we extracted a complete genome from a very complex community and this is something novel
5138363 you can only use amplification when you know what youre trying to get and thats the problem
5138364 when you want to discover something unknown amplification is a very deficient technique because you keep discovering the things you already know so how can you discover the unknown
5138365 these are the bacteria that maintain the earths health some of the methane escapes in some parts of the lake you can see the bubbles but whatever doesnt escape as bubbles these bacteria do a very good job of eating it
5138366 newer evidence describes how curcumin interacts with certain proteins to generate anti cancer activity inside the body were focusing on the pathways that are most involved in cancer and trying to optimize for those properties
5138367 most of the interaction between our compound and the overactive protein comes from what are called hot spots on the proteins surface
5138368 for each spot we can design small chemical fragments and link them together to make a molecule this is what computer aided design and modeling can do
5138369 very small changes that may seem insignificant can have dramatic effects on these toxicity properties
5138370 but most of the compounds weve made have been more potent than curcumin against the cancer cells
5138371 to be able to develop a drug that in the future could have potential to treat 50 percent of these cancers would be a major contribution
5138372 the b cells have been waiting for at least 60 years if not 90 years for that flu to come around again
5138373 thats amazing because its the longest memory anyones ever demonstrated
5138374 these are some of the most potent antibodies ever isolated against a virus
5138375 the lessons we are learning about the 1918 flu tell us a lot about what may happen during a future pandemic
5138376 a neurons excitability whether it will fire hinges on this delicate equilibrium
5138377 finding statistically robust associations linked to two proteins that may be involved in regulating such ion channels and that are also thought to be targets of drugs used to clinically to treat bipolar disorder is astonishing
5138378 faced with little agreement among previous studies searching for the genomic hot spots in bipolar disorder these researchers pooled their data for maximal statistical power and unearthed surprising results
5138379 improved understanding of these abnormalities could lead to new hope for the millions of americans affected by bipolar disorder

5138382 sun can confirm that there are a couple of potential vulnerabilities outlined in gowdiaks post that are specific to j2me but those are limited to older versions of j2me
5138383 in addition these vulnerabilities would be extremely difficult to exploit because they would require device specific information that is not readily available
5138384 we saw a range of all new mainframe clients this year across the world particularly in emerging markets such as china and india
5138385 many companies are facing both space and power constraints in their data centers and are clamoring for increased data center efficiency
5138386 clients want data centers that are designed for specific processes that can help them energy efficiency
5138387 the mainframe has been completely redesigned and is as modern if not more modern than any other platform out there
5138388 trusty mainframes are alive and kicking and remain critical components of a companys it infrastructure especially for mission critical high volume transactional environments like financial services where the mainframe has proven itself to be a trusted platform for housing large amounts of data in a secure and centrally managed environment
5138389 we suspect that much of this growth is coming from existing mainframe users who are either upgrading or growing their mainframe usage
5138390 scale up the performance of sophisticated data analysis and other bi functions against larger volumes of data
5138391 bi is still a growing market pushing the software onto the mainframe helps companies to both protect and leverage their mainframe investments that is using bi to drive legacy modernization without replacement of the mainframe
5138392 classic mainframe myths still exist today mainframes have traditionally been associated with high total cost of ownership lack of advanced applications inability to support real time low latency processing poor back end data integration support shortage of mainframe skills and steep and inflexible development and maintenance curves
5138393 there are simply not enough young bright people wanting to learn mainframe skills over php java flash and other hip web 2 0 technologies
5138394 at this time you receive an interesting amount of correspondence
5138395 its an interesting question but its far too early to even consider with the ubs process in its infancy so perhaps that will come up in another six months

5138446 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5138447 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5138448 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5138449 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5138450 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5138451 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5138452 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5138453 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5138454 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca

5138457 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5138458 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5138459 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5138460 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5138461 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen

5138509 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5138510 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5138511 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5138512 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5138513 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5138514 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5138515 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5138516 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5138517 that which is hateful to you do not do to another the rest of the torah is all commentary now go study
5138518 audio panton cogito singularis listen to everything think for yourself
5138519 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5138520 that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys
5138521 a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5138522 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5138523 the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5138524 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome
5138525 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5138526 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5138527 well figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible
5138528 theres going to be punishment for that thats just part of life you cant do that
5138529 if this alleged incident proves true it goes against everything we stand for as an organization
5138530 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
5138531 i was surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous
5138532 i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing but im sure joe and j d will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think were just going to keep working on our stuff
5138533 its not something that you like to hear about and you have to just question every chassis dyno thats ever been run on every toyota
5138534 i dont know is if its a toyota problem if its a
5138535 its disappointing to hear that anybody whether its a manufacturer or a team or an individual on a team would go to any length to do that its bad for the entire garage i think
5138536 it was a good opportunity for us to go against a quality defense
5138537 i know they had some guys out but this team is a really good team and for us to come out and put a drive together to start the game was good for our confidence
5138538 i played with luke before so it was an opportunity for us to run some old plays
5138539 theyve got the whole thing tarted up and its hard to tell what theyre actually doing
5138540 we are presently endeavouring to speak to all partygoers present and would still like to speak to anyone who may have seen this incident occur
5138541 the lord will smite thee with the botch of egypt and with the emerods and with the scab and with the itch whereof thou canst not be healed
5138542 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5138543 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5138544 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5138545 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5138546 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5138547 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5138548 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5138549 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

5138601 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
5138602 disapproved of any attempts to hinder a journalist who is going about doing his job seemingly within the rules and regulations
5138603 the iocs public expression of concern is welcome but it wont have any effect without real action
5138604 the international olympic committees failure to address this problem highlights the urgent need for mechanisms to prevent further abuses

5138606 bundled away pushed to the floor and pinned down before being manhandled into the back of a police van
5138607 this is chinese territory you have to obey the rules
5138608 its up to the chinese government and the ioc to ensure media freedom during the beijing games and so far both have failed miserably
5138609 if the ioc is willing to acknowledge that this problem exists it should do all it can to prevent any more abuses the committee might also examine its own complicity in the problem

5138632 we will publish next year details of the work thats been done where we think the particular threats are where we think there is current defence in place we will begin to talk with communities where we think defence is not a viable option
5138633 the conservative leader hopes to distract us with frisbees floral shorts and photo ops

5138638 ein starkes wochenende platz drei in der qualifikation und im rennen neunter wir waren immer in den top 10 gegen rennmitte hatten wir zuviel bersteuern und haben ein paar pl tze verloren aber wir konnten uns zur ckk mpfen es war ein toller tag und nun freue ich mich auf bristol
5138639 das war nicht schlecht manchmal war das auto richtig gut am ende haben wir das auto darauf ausgelegt dass es bei den long runs schnell sein sollte ber kurze perioden hatten wir zuviel untersteuern aber alles in allem war das schon okay
5138640 wir hatten hier schon tolle resultate aber heute fanden wir an der vorderachse einfach keinen grip aber meine jungs haben nie aufgegeben und haben viele dinge ausprobiert leider hat das auto nie so reagiert wie wir dachten wir werden weiter arbeiten und wollen nun in bristol ein starkes ergebnis holen
5138641 wir haben so ziemlich alles ver ndert was m glich war kein besonders tolles ergebnis aber immerhin hatten wir zu beginn ein auto dass vielleicht gut f r platz 38 war und wir haben am ende beinahe noch ein top 20 resultat herausgeholt wir nehmen es und fahren nach bristol
5138642 ich wei nicht was ich sagen soll es war ein beinharter kampf wir haben das auto gegen ber samstag nicht gut ver ndert dann wollten wir mit zwei reifen pokern weil nur noch ein auto hinter uns war und prompt sind wir aus der f hrungsrunde gefallen
5138643 am anfang war das auto so richtig schnell ich konnte ganz vorne mithalten aber dann bekam ich immer mehr bersteuern schade denn das war am ende beinahe ein dirt track rennen wir haben nicht das gew nschte resultat geholt aber ich wei nicht woran es gelegen hat
5138644 dreiviertel der renndistanz war das auto v llig au erhalb jeglicher kontrolle am ende konnten wir dann kreise um die konkurrenz fahren wir haben viel ver ndert aber was immer wir am ende getan haben hat uns geholfen
5138645 wir befinden uns bereits im experimentiermodus und hoffen dass wir etwas lernen im vergleich zum juni rennen haben wir etwas v llig anderes probiert in der ersten h lfte waren wir dabei dann haben wir uns einen reifen aufgeschlitzt wir mussten zweimal unter gr n an die box und das hat uns zur ckgeworfen

5138662 the greatest of the design challenges is retrofitting the auto scape and turning a relatively dense but largely monotonous development field into a more varied and complex pattern

5138704 we have twelve beers on tap thats more than most taprooms or bars do a lot of people come here looking for more taste
5138705 we didnt get too many last year because we opened late in the tourism season but were getting more this year

5138725 wouldnt really change bison management operations day to day right now
5138726 without communication its difficult to put any specifics on that
5138727 re assess the appropriate geographic scope of bison management to address the alleged threat of brucellosis transmission from bison to cattle in the west boundary area
5138728 given the changed factual circumstances at horse butte and your agencies explicit authority and ability to modify ibmp practices in response to new conditions the governing federal and state law requires your agencies to prepare a supplemental environmental impacts analysis before inflicting any further adverse environmental impacts such as bison hazing capture and slaughter at horse butte
5138729 it the ibmp is an adaptive management plan and its asking them to adapt their plan which they seem reluctant to do
5138730 oh give me a home where the buffalo roam seems like its all a shooting match for the bison
5138731 were going to do bad things to bison now because the politics demands it but we promise to do good things for bison later if the politics changes

5138734 we need to build only what is necessary and build it to last
5138735 never lose sight of the power of nature to stimulate creativity wonderment and joy
5138736 falling in love with the land is the prerequisite to any adaptation
5138737 i want to get in and cuddle with it the land defines us not our architecture or politics alone
5138738 we need to be working pragmatically and poetically at the same time
5138739 knit this thing together in a way that will mitigate social monoculture
5138740 it is a question of how you protect what you value and how you do that it may mean zoning it could be providing infrastructure services only where you want to guide your growth

5138787 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5138788 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5138789 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5138790 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5138791 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5138792 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5138793 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5138794 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5138795 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n

5138798 our focus on key drivers of growth remains consistent resulting in continued strong financial results mr bassat said

5138806 manage our fish and wildlife for their traditional and deeply personal meaning to montana and their ability to attract the economic activity vital to the states prosperity
5138807 a shared sense of place is a large jigsaw puzzle in three dimensions
5138808 environmental groups have decided that farms and ranches are a better alternative land use than subdivisions for preserving open space and wildlife
5138809 charles wilkerson of the university of colorado law school noted that environmentalists are doing good work but are failing to connect with the public and engage local public opinion in the process
5138810 public agencies and businesses have a place in the dialogue
5138811 when federal and state agencies find a common goal and reach out to local business leaders for comment and support
5138812 business members tend to be connected to the tourist industry
5138813 promotes the value of investing in small business through buy local campaigns
5138814 periodicals and on line media have a role in the dialogue
5138815 encourages residents to get involved in public policy issues with reminders of opportunities for public input
5138816 during the tour participants heard the perspective of planners lawyers state water rights officials and hydrologists
5138817 each encounter with new perspectives leads to a clearer image of the total picture of sense of place and our role in it anyone can initiate the dialogue anyone can join in
5138818 the problem is environmental groups only want farms and ranches protected on their terms
5138819 urban residents need to pick up there share of the load
5138820 if people who live in urban areas wish to have places where their vision of what rural landscapes should look like are actually be brought to fruition then those urban folks should pony up and pay for the ecosystem services that will bring their dreams to reality they should also develop and improve the urban zone ecosystem services that will take another step toward cleaning up our landscapes
5138821 need to provide economic incentives to landowners for wildlife habitat
5138822 each encounter with new perspectives leads to a clearer image of the total picture of sense of place and our role in it
5138823 i wanna try that one again though missed something in there
5138824 it is junk and there is no putting it off any more
5138825 this program is unique and will be the first of its kind in wisconsin it allows inmates to give back to their community while serving their court ordered sentence it will reduce jail overcrowding and the high cost associated with incarceration
5138826 the patient must utilise the technology usefully in the correct perspective instead of dissection discussion and hair splitting
5138827 the internet which is very useful to most of us can supply ideas to the patient to gain knowledge to pose intelligent questions to the urologist and forget the actual purpose of the visit to the doctor
5138828 the urologist may have a tough time treating such patients successfully and satisfactorily
5138829 being promoted to bbc one and gaining a wider audience
5138830 the way i look at it if you get something from a doctor you dont like you find a doctor that gives you better options i found another doctor who said id live seven to 20 years so i like that doctor better
5138831 ive missed two of the three games with richmond senior since andrew has been on the varsity
5138832 he tries to be involved as much as he can without being intrusive
5138833 i aspire to be as strong as him and tough in all areas of life
5138834 i knew it drove him crazy to be as uninvolved as he was just going to the games i was happy for him that hes found a way to get a little more satisfaction feeling a part of the team
5138835 he could play linebacker for us but hes sacrificed for the team to play offensive line
5138836 hes a little undersized to be a lineman 6 1 220 but hes tough as nails
5138837 i dont know what level of football he can play but he would be a valuable member of any team because hes that kind of kid
5138838 its important for our family as much as it is for the team
5138839 its a last chance to get a ring im just ready to get going
5138840 im just a dad whos kind of sick whos looking forward to watching his son play
5138841 the doctor said well it looks like hes got all the symptoms of west nile virus
5138842 i called the state health department because i needed to know how long he was going to be sick
5138843 i was just bawling i thought he was going to die
5138844 he was diagnosed with epstein barr virus which is pretty much the same thing but you dont die from it
5138845 i dont blame him because all the doctors are doing it
5138846 id like to know how many people have been told they have west nile
5138847 this has been going on since west nile came into utah some doctors will base things on symptoms and not do tests
5138848 like any medical test they can be expensive and if people dont have insurance then sometimes the doctor will go ahead and try to help the patient
5138849 whether theyre helping or not may be something of a question
5138850 he said well it sounds like youve got west nile
5138851 it was really strange it was just contradictory to what we had heard on the news and what seemed to be happening everywhere
5138852 i ended up going to the doctor in the springtime
5138853 they found out that i was really anemic the question i have now is did i ever really have it am i immune to it am i going to get it again
5138854 people who have been told they have it are out on the lake not really worrying about it
5138855 i cant imagine how many people have been told that
5138856 maybe theres something seriously wrong that they dont know about and they say nah its west nile
5138857 we try to do education for physicians and stuff like that thats the best we can do is try to educate people of what tests to draw and those kinds of things
5138858 thats the only way to tell for sure if theres west nile
5138859 as far as i know my grandmother never saw doctor who but i am sure she would have been intrigued excited and above all flattered
5138860 welcome susan and allison welcome to nana restaurant would you like some sooooshiiiii

5138865 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5138866 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5138867 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5138868 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente

5138886 this is the most difficult issue we are going to face as an agency
5138887 we are almost certainly not going to be able to defend absolutely every bit of coast it would simply be an impossible task both in financial terms and engineering terms
5138888 we will publish next year details of the work thats been done where we think the particular threats are where we think there is current defence in place we will begin to talk with communities where we think defence is not a viable option

5138893 we believe that any abatement of these cost increases will not occur in the short term

5138895 the new company provides sunrice with a platform to leverage its branded rice food expertise in the us market and to grow its international markets through the sourcing of high quality us rice sunfoods will help sunrice grow its business and will complement the traditional australian rice supplies at a time of increasing global demand for rice and rice based foods
5138896 it is an important step in the growth of the sunrice business and the creation of sustainable value for shareholders
5138897 for a long time people kind of got use to going to the doctors and filing a claim now its like we want the whole bill upfront
5138898 we are like any other business we have to collect our money to pay our bills its far easier to collect upfront than to go after someone on the back end
5138899 its reasonable to go an eye doctor on monday and then visit other doctors on wednesday and thursday and there will be an overpayment

5138916 barack obama is the man who can lead us from the past through the present into the future
5138917 by not going backwards into the former past of ourselves
5138918 obama can lead us toward the light of the potential power that we ourselves can have and will be it is with that light that we can show the way across the vastness of the present time being and the challenges of the future that are now upon us again not to go past but toward
5138919 i support obama and his vision of non past futureness and fowardity
5138920 to think that an active candidate and leader of the republican party would come out and endorse his opponent in the middle of his own campaign its inexplicable
5138921 clearly sen mccain is taking an unusual approach in this election
5138922 and by that i mean handing the election to sen obama
5138923 in reality hed have had a better chance running in the 1904 race against william taft and william bryan than in this race against obama the 1904 crowd that was more of mccains scene
5138924 the conservative leader hopes to distract us with frisbees floral shorts and photo ops
5138925 but a serious look at his policies reveals an approach which is at best confused and at worst would be deeply damaging for our economy
5138926 he has tried to confine policies to vague populist promises from tax cuts to more prisons to solving family breakdown without getting drawn on delivery but dig deeper and what you see is not quite what you get
5138927 faced with calls to make the sums stack up mr cameron reverts to slogans sharing the proceeds of growth or living within our means when pressed he concedes this means sticking with labours spending plans
5138928 a los mismos tipos que les entregaron a ustedes a george w bush
5138929 mccain dice este es mi plan voy a taladrar aqu ahora mismo lo cual se le ocurri apenas hace dos meses cuando empez a revisar las encuestas
5138930 the pilot did absolutely brilliantly to recover it when it first happened it looked like the plane would go straight down but the pilot recovered it and seemed to be in control only then did it tip and come down suddenly
5138931 students feel secure to know if there has been an incident we can then go back and look what happened
5138932 defensively were miles ahead of where we were at the start of the year
5138933 thats come through hard work and a great attitude from the players and i guess tonight really showed that and won us the game
5138934 too many mistakes fundamental mistakes passing out of dummy half dropped balls on collision bad passing just a really very poor game skill wise
5138935 federal agencies have a responsibility to fulfill the funding of this agreement
5138936 bison have been making these movements from time immemorial its our long term vision that there will be no more hazing of bison back into the park
5138937 the most important failing of this process is that it is not public
5138938 we are being told by the promoters of this deal that this is a huge step forward rather it appears to be a very temporary bureaucratic and very expensive baby step funded in part with public dollars
5138939 why are we paying so much for something that we already own the public right of way along the county road and framing it in a temporary deal that still requires bison be needlessly and relentlessly hazed captured and slaughtered
5138940 if everything goes right over the years and all the bison behave the best case scenario will take us to step 3 of the existing ibmp where only 100 untested bison will be allowed to use the corridor and the small acreage of public land in zone 2 west of the river and south of yankee jim canyon
5138941 thus in a year like this one instead of 1 300 bison being captured by the government and sent to slaughter the government would capture 1 200 bison and dispose of them accordingly
5138942 the rtr agreement will allow bison access to thousands of acres on winter range that hasnt seen bison in many many years
5138943 we would argue that is getting to the point where we are treating bison as wildlife
5138944 the primary goal is to see bison managed like other wildlife
5138945 i think its a step in the right direction for both bison and the taxpayer it will reduce the conflict with cattle and provide bison with additional habitat its not a solution in and of itself its part of a larger solution
5138946 if this deal doesnt go through im afraid this opportunity wont come back i think the plan ibmp is vulnerable to litigation if the agencies dont respect their adaptive management obligations
5138947 essentially it appears we would pay over 3 million dollars for a corridor across lands where the public already owns an interest in a wildlife corridor conservation easement existing public lands or a public right of way in the form of the existing county road
5138948 yellowstone should have a carrying load of about 1 500 head of bison and it is approaching 5 000 head

5138951 who has been feeding you guys this kind of propaganda that you think gives you the right to go in and take another persons property this is still the united states of america where that sort of thing is not done i cant imagine who is brain washing people to the point they feel they have the right to use and take other folks property
5138952 i agree that free flowing migration is the ideal but ranchers do not allow it so hunting is the only solution to get the numbers down

5138954 i keep dreaming of orlando bloom orlando and johnny depp keep fighting over me sometimes in their pirate outfits sometimes not then i had a dream that i was riding on a motcycle w john travolta i watched wild hogs that day and tom cruise was the dog sitter and of coarse he was wearing his pink leather collar weird anyway i guess the saying a girl can always dream takes on a whole new meaning now
5138955 why does he look so weird here is it the outfit the facial hair he looks like my dad circa 1979 except for the sex ramp of course

5139037 los principios hasta ahora estudiados nos permiten describir el comportamiento de muchos colores pero a n quedan muchos sin explorar
5139038 la pregunta que nos debemos hacer ahora que entendemos como hemos logrado 12 colores diferentes de d nde provienen el resto de los colores
5139039 la respuesta es variaciones en valores tintes y sombras matiz valor e intensidad
5139040 cuando decimos que por ejemplo un objeto es rojo en realidad nos referimos a su matiz el matiz est determinado por la longitud de onda dominante
5139041 intensidad cuan brillante opaco es un matiz sta tambi n se conoce como saturaci n y o croma
5139042 los colores que vemos est n afectados por la intensidad de la luz a que se encuentran y por el matiz propio de estos en un d a brilloso podemos apreciar mas colores y contrastes mientras que en un d a brumoso el paisaje se aprecia con menos detalle baja intensidad alta intensidad

5139113 neena and i have been very close friends for decades the mehndi i applied at her wedding festivities is still bright red and wet on my palms shes courageous to have grabbed the chance to find domestic bliss at this age that evening we all celebrated the vibrancy of love and marriage in our middle age but then shared joy like this cuts across all barriers
5139114 i was part of the brides side soni neena ila and i have bonded since 1982 when we worked together in shyam benegals mandi soni is married and now neena
5139115 it was a memorable wedding after the impromptu wedding in the us i told kalpana she shouldve brought along the man she loves and undergone a wedding ceremony
5139116 i know the mehndi and sangeet ceremonies happen before the wedding i also know im past the age of such frolic and fun but what to do all my friends are young at heart and so am i they all wanted to be part of my marriage even if it was belatedly
5139117 the whole idea of announcing the project long before things had even begun to fall in place was to cash in on kishoredas 79th birthday aug 4 the fact is nothing is ready yet it would take at least a year if not more for this ambitious project to concretise
5139118 it is a daunting task to put together a biopic on a man as colourful versatile adventurous and unpredictable as kishore kumar
5139119 im currently in new york finalising locations for the film that im going to direct for karan johar so i really dont know whats going on back home
5139120 they mustve their reason for announcing the project when they did i havent started any work on it ive just heard that im doing it
5139121 the films director shoojit sircar and i have known each other for years when i was told he was helming the project i didnt hesitate
5139122 how do i telescope a life so flush with genius do i go back and forth in time a linear narrative seems impossible but one thing i wont do is official research
5139123 i dont want to harp on well known myths about kishore kumar like his eccentricity etc id rather dwell on unknown facets of the man for this id have to meet the people who knew kishore kumar intimately
5139124 i guess id first have to know the people who knew kishore kumar before i can find out about him so yes this project will take a great amount of time and i wont be rushed
5139125 well most people who saw rang de basanti felt connecting bhagat singh to a contemporary context was something theyd have never imagined i know chronicling kishore kumars life wont be easy but who said i want to take the easy way out
5139126 what i hoped for many years ago when i got to be no 1
5139127 was that if ever somebody were to take it away from me he would have to win the biggest tournaments basically dominate the game i didnt want that i would play completely bad and somebody would just pick up no 1 rafa totally deserves it
5139128 i am having an unbelievable year nowhere in my best dreams i can imagine something like what i did this year so i want to enjoy these moments no
5139129 the reason probably that i won this title is because i had such a fantastic time here enjoying a lot in the village
5139130 and i think they feel the same like me no i did some photos i did some autographs but always was a pleasure because i did them with another sport man

5139153 here at the oklahoma state school of journalism we are trying to keep up and surpass the technological advances that are used in todays media
5139154 oklahoma state is bringing itself to the front door of the journalism world with its recent additions of the sports media major and the teaching practices of the social media release
5139155 with the combination of the sports media major and the instruction of the social media release we at osu are trying to let the journalism world that we are here and ready for the future
5139156 the social media release will prepare current and future students to be ahead of the curve in the public relations world

5139162 ive got plenty of time for world records in the future
5139163 to be very honest we never expected such a response now even our leaders do not know what to do
5139164 even on the day aziz was killed our leaders were under house arrest people came in droves and dragged them out there is nothing our leaders can do now we have realized that the people wont listen to us even if we ask them to stop this there is nothing we can do except appealing to the protestors to carry on in a peaceful manner
5139165 the only thing we can do as of now is to channelize the protests and ensure that things remain peaceful and dont get out of hand
5139166 initially i thought this was another gimmick by the politicians but when i saw the response to the pampore rally i was convinced that this is a peoples movement
5139167 i realized normalcy wont return very soon to the valley now this has gone out of the hands of the politicians and the people have taken over there was no point keeping my workers here
5139168 but when i see so many people braving the security forces that killed 25 people in two days i no longer am bothered about business this time i want something to come off it
5139169 this is more important than the days when people believed in the gun and took to arms
5139170 i was one of those who believed in the gun in those days but now when i see these people on the streets i think they are more courageous and also believe in change now
5139171 these protests were totally unexpected and the most important thing is that these people are not armed they are out on the streets and raising slogans whoever is organizing this has to be appreciated for ensuring that the protestors do not resort to violence
5139172 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
5139173 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
5139174 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
5139175 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
5139176 did you know that you have a big scar on the back of your head
5139177 yes hello coworkers i would just like to say thank you to david smith for walking up to me in the restroom earlier and asking me if i knew i had a 6 inch scar on the back of my head up till this moment i had not and if not for the brave words of david smith i still might not be aware lets all give a round of applause for his great detective work and i would like to say that you should all make a point of going up to davids desk as much as possible today to thank him he might seem shy at first but keep trying in fact if you have a fear that you might have scars moles or any skin anomalies please ask david also please email all of your friends with davids email address and ask them to flood davids email inbox thank you
5139178 was made expressly to make me feel bad about myself so he could feel better about himself
5139179 yeah whatever your name is i have a fucking scar on my head because of the brain surgery i had after being taken hostage and shot by my deranged father in law do you want to see my colostomy bag too
5139180 i know i have a scar and i dont appreciate you talking about about me
5139181 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
5139182 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5139183 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5139184 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
5139185 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
5139186 extension was trying to send information to the net without my permission
5139187 i cant believe it ive dreamed all my life to be an olympic champion and here it is im absolutely happy dinara was great she had a crazy way to the finals at the olympics i wish her luck
5139188 die forscher wichtige probleme neu l sen und den menschen helfen
5139189 aber auf der anderen seite ist es auch in den naturwissenschaften so das sich zuerst einige fakten glauben muss ein naturwissenschaftliches weltbild haben muss dem ich relevanz zugestehe und erst dann meine zweifel beginnen k nnen ich muss zuerst etwas wissen glauben was ich von anderen menschen gelernt habe um daran zweifeln zu k nnen

5139193 the book promises be an accessible usable and desirable book about fashion beauty and style packed with realistic and practical advice victoria will share her personal top tips as well as anecdotes from the fashion world that extra half an inch will be the ultimate girls guide to looking and feeling the best that you can and learning a bit about fashion as you go along
5139194 i know from experience that making the very best of yourself is something any woman can do
5139195 this is rims most significant launch since the pearl in september 2006
5139196 it is taking the blackberry platform firmly into 3g territory which is pivotal because more than any other device the smart phone benefits hugely from 3g network access
5139197 no matter what rim did the iphone was going to sell out in the first weekend
5139198 they want to put a little distance between them and the iphone
5139199 they dont have a reputation where you dont want to buy the first blackberry devices quite the opposite everyone feels quite comfortable buying the first round of blackberrys and i think they want to make sure of that
5139200 because rim is so much more deeply entrenched with blackberry in the enterprise market this kind of bullet proof rock solid reputation matters a lot more to rim than it does to apple
5139201 the market is willing to cut apple a little bit of slack whereas it will not cut rim the same degree of slack simply because we expect more from enterprise focused companies than we do from consumer focused companies
5139202 i cant believe i actually won nobody expected me to win so there was no pressure
5139203 im so excited i really am i cant wait to get home
5139204 to be silver medallist im really happy it was a challenging time coming to these olympics
5139205 its about time weve been waiting for this so many great athletes have come so close and we were able to pull it off tonight
5139206 itll be alright it was just one of those days
5139207 dont say this dont act that way dont dress this way dont look like that dont use that tone of voice dont be so honest dont dont dont dont dont
5139208 how many times do i have to spell it out for you
5139209 now look at your mother for example shes never amounted to nothing unless you call living in a behavioral health all strung out on god knows what a life must i remind you that the proof is in the pudding sweetheart youll never amount to nothing because you came from nothing and youre really expected to turn out like anything
5139210 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5139211 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5139212 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5139213 she is like the ships of the merchant she brings her food from afar
5139214 saya sudah pergi ke gereja selama 30 tahun dan selama itu saya telah mendengar 3 000 khotbah tapi selama hidup saya tidak bisa mengingat satu khotbah pun jadi saya rasa saya telah memboroskan begitu banyak waktu demikian hal nya dengan para hamba tuhan tersebut telah memboroskan waktu mereka dengan khotbah khotbah itu
5139215 saya sudah menikah selama 30 tahun selama ini istri saya telah memasak 32 000 jenis masakan selama hidup saya tidak bisa mengingat satu pun jenis masakan yang dimasakan oleh istri saya tapi saya tahu bahwa masakan masakan itu telah memberi saya kekuatan yang saya perlukan untuk bekerja seandainya istri saya tidak memberikan makanan itu kepada saya maka saya sudah lama meninggal
5139216 we hit the ball well but we left a lot of guys on base
5139217 i dont know why he got shot i dont know why he went up there i just saw him drop to the ground
5139218 the greater the effort to accomplish a task the less likely the task will be accomplished successfully
5139219 if you dont grab him im going to hit ya
5139220 the defendant went back to the club to find the person who assaulted him and to do something himself i presume
5139221 the court needs to send a message to others that assault on police will not be toelrated
5139222 there was tape wrapped all the way around her head
5139223 a bit of wire made like a noose wrapped around his neck and kim snibson stood on his back and pulled it up
5139224 so many texans right now if they got 4 in their pocket theyve got to decide if theyre going to spend it on a gallon of gas or a gallon of milk
5139225 in the state house i had the good fortune of being able to work in a bipartisan way to get things done fighting for the people of the state of texas its time we had that leadership in washington d c
5139226 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5139227 this is a planning took where all things are going
5139228 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5139229 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5139230 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5139231 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5139232 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5139233 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5139234 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5139235 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5139236 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5139237 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5139238 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5139239 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5139240 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5139241 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5139242 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5139243 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5139244 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5139245 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5139246 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5139247 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5139248 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5139249 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5139250 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5139251 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5139252 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5139253 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5139254 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5139255 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5139256 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5139257 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5139258 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5139259 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5139260 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5139261 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5139262 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5139263 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5139264 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5139265 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5139266 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5139267 we dont want people putting themselves at risk and that would be my concern in this situation ms nixon said today
5139268 what bothers me when we sort of see sometimes ideas like this i know the community might think that would be a good thing to do but i get concerned about people driving in motor vehicles when theyre using their mobile phones
5139269 second is you may well have that vigilante kind of thing we dont want our community to put themselves at risk
5139270 i think that people thought it would be a good idea i also understand some of the people in the community think crushing peoples cars might be a good idea as well for hoons but we dont seem to think thats appropriate
5139271 we see the potential for that footage being able to further extend what already takes place mr cameron said
5139272 we dont want people putting themselves at risk and that would be my concern in this situation ms nixon said today
5139273 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
5139274 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5139275 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5139276 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
5139277 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5139278 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5139279 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5139280 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5139281 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5139282 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5139283 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
5139284 then i would favor a constitutional amendment until then i believe the states should make the decisions within their own states
5139285 for a moment we were just two christians worshipping there
5139286 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of a lot of the constitution
5139287 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
5139288 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
5139289 if youre just talking about income how about five million
5139290 we have to have work as a centerpiece of any social policy
5139291 i want to inspire a generation of americans to serve a cause greater than its self interest but i also believe we face enormous challenges both of national security and domestic
5139292 i had some feelings that i havent felt in 17 years
5139293 as he turned away he turned back and said i thought about it
5139294 this is one of those times where everything seemed to be clicking
5139295 wed like to have scored on the first drive all in all it was good i was ok with it
5139296 it worked out better than i thought it would not that i thought it would go badly
5139297 i thought i threw the ball well and moved around ok
5139298 very much in control of the huddle like he always is and very much in control of the game and that allowed us to be in control as an offense as a unit we felt like everything that we were going to run was going to work
5139299 he moved the team down the field and put us in a position to score
5139300 does that sound a little awkward or funny maybe a little bit believe me i feel very comfortable here the guys have been great theyve welcomed me i feel like im here for a reason as ive told the guys im here for one reason to help you win ill do whatever that takes and i hope it works out
5139301 obviously a lot of things have gone on the last few months
5139302 im not going to sit here and say i havent second guessed decisions not only this year but along the way one thing i know for sure when i stepped on the field as i did tonight i knew i made the right decision
5139303 were a team and im just one piece of this puzzle
5139304 at some point we have to go on and focus on what were trying to do as a team and not on one person
5139305 hes definitely much more relaxed than you would think he was
5139306 he has been in this offense for what a week as fast as he has been getting everything its ridiculous
5139307 o prop sito de lucas era did tico de catequese ou instru o e n o meramente informativo ao contar a hist ria da origem e expans o do cristianismo
5139308 sempre perguntar se um determinado incidente indica algo nico ou uma normativa para toda a igreja
5139309 preciso que as igrejas pentecostais acrescentem ao nosso ardente testemunho de experi ncia esfor o intelectual mais determinado a fim de expor com precis o a nossa f n o devemos nos deleitar com emo es profundas custa de reflex es superficiais
5139310 sometimes they remind me of another bunch from chicago the blues brothers they seem to think theyre on a mission from god
5139311 if thats how he runs his campaign he is going to lose id rather bet on those who voted before when he stands up and says that im gonna get 30 per cent more black voters im gonna get 30 per cent more of my people to turn out for me what is joe six pack thinking
5139312 civilizations flourish the most where the masses are passionate about their liberties
5139313 in the year ahead we will continue to improve our offering with new pizza toppings better ingredients and an expanded network of stores managing director todd clayton
5139314 i think we went the entire 90 minutes and deserved the three points
5139315 i talked with the guys about how big this game would have been and it was hopefully it can raise the guys confidence and we can not only come back after a deficit like we did last game a 4 1 win over d c united but we can also manage to build on a one nil up lead which is very difficult to manage sometimes and we did that so hopefully the guys can benefit from this
5139316 i think the win today was a collective effort but i give a lot of credit to mike magee
5139317 when i spoke to him a couple of times i expressed my honest opinion i think when he is one hundred percent healthy he has a goal in him two goals in two games and he is getting fitter and stronger and hopefully he will continue contributing that way for his own benefit and the team
5139318 hopefully i can get a few more this year and help the team in any way possible
5139319 it just came through a lack of communication from us
5139320 were in the 18 yard box we lose possession the ball is just hooked away were asleep on the halfway line and the next thing you know its in the back of the net
5139321 i would like to see the review of that play
5139322 i didnt think it was that bad probably worthy of a yellow card
5139323 they stuck to their guns and worked ever so hard and made it difficult to break them down
5139324 we should have had enough to break them down and we didnt so a little credit goes to the coach to get them organized and to his team
5139325 by proposing these considerable changes with only a short time remaining in the administrations term your office appears to be attempting to make changes in the endangered species act that the administration has been unable to achieve through legislation
5139326 indeed some of these proposals were included in legislation that failed to pass during the 109th congress
5139327 i remember when the coaches wouldn t let you drink any water until after practice was over
5139328 the coaches are much better now and know what they re doing
5139329 we watch the nutrition have you ever gotten a cramp we make sure he eats lots of bananas and drinks lots of water
5139330 i ve been trying to get him to do extra conditioning
5139331 plenty of rest plenty of sleep maybe a protein shake to keep him going
5139332 he s a lot better than i ever was but he s got a lot of work ahead of him he needs to stay out of trouble and keep his grades up he just needs to concentrate on high school and high school football now
5139333 he s pretty athletic likes the competition and likes football
5139334 it s kept him out of trouble and with good kids he hangs out with a pretty good group of friends
5139335 we have four kids so it s running all the time
5139336 camp is hard work and the start of something big
5139337 get through this and the rest is gravy a good camp builds w s
5139338 there s nothing like the band starting playing before the game to get you going
5139339 football is very fun to watch win or lose i like getting together with the other parents some of whom you only see during football season
5139340 im proud of you or keep up the good work
5139341 the big picture is that there are several dimensions in which games have effects
5139342 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could
5139343 these changes to the asia pacific organisation will strengthen partnership between geographies and businesses
5139344 what did you mean when you said that wed have no shortage of suspects i think its perfectly obvious who did this
5139345 two reasons if you want to start a holy war thats a pretty easy way to do it the balkan muslims hate the serbs and the chechens hate the russians so theres motivation right there and there have to be lots of bosnians and chechens who can speak russian and know how to fake orthodoxy
5139346 you burn an icon you infuriate the entire orthodox world and the war starts only this time all the balkan nations line up against the muslims whom nobody in the west wants to bail out since the russians wont pull your chestnuts out of the fire this time
5139347 but weve got to consider all options who else might benefit from the theft or destruction of this thing
5139348 an extreme russian nationalist some guy in moscow with a soviet flag on his wall who still calls it leningrad
5139349 its a possibility some radtrad gets wind of this and takes the opportunity to stick it to constantinople goodbye any hope of reconciliation for another thousand years
5139350 who else someone who wants to make the episcopal church look bad
5139351 is doing that quite well on its own thank you very much but its possible that some orthodox anglican would use this as a way to make 815 look as sacrilegious as it is possible to look but you get the idea weve got to keep all our options open
5139352 chris great to see you do you want to hear the particulars of how we
5139353 not so much no i want to examine the room
5139354 we dont care about such things here and i dont see where that matters even a little
5139355 i believe so his names amet mehmetovic part time janitor his family runs a bosnian restaurant on the south side
5139356 im well aware of that george nicky and i eat there all the time would he have access to this room
5139357 if you overlook the 24 karat gold st sava medal on a gold chain that hes planning to give to his serbian girlfriend the cyrillic bible and the unopened bottle of makers mark that hes planning to use to celebrate his engagement
5139358 how could i miss the wainscoting do you think im stupid
5139359 get me back to when the icon was discovered missing
5139360 get on the horn to the power company here and find out when any power fluctuations may have occurred in the last couple of weeks
5139361 dont let them see you but start taking pictures of everything
5139362 because if thats who i think it is you might have just solved this thing
5139363 and give me a diet coke better the kid not stick out right now
5139364 thats the guy names john michael an iranian anglican whos temporarily working at the diocese of washington
5139365 remember when i said you have a week you dont its going to break in three days
5139366 nope but tell everyone there to stay ready ill be in touch
5139367 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5139368 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5139369 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5139370 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5139371 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5139372 to sign any outstanding agreements as a matter of urgency to restore political stability in zimbabwe
5139373 the political conditions must be created so that this humanitarian socio economic situation in zimbabwe is addressed as a matter of urgency by an inclusive government
5139374 we need this inclusive government to drive the process of addressing those challenges
5139375 it is critical that we conclude negotiations as a matter of urgency because people are suffering
5139376 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5139377 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5139378 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5139379 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5139380 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5139381 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5139382 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5139383 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5139384 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5139385 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5139386 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5139387 new items coming and ill work on my wife to see which ones i can convince her i need it is so nice to have a place to come and shop and or visit where the feeling is more like friends than store clerks thanks for making music so easy to enjoy and obtain
5139388 the club put a contract to me last week so were just working through the finer details and hopefully that will be signed off in the next week or so
5139389 if we were doing any deal like that then we would have appointed outside advisers
5139390 you always look at acquisitions and its about how compelling the acquisition opportunity is certainly we would look at all opportunities we have done that in the past and we will continue to do so in the future
5139391 if they dont cut you youll tear tell them to cut you its only a few stitches and itll help your sex life after

5139396 how feasible is it that the majority of u s food consumption be shifted to a local mode how long would it take and would it necessarily be a good thing
5139397 our research tells us consumers have about five or six reasons for wanting local freshness and taste keeping farmland in the community and having open spaces a desire to be close to the food source and know where it comes from support of local farmers and keeping money in the community embedded in all of this is concern about food safety all this creates pretty powerful interest

5139427 russia is considering arming its baltic fleet with nuclear warheads for the first time since the cold war
5139428 according to the report under the russian plans nuclear warheads could be supplied to submarines cruisers and fighter bombers of the baltic fleet based in kaliningrad a russian enclave between poland and lithuania
5139429 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 per cent
5139430 absolutely clearly demonstrates what we had said earlier the deployment has the russian federation as its target
5139431 the sense of alarm may be greatest here in ukraine
5139432 since the orange revolution began in 2004 bringing the pro western viktor yushchenko to power after widespread protests ukraine has been a thorn in moscows side though perhaps not as sharp as the outspoken georgian president mikheil saakashvili
5139433 seen from moscow eyes the attempt of nato to take ukraine or kievan rus the historic heart of slavic russia for almost one thousand years along with russia and belarus was not only militarily a grave threat it was also culturally and economically potentially catastrophic given the distribution of industry and infrastructure between ukraine and russia dating back to the 1930s
5139434 however the proverbial straw that broke the russian camels back was the decision by washington to pursue nuclear missile defense installations in nato members poland and the czech republic
5139435 russia must adequately react to the agreement signed between washington and warsaw on us missile defense shield in polands territory
5139436 trigger for such a war is not georgia s right to annex south ossetia and abkhazia rather it is us insistence on pushing nato and its missile defense right up to russia s door

5139444 the filmmakers aesthetic choices in cinematography and structure create a visceral sense of place and an intimate portrait of a strong community unified in one common cause with a fresh perspective on a familiar story line the film doesnt give its subjects a voice as much as let them speak for themselves

5139455 sadly ians son tom was killed in an avalanche in the snowy mountains on sunday afternoon
5139456 the rooms will be closed for a few days but please keep in touch and think of ian
5139457 the snow and the ice slid out from underneath him
5139458 he was seen to attempt to ride the snow and stay above the surface however at some stage he has been engulfed by the large amount of snow and ice
5139459 we police were aware at that stage that a person had been engulfed by the snow and that a search had taken place by witnesses to no avail
5139460 people do need to be aware that the cornices in the high country can become unstable after a period of warmer weather
5139461 i didnt know the fellow personally but members of staff here did mr thew said
5139462 he has a young family and its devastating for the local community

5139472 no estoy conforme con mi paso por el cine creo que no he tenido la pel cula que quisiera

5139482 quiero mostrar que en esa poca en m xico era muy internacional el asunto
5139483 i know i speak for every american when i say to him today we are all georgians
5139484 and if you dont like it then hey fuck you
5139485 our analysis explicitly shows that the winning strategy is to bid at the last moment as the first attempt rather than incremental bidding from the start
5139486 this is the only art they get for the whole year they just eat it up
5139487 i grew up with access to just about every type of art that i wanted
5139488 it really formulated who i am today in most of what i do and who i am some kids have to travel for 50 100 miles just for the one experience
5139489 if you were to open this as a book you would turn the pages and say hey this is america
5139490 for that one time that kid gets an equal chance a chance to succeed
5139491 at what point do we lose that ability to do that
5139492 it just seemed like such an immense story i was just so enamored with doing this
5139493 so many people are surprised with how immense the mct is
5139494 its just one week out of a kids life but the thing that they get out of that is something they can take with them for the rest of their lives
5139495 everythings quiet no one plays music anymore theres really nothing to buy and nothing to do
5139496 everything has a feeling of destitution and despair and its not a happy place anymore its depressing
5139497 you took almost a hundred years worth of history of supporting families from this interaction across the border
5139498 you took that away and so what do you think those folks are doing for a living you think theyre going to let their kids starve theyre not no theyve gone back to the things that we didnt want them doing theyre making a living theyre not making it selling tacos anymore
5139499 its making criminals out of everyday people tourists and the mexicans alike
5139500 its very clear that the reason the policies differ is because the canadians are white and the mexicans are brown
5139501 everyone was always watching to see if their dad was coming out the gate
5139502 you dont find that closeness in the community where i live now

5139505 i cant believe weve already beaten the nine golds we won in athens
5139506 dont they get tea at buckingham palace when they get back to get more sandwiches in because weve got a lot more medals coming

5139508 we are hoping to get into patients within the next 12 months or so
5139509 we know at the moment in rat studies that our compound inhibited the development of fibrosis and the interesting thing in the future would be to see whether we can actually reverse fibrosis
5139510 currently we have some quite strong data showing that our compounds prevent fibrosis occurring
5139511 we have looked at it in a series of animal models that are very predictive of clinical outcomes hence the reason we are quite confident that our data is robust
5139512 a lot of the remodelling or the fibrosis that occurs in patients with heart attacks causes the heart to fail over the short term
5139513 if it was the first of its kind on the market it would be a huge step forward because there are currently no anti fibrotics on the market

5139553 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

5139555 it tightened up a little bit but im not coming out of the game because of something like that
5139556 it should be fine im not planning on missing my next start
5139557 it was a good opportunity for us to go against a quality defense
5139558 i know they had some guys out but this team is a really good team and for us to come out and put a drive together to start the game was good for our confidence
5139559 i played with luke before so it was an opportunity for us to run some old plays
5139560 he and i played together in cleveland so we have a way of connecting i kind of had an idea he was going to throw it because of the way the coverage looked we just happened to make the play

5139566 its amazing the chinese programme has gone from nothing to gold medal standard in four years

5139572 youll be in our thoughts and prayers i am very impressed by what youre doing and what youre prepared to do coming from a state that is not often hit by a hurricane im incredibly impressed
5139573 we have assumed that for the first 72 hours we should rely on no one but ourselves because thats how long it takes for help to come

5139578 shes a model for me i must learn from her
5139579 if it helps anyone else out there who is in their middle aged years and they put off something they thought they couldnt do because they were too old or maybe thought that because they have children they cant balance what they want to do and be a parent then im absolutely thrilled

5139722 they say oh no here the republicans come theyre so mean and theyre going to be doing all these things obama is a funny name and who knows what theyre going to do
5139723 gone through the clinton administration and the bush administration and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate and they have not so its not surprising then that they get bitter and they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations

5139738 dont you love the chase sometimes it doesnt work out those are the stakes but when it does work out its like having that first cigarette
5139739 oh i dont carry cigarettes around anymore i just bummed one off of cosgrove
5139740 oh i would never have an affair with another woman this is a hooker its not real

5139743 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5139744 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5139745 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5139746 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5139747 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5139748 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5139749 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5139750 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5139751 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5139752 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5139753 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5139754 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5139755 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5139756 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5139757 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5139758 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5139759 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5139760 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5139761 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5139762 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5139763 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5139764 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5139765 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5139766 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5139767 the first hitter of the game and you know i have some anxiety and some nerves but i think i got him out on two pitches and after that batter i was feeling a little better but for whatever reason i started to miss the zone a little bit more it became a struggle and i really had to battle but i think mostly i was just trying a little too hard
5139768 the count was 3 2 and i was hoping hed throw me a fastball because id swung and missed at a slider in my earlier at bat
5139769 he broke my bat and luckily i was able to get it up over jimmy rollins head i guess its better to be lucky than good
5139770 i was able to get a ball out over the plate and do something with it
5139771 i feel good about the win and helping the team win is the most important thing
5139772 i would like to have thrown fewer pitches and been able to have gone longer in the game as a starter you dont want to come out after five innings but im happy i was able to keep the game close and keep them in the game and contribute a little bit they put up some runs
5139773 that was great good stuff coming out of the pen as far as good fastballs with a lot of velocity good breaking balls from all of them it was good to see they did a nice job
5139774 in a lot of cases what you saw in the first inning is typical of what youll see from someone making their first major league start
5139775 a little bit erratic but he found his way as he moved into the next four innings i know that when youre in your first one youre pitching on a lot of emotion and a lot of adrenaline and it sort of saps you but he hung in there and it was good to see and
5139776 sorry pops i gotta go give the lady a kiss
5139777 of course im a good guy look at the size of my chin
5139778 i shant be subjagated to such treatment ive proved who i am
5139779 it would make us commissioners look bad because it happened on our watch
5139780 mccain says heres my plan im going to drill here drill now which is something he only came up with two months ago when he started looking at polling
5139781 the same old folks that brought you george w bush the same team
5139782 they say this other guy is unpatriotic or this guy likes french people thats what they said about kerry
5139783 they try to make it out like democrats arent tough enough arent macho enough its the same strategy
5139784 the good news is obviously no state is better prepared or organized to deal with whatever comes this way than the state of florida
5139785 we have assumed that for the first 72 hours we should rely on no one but ourselves because thats how long it takes for help to come
5139786 weve had a fortunate two years but for all of us who were here the memories of 2004 and 2005 are still fresh
5139787 now is the time for floridians to take the steps necessary to prepare should fays track bring her over our state this week
5139788 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5139789 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5139790 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5139791 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today

5139799 this thing they have now you can see all the earth but now you can look at the heavens
5139800 the world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page
5139801 where do you go to my lovely when youre alone in your bed tell me the thoughts that surround you i want to get inside your head
5139802 look into my face and remember just who you are
5139803 for christs love compels us because we are convinced that one died for all and therefore all died and he died for all that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again so from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view though we once regarded christ in this way we do so no longer therefore if anyone is in christ he is a new creation the old has gone the new has come
5139804 therefore since we have been justified through faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand and we rejoice in the hope of the glory of god not only so but we also rejoice in our sufferings because we know that suffering produces perseverance perseverance character and character hope and hope does not disappoint us because god has poured out his love into our hearts by the holy spirit whom he has given us you see at just the right time when we were still powerless christ died for the ungodly very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man though for a good man someone might possibly dare to die but god demonstrates his own love for us in this while we were still sinners christ died for us since we have now been justified by his blood how much more shall we be saved from gods wrath through him for if when we were gods enemies we were reconciled to him through the death of his son how much more having been reconciled shall we be saved through his life
5139805 since then you have been raised with christ set your hearts on things above where christ is seated at the right hand of god set your minds on things above not on earthly things 3 for you died and your life is now hidden with christ in god when christ who is your life appears then you also will appear with him in glory

5139810 its the most exciting thing on the horizon its the thing that when i wake up in the morning it makes me say god it would be cool if that happened this is my grand ambition
5139811 its up there i guess but i never really thought about it
5139812 i think its the sensitivity that was created by those tragedies that made us all think about what should we do what can we do to make our environment safer

5139822 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5139823 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5139824 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5139825 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5139826 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5139827 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5139828 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5139829 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5139830 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5139831 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5139832 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5139833 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5139834 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5139835 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5139836 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5139837 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5139838 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5139839 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5139840 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5139841 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5139842 can you tell if its a boy or a girl
5139843 im pleased that all of you have joined us as the partial birth abortion ban act of 2003 becomes the law of the land
5139844 for years a terrible form of violence has been directed against children who are inches from birth while the law looked the other way
5139845 we have just outlawed a procedure that is barbaric that is brutal that is offensive to our moral sensibilities
5139846 this ban is yet another instance of the federal government inappropriately interfering in the private lives of americans dangerously undermining the very foundation of a womans right to privacy
5139847 youre going to be ok ive been here before lean on your husband
5139848 there are bunches of doctors out there who could be prosecuted today under this legislation
5139849 scores of doctors who if they perform an abortion that falls under the very broad definition of the banned procedure could be prosecuted
5139850 now today i can say no but what is she going to do
5139851 now its like the stone age its like a muslim country here
5139852 this is the most backward law it is not for a civilized country
5139853 look at all of those praying people getting tortured in that death camp
5139854 if the paparazzi are going to run stuff and run every lie under the sun have somebody stand up for somebody
5139855 have me as a man who ended a relationship stand here and write some truth have me stand up for somebody and write that jennifer aniston is the smartest most sophisticated person i think ive ever met
5139856 shes one of the most lovely people ive ever met in my life and im going through something thats a very personal thing and you have to give that up
5139857 you have to give everything up because you cant have it all and it sucks
5139858 im sorry that the storys not interesting but its about time that somebody stands up for that girl and i think shes great
5139859 why are you asking me that question im being as honest as i can possibly can be
5139860 i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right i dont waste peoples time
5139861 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5139862 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5139863 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5139864 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5139865 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5139866 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5139867 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5139868 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5139869 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5139870 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5139871 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5139872 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5139873 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5139874 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5139875 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5139876 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5139877 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5139878 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5139879 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5139880 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5139881 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5139882 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5139883 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5139884 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5139885 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5139886 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5139887 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5139888 who are open to doing something on the production side
5139889 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5139890 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5139891 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5139892 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5139893 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5139894 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5139895 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5139896 this is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many
5139897 truly truly i say to you unless you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is food indeed and my blood is drink indeed
5139898 the vestiges of pagan religion in christian symbology are undeniable
5139899 nothing in christianity is original the pre christian god mithras called the son of god and the light of the world was born on december 25 died was buried in a rock tomb and then resurrected in three days by the way december 25 is also the birthday or osiris adonis and dionysus the newborn krishna was presented with gold frankincense and myrrh even christianitys weekly holy day was stolen from the pagans
5139900 i permit no woman to teach or to have authority over men she is to keep silent
5139901 at that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom
5139902 touch me not for i am not yet ascended to my father
5139903 wives submit to your husbands as to the lord for the husband is the head of the wife as christ is the head of the church his body of which he is the savior now as the church submits to christ so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything
5139904 husbands in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life so that nothing will hinder your prayers
5139905 i write to you fathers because you have known him who is from the beginning i write to you young men because you have overcome the evil one i write to you dear children because you have known the father
5139906 esto cre mucho temor y algunas personas est n aterrorizadas
5139907 al mismo tiempo existe una situaci n suelta en gasa donde la gente est usando armas e intentando robar
5139908 the partners at johnnys acknowledged from the beginning they wanted to tie up the space if it was to be vacated to ensure another burger hot dog place didnt move in next door
5139909 i dont want another store restaurant selling something similar setting up shop next door and take those evil street venders and confine them in some woebegotten corner of downtown where they cant interfere with my business
5139910 you should ride a scooter so you dont need to be directed to free parking
5139911 the garden park mixed use development project proposed for 20 acres off knapp street and leffingwell avenue ne was endorsed by the grand rapids planning commission and considered by the township board on tuesday night
5139912 when we see so many empty offices on the beltline and leonard and we see doctors offices that say for lease do we really need this on leffingwell
5139913 silver amp gold have we not rise up in the name of jesus and be healed
5139914 the historical data tell us clearly dont get too used to commodity export booms as any third world country will tell you they tend to go away pretty quickly
5139915 is that we have been able to greatly increase corn exports while also using it for ethanol only by increasing the acreage devoted to corn have we been able to do this and by squeezing down the use of corn for domestic livestock feed
5139916 we have achieved a worldwide manufacturing base and we are not going to shut down our factories overseas
5139917 but on the margin we will shift a little bit of manufacturing back to the united states
5139918 which means we are looking to set up shop there
5139919 fresh weakness in the european economic data and the easing inflation threat given the sharp fall in oil prices had the market shifting its focus to growth from inflation in recent weeks
5139920 this has helped the u s dollar not due to any strong u s macroeconomic data but more due to the incremental weakness in the other major economies
5139921 markets are sensing that global demand is weakening and that economies outside the u s are bearing the brunt of this weakness even emerging markets growth which showed remarkable resilience in the first half is at risk of falling below trend
5139922 we continue to position for the intensification of growth weakness outside the u s through the currency markets
5139923 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5139924 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5139925 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5139926 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5139927 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5139928 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5139929 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5139930 we should get grandma and grandpas playing cards and play a game of poker and drink some beer
5139931 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5139932 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5139933 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5139934 there is a system out there or network and that network is going to have to be attacked
5139935 i dont think if you got bin laden tomorrow that the threat has disappeared
5139936 have a big heart and didnt want to hurt anyone
5139937 we hit the ball well but we left a lot of guys on base
5139938 the ones to get hit in manufacturing are always the production workers
5139939 definitely the foreign workers will be hit harder than locals as locals tend to take on supervisory roles supervisory roles only gets affected by a second round of job cuts if the economic situation gets worse
5139940 at the end of the day its worth it because you retain your core skills its going to cost you a lot more if the downturn is only for a short while and you have to start up again with higher costs
5139941 we wish to strengthen our research so we can provide good feedback to our government thats a very important role we must play so that we can arrive at a win win situation
5139942 i am concerned with maddies lack of substance abuse this weekend
5139943 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5139944 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5139945 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5139946 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5139947 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5139948 a lot of blokes are still quite bitter with some justification
5139949 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5139950 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5139951 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5139952 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5139953 divine heresy would like to send our sincerest apologies to all of our south american fans
5139954 we were so happy to finally be able to come down and play some killer shows for all of you guys but the promoter casa de musica fucked up getting the necessary work visas and flights
5139955 please do not let this reflect negatively on the band and as soon as we find a new promoter we will come back down there and tear it up
5139956 a way of using language to induce and maintain trance in order to contact the hidden resources of our personality
5139957 although this book is far from being a complete description of my methodologies as they so clearly state it is a much better explanation of how i work than i myself can give i know what i do but to explain how i do it is much too difficult for me
5139958 responses and behaviors will also change reframing with language allows you to see the world in a different way and this changes the meaning reframing is the basis of jokes myths legends fairy tales and most creative ways of thinking
5139959 little research evidence supporting its usefulness as an effective counseling tool
5139960 nlp is far more complex than presumed by researchers and thus the data are not true evaluations of nlp
5139961 nlp has achieved something akin to cult status when it may be nothing more than a psychological fad
5139962 achieved popularity in the absence of data supporting their utility
5139963 neurolinguistic programming studies attempted to match eye movements and representational patterns these are appropriate tests of the validity of the proponents claims however one can only speculate what might have been learned with a wider range of outcome variables since this is a review of empirical research it may seem unfair to focus on limitations of the studies reported but at a minimum the authors could have critiqued the methodological rigor and conceptual soundness of the variables tested
5139964 found little if any evidence to support nlps assumptions or that it is effective as a strategy for social influence
5139965 were impressed with the modeling approach used to develop the nlp technique the technique was developed from careful observations of the way three master psychotherapists conducted their sessions emphasizing imitation of verbal and nonverbal behaviors druckman amp swets 1988 chapter 8 15 this then led the committee to take up the topic of expert modeling in the second phase of its work
5139966 original interest in nlp turned to disillusionment after the research and now it is rarely even mentioned in psychotherapy
5139967 at the time of its introduction nlp was heralded as a breakthrough in therapy and advertisements for training workshops videos and books began to appear in trade magazines the workshops provided certification however controlled studies shed such a poor light on the practice and those promoting the intervention made such extreme and changeable claims that researchers began to question the wisdom of researching the area further and even suggested that nlp was an untestable theory nlp is no longer as prevalent as it was in the 1970s or 1980s but is still practiced in small pockets of the human resource community the science has come and gone yet the belief still remains
5139968 nlp is a thoroughly fake title designed to give the impression of
5139969 largely untested treatments comprise a major proportion in some cases a majority of the interventions delivered by mental health professionals
5139970 improve the practice of nlp and take its rightful place as a scientifically based endeavor with its precise focus on one of the extremes of human behavior excellence and the high performers who actually do it
5139971 bandler and grinder create the beginnings of an appropriate theoretical base for the describing of human interaction they have succeeded in making linguistics into a base for theory and simultaneously into a tool for therapy
5139972 pretend it works try it and notice the results you get if you dont get the result you want try something else
5139973 nlp has a very pragmatic applied focus on what is helpful what works and how to replicate it bandler amp grinder 1990 while nlp draws on and shares common ground with mainstream cognitive psychology it has from its inception continued to develop refine and apply its own unique range of concepts models and techniques
5139974 nlp may be best thought of as a system of psychology concerned with the self development of the human being
5139975 it is concerned with the function of belief rather than its nature it is not concerned whether a belief is true or not but whether it is empowering or disempowering nlps focus on subjective experience and its view that we cannot comprehend objective reality means that it fits well as an example of postmodern thought
5139976 is a technique rather than an organized religion and is used by several different david v
5139977 the balance comes down against it being labeled as a religion
5139978 todo tipo de llamado a la violencia debe ser censurado por el pueblo de puerto rico sobre todo por las bases de los partidos que ya claramente nos han comunicado a los pol ticos que est n cansados de eso
5139979 este es el momento de presentarle soluciones viables al pa s para asegurar su progreso de manera firme y estrat gica para que los resultados se den con la mayor prontitud en eso es que est enfocado el ppd y con esa herramienta es que estamos convenciendo a los puertorrique os de cara a los pr ximos comicios
5139980 vamos a alzar la voz y donde quiera que se encuentre acevedo vil vamos a llamarle corrupto pillo y mentiroso
5139981 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5139982 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5139983 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5139984 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5139985 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5139986 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5139987 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5139988 we could not even return fire as we just tended to the wounded
5139989 maybe they knew we were coming they were so many and well positioned by the roadside
5139990 we know theres a ceasefire but we could not let them get away with this

5139997 thats what ive devoted my life to and what do you do with me put me in jail
5139998 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
