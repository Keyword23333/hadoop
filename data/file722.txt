7220000 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7220001 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7220002 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7220003 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7220004 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

7220008 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7220009 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7220010 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7220011 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables

7220017 we are constantly working to develop strategies and incentives to encourage and support regular school attendance for all days of the week
7220018 but its a regular school day and we have to keep it that way
7220019 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7220020 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7220021 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7220022 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7220023 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7220024 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7220025 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7220026 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7220027 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7220028 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7220029 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7220030 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7220031 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7220032 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7220033 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7220034 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7220035 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7220036 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7220037 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7220038 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7220039 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7220040 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7220041 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7220042 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7220043 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7220044 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7220045 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7220046 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7220047 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7220048 dia sempat mencoba melakukan pemanasan untuk game ini tapi dia masih sakit luar biasa bisa mendapatkan perunggu tim ini punya keberanian yang hebat
7220049 aku tak bisa berlari aku tak berusaha menjadi pahlawan aku bisa saja melukai tim ini
7220050 aku sangat bangga pada apa yang dilakukan teman tekan sulit kutemukan kata kata ini sangat emosional
7220051 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7220052 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7220053 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7220054 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7220055 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7220056 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7220057 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7220058 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7220059 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7220060 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7220061 daher denke ich dass er obama sehr klug ausgew hlt hat

7220064 as condoleezza rice arrived in georgia to finalise a peace deal and secure the withdrawal of russian troops from the former soviet state moscow issued the direct threat to another us ally
7220065 general novogitsyn added that russias military doctrine sanctions the use of nuclear weapons against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them george w bush speaking in washington accused russian president dmitry medvedev of bullying his neighbours and said the tactics were working against russias interests on the international stage following months of discontent over the planned siting of the us missile shield russia reacted furiously last night when washington sweetened its package with an agreement to sell a patriot defence battery to warsaw
7220066 the us secretary of state arrived in tbilisi today to secure the withdrawal of russian combat forces to ceasefire lines but russian forces maintained a stranglehold on key strategic points from the west to the east of georgia though the military appeared to have begun a staged withdrawal from the flashpoint town of gori miss rice brought with her a draft french brokered ceasefire that would require russia to withdraw its combat troops from georgia but would allow russian peacekeepers to remain in the flash point separatist region of south ossetia and temporarily patrol outside the area
7220067 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think

7220070 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7220071 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7220072 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7220073 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7220074 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7220075 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

7220079 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7220080 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7220081 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7220082 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7220083 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7220084 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7220085 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7220086 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7220087 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7220088 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7220089 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7220090 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7220091 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7220092 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7220093 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7220094 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7220095 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7220096 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7220097 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7220098 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7220099 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7220100 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7220101 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7220102 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7220103 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7220104 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

7220115 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo

7220121 at one point i wanted to be a journalist then i was at the receiving end now after playing a tv journalist in mumbai meri jaan im more sympathetic towards the medias job
7220122 i understand why they need to ask uncomfortable questions of course i still wont answer personal questions but i understand the journalist has a right to ask what he or she wants to
7220123 my job brings me into daily contact with the media and i watch the news closely recently when we had 23 bomb attacks in 24 hours i watched the full coverage theres too much of de sensitised lurid sensational coverage on tv
7220124 i play one of those hard nosed trp driven journalists i play a journalist who forgets that during those times the people being interviewed are human then i undergo a crisis and change
7220125 though were together in mumbai meri jaan we dont have scenes together i told him at the beginning of dil kabaddi to guide me if needed yes im open to advice provided its done without lecturing and it should be given after im well fed
7220126 i was surrounded by powerhouse actors like paresh rawal kay kay menon irrfan r madhavan i was the least experienced of the lot and i was apprehensive
7220127 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7220128 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii

7220133 i dont know when i will go back to tv if my films dont do well i will have to go back but right now im doing films and i hope it takes me somewhere
7220134 it is not that i dont want to go back to my tv image of wearing saris but it is too early to do all that again i have other films in hand also so tv will wait for now
7220135 what i was doing on tv was very regressive i have done nothing for my looks in the film it was all abhisheks vision it was all that he wanted me to do in the film and all thanks to the people who have worked on my styling i just had to carry the character
7220136 my characters name is sakshi and i play adityas farhans wife in the film it is very unlike what you have seen me do on tv i play a more sophisticated character who is a mature girl and very positive of course somebody who can do anything to see her husband happy
7220137 we wanted to be familiar with the things hes going to be involved in
7220138 i just wanted to meet some of the people hell be working with
7220139 it wasnt quite this grand when i was a student here eight years ago
7220140 he wants to be on his own but he also wants us to be involved with him
7220141 the people here are very willing to help they answer your questions really well
7220142 sometimes people look like they want to cry when they are paying for their groceries
7220143 every generation there are changes in peoples relationship with government
7220144 government should do more especially when youre spending tens of billions of dollars in iraq protecting the interests of millionaires
7220145 weve got to revoke the tax cuts for the wealthy
7220146 we definitely need to do something more for the economically disadvantaged weve allowed big corporations to take millions for corporate leaders while workers get nothing
7220147 during the era when bill clinton was president there was a clear re centering of the party
7220148 there is a growing understanding that government can play a positive role in investing in our country
7220149 enormous dissatisfaction with the republican party has brought out the base more
7220150 the rise of the internet and bloggers has made the party more progressive
7220151 by 1980 the average person said i dont need government anymore
7220152 the whole world changes and people feel a little bit at sea and they need help
7220153 we hope to come out of it with an action plan as to how we can help locally to alleviate some of the higher prices
7220154 and we want people to walk out of there with a whole lot of information

7220162 i didnt even know it was a tear there was a lot of pain in bangkok and i didnt know what it was i thought it was a problem related to my flat feet but after i returned to mumbai and finished with johns abraham brothers wedding reception i got an mri done it showed a tear
7220163 its a very common occurrence in the legs of active people like dancers and athletes that tear just stays theres no cure for it if you lead a routine life it doesnt bother you at all otherwise theres arthroscopy but my orthopaedic surgeons have not advised it i can walk work out dance do everything
7220164 i didnt want to inconvenience anyone during the shooting so as a precautionary measure i kept a therapist around because during a dance movement there was some swelling none of the dance steps changed dancing is a routine activity so the therapist was just a precautionary measure
7220165 its part of our job its no big deal you just have to understand your body and be careful four years back i ran with the wrong shoes it caused a knee problem i immediately corrected that i believe in long term health and when i work out i listen to my body if any part of my body gives me any pain i stop immediately and no trainer can push me

7220167 i kept the television off and didnt discuss war with the kids around if they had questions or worries i reminded them that he was going to be as safe as possible and that it was our job to pray for all the soldiers not just daddy i set up individual email accounts for each child as they got older but dad was the only one who emailed them they loved that they always got to talk to him individually whenever he called and as long as it wasnt a school night id wake them even if he called late it was worth the loss of a few minutes of sleep
7220168 consider having daddy say goodbye to the kids at home and then you and only you go with him to the airport its very tough on kids when they see mommy and daddy crying

7220185 there are handling costs associated with surfboards that we have to account for
7220186 they just think that its an extra pain on their employees that the boards take up extra space on their planes and that we make up a small percentage of its passengers
7220187 you know i just realized im going to be paying 360 to take my board along
7220188 with shootings you need to get there quick enough to get the shot of them loading him into the ambulance
7220189 unless hes dead on arrival if hes d o a youve got all the time in the world
7220190 to actually be in the middle of it all the gangs and all its just a visual feast
7220191 i swear on my life i was put on this planet to film police chases i swear on my life
7220192 if youre not living life on the edge youre not living life at all
7220193 you cant get close enough to the action for me if youre covering a fire and not getting burned or wet from the hoses youre not close enough
7220194 i remember having all this footage and not doing anything with it
7220195 i even had footage of an injured firefighter which is gold these days
7220196 ill keep doing this till i cant get out of bed in the morning
7220197 the kids will be strapped down in the back seat
7220198 we know people are going to drive we want them in their cars for less time
7220199 i believe in local control i come from a city council
7220200 but traffic congestion doesnt all of a sudden go from bad to good when you cross any particular city or county border and air quality and climate challenges dont respect artificial boundaries
7220201 most people dont want to live in dense urban cores most people want a little elbow room they want a yard for their children to play in
7220202 they want a little grass a little garden a little breathing room they can call their own and who the hell are you to tell people they cant
7220203 its either going to be some regulation restricting your behavior or some huge tax and neither of those is politically popular
7220204 so theres been a big debate about whether we can do this all with carrots
7220205 ive spent most of my 30 year career fighting regional planning and regional government
7220206 but what you are seeing here is a pretty thoughtful approach there are incentives for in fill development and building along transportation corridors and in the end it doesnt prevent development in suburban areas it just says there are standards and it has to be done well
7220207 weve gone from being characterized as environmental terrorists to being embraced this is like falling down a rabbit hole i feel like alice in wonderland
7220208 its been unbelievable to me that this has happened but this isnt my victory i just sat on guard
7220209 we hope to duplicate the things we do well one county away
7220210 the intent is to operate with a high standard of environmental stewardship
7220211 having a healthy well stocked forest will be a good investment over the long term

7220266 on friday i wasnt hopeful at all that we could play the game in tbilisi
7220267 i was 95 per cent certain that the game would be played at a neutral ground
7220268 but it appears now that the russian troops are withdrawing as they promised and we are far more confident that we can put this game on safely in tbilisi
7220269 we are talking with our government to get assurances on security and the safety of visiting fans and players we will know for sure in the next couple of days
7220270 there will be 50 000 passionate fans there and it would be a very difficult game for ireland but we will make sure there is no danger to any irish fans or players

7220311 once construction begins we estimate a two year completion time
7220312 im thrilled that my son will have the opportunity to attend this school which really looks promising when i graduated from the tindle oglesby private school i was really clueless about the real world this middle east e gaming development school looks much different it is the real world and promises to teach our kids how to be productive citizens no matter what career path they may follow
7220313 this aspect of our curriculum will really prepare students for the real world
7220314 and we believe it will help them gain meaningful employment after graduation

7220317 weve worked hard for almost five years now planning organizing and developing what we think will be the nations best middle east e gaming development learning center the next obvious step was to build it and get students through the doors which will not be any trouble whatsoever
7220318 it will be the best in the nation and will prepare all yukiko schmahl county youth for the challenges of tomorrow

7220330 expectations for shopping and paying online have evolved since ebay was founded people want consistent secure and fast transactions offline payment methods are no longer suitable for online transactions this opinion is shared by law enforcement and the financial services industry the vast majority of ecommerce shoppers including ebay buyers now use online payment methods on ebay com over 90 of transactions are paid with online payment methods and the use of offline paper methods has declined by 40 over the last 3 years today items paid with check or money order are 80 more likely to result in an item not received inr than those paid with credit card or paypal also buyers who pay with check or money order are 50 more likely to leave negative feedback than those who pay with electronic methods so starting in late october 2008 we are moving to 100 electronic payments credit cards propay or paypal

7220367 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7220368 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7220369 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7220370 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7220371 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7220372 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7220373 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7220374 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7220375 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7220376 it is cautious to assume a significant proportion will fail

7220378 im not sure we ought to be the primary source of residential mental health services in the state
7220379 its not like they had a straight path to prison
7220380 they didnt have other resources and once youre in the criminal justice system its difficult to get out
7220381 the inmates have thrown urine out there until they have soaked tile right up off the floor
7220382 we just could not get tile to stick to the floor there
7220383 ive been working on my behavior and now theyre going to let me back out into population
7220384 over time because of changes at the state hospital and other places we find were keeping them longer and longer
7220385 you can walk back and forth in your cell two or three hours a day
7220386 all the time youre trying to keep your calm and cool so you can do better things
7220387 they take you over to the clinic and put you in a strip cell where you just get your boxers a mattress and a security blanket
7220388 you can conceivably make their mental illness worse by isolating them too much
7220389 he may have little choice but to go off his medication
7220390 but we almost never get them back to the same level of functioning that they were on that first release
7220391 we struggle with making sure that the men and women who are leaving our facility get a smooth transition and continuity of care particularly medication maintenance once theyre released
7220392 sometimes they take them to jail because they dont know where else to take them
7220393 they will approach consumers of mental health not in an adversarial role but in a way which says they want to help them get the treatment they need
7220394 we need better housing we need more mental health beds you cant solve this by building a bigger jail

7220398 what weve done is socialized insurance and its not working

7220400 were hoping a good candidate and a good campaign will lead us to a victory

7220417 studies have shown that 50 of workers in the costa rica flower industry have symptoms of pesticide poisoning areas surrounding flower farms there have higher miscarriage and birth defect rates than do other areas
7220418 divert enough water to produce over 52 million tonnes of flowers
7220419 it is difficult to comment on the value of any potential claim against transnet should it not be able to honour its contractual obligations
7220420 however it is most unlikely that any claim against transnet would succeed if it is prevented by law from honouring its obligations in respect of reclamation
7220421 without going into the gory details we are mortgaged up to the gills
7220422 we have invested nearly 30 million over the past year in price cuts
7220423 georgia has stood for freedom around the world now the world must stand for freedom in georgia
7220424 which eventually attain policy dynamics of their own and become a burden on the government and or confuse the policy making process
7220425 georgia is a semi democracy we have traded one kind of semi democratic system for another there is a real need to understand that what happened is another one party government emerged
7220426 uncertain democracy u s foreign policy and georgias rose revolution
7220427 if we declare victory prematurely as i think the bush administration has done it is not good for democracy generally and not good for georgia in particular
7220428 relative to its self image and the way it is portrayed in the united states georgia is not a pristine democracy
7220429 has not even come close to finishing its democratic evolution it still has a long way to go on many fronts and we are committed to helping georgia move even deeper in its democratic evolution
7220430 i was excited to go to georgia i thought it had real prospects
7220431 but i couldnt have been more disappointed in terms of being able to accomplish anything
7220432 georgia has made enormous strides in governmental reform but must improve the effectiveness of key institutions strengthen political pluralism and increase public participation to truly consolidate its democratic gains
7220433 de h vader verkiest fanta zelf weet ik niet precies waarom misschien is het omdat fanta oorspronkelijk in duitsland werd uitgevonden hij drinkt op zijn minst drie of vier blikjes per dag en altijd bij het avondmaal
7220434 keulen lag naast de deur iedereen kon er bij wijze van spreken op eigen gelegenheid naar toe tickets naar australi zijn veel duurder
7220435 als je bedenkt dat er vanuit frankrijk 4000 jongeren naar sydney gaan terwijl dat land vele malen groter is dan nederland dan doen wij het procentueel gezien zo slecht nog niet
7220436 de onderzochte jongeren getuigen van een groter persoonlijk engagement voor hun godsdienst terwijl dat vroeger eerder uitwendig was en vaak behoorde tot de gezinscultuur
7220437 de vraag blijft of die impact zich ook op zeer langer termijn doorzet
7220438 we dont even bother to hope anymore that somebody will come to protect us
7220439 they dont come out and say they want us off the land but they are forcing us off
7220440 they put a kalashnikov to my chest and said do you have money gold or a car
7220441 i started crying and one of them said dont worry we wont do anything wrong to you
7220442 the militias are still coming theyre still driving through and robbing us
7220443 when cars come through were just hiding there is nobody to protect us and were very scared
7220444 the soldiers dont say anything to us they only enter in houses and ask for food and drink
7220445 who has anything to give them but what they can find they take
7220446 they were entering into yards and making inquiries and if they found them they shot them
7220447 it was horrible of course but i told myself i had to do it
7220448 shopping on base is better for those with smaller children than with teenagers the military exchange has most of what people need if they re not too particular with what they buy
7220449 for the kids that are going to grow a few inches in a year shopping in the u s or online provides a better selection for size and for what they want to wear it s also cheaper than in the exchange we spent 9 on a pair of shorts in the states and saw the same item in the exchange for 40
7220450 they have good stuff at the exchange but not a lot of selection everyone here walks around looking like twins
7220451 it s easier to find the sizes we need and the styles we want online
7220452 i don t get that excited about it anymore that stopped long ago
7220453 it s really not that big a deal for me i just get what i need when i need it i don t plan any big shopping trips i brought things when i was in the states throughout the summer
7220454 well well well doesnt that remind you of someone in our college days its payback time
7220455 quando mi ero qualificata avevo pianto di gioia non pensavo di potercela fare il segreto saper trasformare le cose negative in energia positiva e questo non un messaggio solo per i disabili vale per tutti
7220456 impara il segreto di chi sa trasformare le cose negative in energia positiva
7220457 e importante lavorare assaporando il gusto di ci che fai il sacrificio passa inosservato se fai le cose con slancio ed entusiasmo
7220458 on friday i wasnt hopeful at all that we could play the game in tbilisi
7220459 i was 95 per cent certain that the game would be played at a neutral ground
7220460 but it appears now that the russian troops are withdrawing as they promised and we are far more confident that we can put this game on safely in tbilisi
7220461 we are talking with our government to get assurances on security and the safety of visiting fans and players we will know for sure in the next couple of days
7220462 there will be 50 000 passionate fans there and it would be a very difficult game for ireland but we will make sure there is no danger to any irish fans or players

7220466 update and reform our copyright and patent systems to promote civic discourse innovation and investment while ensuring that intellectual property owners are fairly treated
7220467 that led me to publish pgp electronically for free that year shortly before the measure was defeated after vigorous protest by civil libertarians and industry groups
7220468 joe biden made his second attempt to introduce such legislation
7220469 justice should go ahead now to seek a legislative fix to the digital telephony problem and all parties should prepare to follow through on the encryption problem in about a year success with digital telephony will lock in one major objective we will have a beachhead we can exploit for the encryption fix and the encryption access options can be developed more thoroughly in the meantime
7220470 authorize the justice department to pick and choose crimes to investigate and prosecute based on political beliefs and associations
7220471 i drafted a terrorism bill after the oklahoma city bombing and the bill john ashcroft sent up was my bill
7220472 the democratic partys de facto spokesman on the war against terrorism
7220473 states to place social security numbers on drivers licenses and to obtain fingerprints or some other form of biometric identification for licenses
7220474 the fbi could get a wiretap to investigate the mafia but they could not get one to investigate terrorists to put it bluntly that was crazy whats good for the mob should be good for terrorists
7220475 the justice department had the ability to use wiretaps including roving taps in criminal investigations of terrorism just as in other criminal investigations long before the patriot act
7220476 presidents illegal wiretapping program that allows intelligence agencies to eavesdrop on the conversations of americans without a judges approval or congressional authorization or oversight
7220477 i think most americans would be absolutely shocked if they knew what kind of bone chilling information is making its way over the internet
7220478 you can access detailed explicit instructions on how to make and detonate pipe bombs light bulb bombs and even if you can believe it baby food bombs
7220479 the extent to which the first amendment protects such material and its private and commercial distribution
7220480 can withstand constitutional muster in most if not all of its possible applications if such legislation is slightly modified
7220481 have been found in possession of bomb making manuals and internet bomb making information
7220482 what is even worse is that some of these instructions are geared toward kids they tell kids that all the ingredients they need are right in their parents kitchen or laundry cabinets
7220483 video that lists the necessary ingredients and shows some self described rednecks blowing up small plastic bottles in their yard
7220484 we are deeply offended by the gratuitous accusations made against kazaa by witnesses before the committee including ludicrous attempts to associate an extremely beneficial next generation software program with organized criminal gangs and even terrorist organizations
7220485 crimes dangerous to the life limb and well being of minor children
7220486 at least one in person medical evaluation of the patient
7220487 to an individual under the age of 18 years including any such sale using the internet
7220488 the chairman will be required to hold this meeting in this largest room in the capitol and there will be lines wandering all the way down to the white house
7220489 whats becoming quite apparent is that the way you actually have an impact on health development and poverty alleviation is when people adopt certain behaviours
7220490 its just a matter of getting them to understand that what is a long established habit is in fact harmful and that you can do something about it
7220491 we actually use shame we go into communities and say to people do you realise how faecal contaminated your community is
7220492 we do walks of shame where you take a group of people and you walk around and you say look heres some human faeces here and somebody else has defecated there and you do this community mapping where everybody comes and says where they defecate
7220493 and you get them to realise how disgusting this is to live in an environment that is totally contaminated
7220494 and once they start using a toilet even if its just a pit latrine they refuse to go back to open defecation so they begin to climb the sanitation ladder
7220495 families were spending money on treating diarrhoea and other diseases but would not spend money on installing a toilet because they expected to be given money for that by aid groups
7220496 should a blog wiki document library web page widget or perhaps a custom data sheet be used to accomplish the task at hand
7220497 each one of us myself included is thinking is this really a good idea
7220498 i deeply esteem those who believe the issue of torture is so paramount that judge mukaseys views on it should be the sole determinant of our vote
7220499 the justice department is a shambles politicized and demoralized the belief and hope is that justice mukasey with his experience independence and integrity can restore the department motivates my vote
7220500 a new york times cbs news poll found that the public may have more patience than many assumed
7220501 76 percent of americans say theyd only withdraw some troops keeping enough to train iraqis and fight al qaeda or they would keep the same number of troops in iraq until the country is stabilized
7220502 to train iraqi forces conduct raids against terrorist groups and protect american diplomats
7220503 my job is to get him back to where he was before his rights were taken away
7220504 its pretty clear that its not a war without end
7220505 and as a matter of fact it is a war that actually has victory as its aim and victory is defined as helping the iraqis develop the capability of defending themselves and governing themselves
7220506 but i think speaker pelosi knows precisely well maybe she doesnt
7220507 maybe she just didnt follow general petraeuss testimony carefully enough but there is nothing in his testimony to insinuate that he looks upon this in the way she has characterized it
7220508 an attempt to try to create a political framework for ignoring the success that has taken place as a result of the surge in recent months
7220509 we made it clear that the purpose of net neutrality was to maintain equality on the internet for small businesses and for individuals
7220510 its not to allow these big corporations to use pricing and degrees of speed to limit others from being treated equally
7220511 over and over i stressed that it was up to the courts and congress to set the parameters for free speech not the telcos
7220512 i dont want to bring people together i want to win
7220513 i dont want to work with these people they cant be worked with i want to crush them i want to smash them into a fine powder and snort them
7220514 you have the republicans and their philosophy is that government doesnt work
7220515 so how could you possibly have a government that works because you would invalidate your ideology thats why bush puts people like horse lawyers in charge of fema
7220516 for more than five months the united states has been trying to orchestrate a political transition in pakistan that would manage to somehow keep gen pervez musharraf in power without making a mockery of president bushs promotion of democracy in the muslim world
7220517 now the white house is stuck in wait and see mode with limited options and a lack of clarity about the way forward
7220518 brazil has a huge amount of forest thats still there and that means brazil has a much greater role in terms of future deforestation
7220519 any changes that happen here have great influence on whether the earth gets warmer
7220520 i urge permatang pauh voters to once again give your votes to pkr and let anwar return to parliament and if there is a chance to lead this country as well
7220521 when they made accusations they go to the mosque hold the quran and swear in gods name but what about the other part of islam requirements
7220522 if they want to use syariah to swear that the crime did take place he accuser mohd saiful bukhari azlan should also present four credible witnesses
7220523 seven months of job losses for americans and seven houses for mccain
7220524 going round the country there is a sense that people are worried i understand this and i feel the hurt they feel
7220525 what the people of britain are concerned about is their mortgages their gas and electricity bills
7220526 guess what i came home from work today and me missus sprung a surprise on me apparently weve got an apartment in manhattan were joint owners of buckingham palace with some old dear and weve got a string of b amp bs in morecambe
7220527 my daughter knew him and then we got to know the family
7220528 its very hard to believe that something like this could happen here
7220529 but lately i have noticed the police are here a lot
7220530 theres so many occurrences like these that appear to be minor in nature until you link them up
7220531 the nature of the work is that with shifts and everything else we dont get to talk a lot as investigators
7220532 so you sort of have to be able to focus on all aspects of everything newspaper and media on tv are just another aspect of that
7220533 barack and i come from very different places but we share a common story
7220534 its not how many times you get knocked down its how quickly you get up
7220535 ladies and gentlemen thats your story thats americas story its about if you get up you can make it
7220536 in naming my colleague and friend senator joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee senator obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant
7220537 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7220538 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7220539 you said i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is
7220540 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7220541 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7220542 results of genetic testing from three samples of the products recalled by maple leaf foods show that two tested positive for the outbreak strain of listeria
7220543 test results for the third product were a close match to the outbreak strain but showed a slight variance
7220544 went the other way wed be starting to look again and widening the circle for other products this limits it to what we have been focusing on so it is good news
7220545 this is the toughest situation weve faced in the 100 years of this companys history
7220546 control freaks who are allowing their ideology to get in the way of common sense
7220547 in delaware the largest growth population is indian americans moving from india you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7220548 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
7220549 some people dont want to share maybe thats their right but thats when the problems start
7220550 this was nothing like public land being scooped up by property owners
7220551 its just a correction of an error in the deeds
7220552 with one stroke of the pen thousands of kilometres of coastline disappeared from public lands
7220553 itd be a different story if that land was never public but it was and we want it back
7220554 its devastating to have a black mark like this be what were known for
7220555 there were protests and marches it was at that point i could see a serious problem where there could be physical harm property damage that sort of thing
7220556 the township is not in a position to do that
7220557 its upsetting and it runs right up and down this whole shoreline is that what this bay is about
7220558 i didnt run for the position ill tell you that
7220559 i just thought somebody has to stand up to him
7220560 is still subject to interests in land that others may have by virtue of pre existing length of possession or use
7220561 surely a few days a year we can share it
7220562 all those people helped me they are as scared as i am
7220563 my education is not good but if you read all the letters ive sent the government you would think im a philadelphia lawyer
7220564 held them six inches from his nose then i turned around and walked away
7220565 you wont be able to tell that these kids arent professional
7220566 im so proud of these guys they really came through
7220567 these kids are fighting through a lot of personal challenges
7220568 theyre looking for affirmation and finding it in the wrong places
7220569 the movie taught me not to get involved in gangs because they wont let you leave its dangerous
7220570 ive seen a lot of people hurt and a lot of lives taken
7220571 i hope people see that in the movie kids should outlive their parents
7220572 every time you hear about a murder in malton you worry that it may have been one of your kids
7220573 it has enough of a presence now that id say a lot of teachers have had that experience
7220574 have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather expose them
7220575 radical terrorist groups in the border regions have undermined and fought against the central government of pakistan and carved out sanctuaries and training bases
7220576 they have come back and they are presenting a significant challenge
7220577 hes not likely to take gifts if you would with strings attached give me the tools dont give me the training
7220578 you hear it all the time i dont know that the pakistanis completely trust us
7220579 weve left the region before are we using them just for the war on terror and once afghanistan becomes a stable environment were going to go away
7220580 as a military guy every bone in your body says lets go find them and kill them you temper that with the fragility of the current government in islamabad by asking do you do more long term harm if you act very very aggressively militarily that debate continues and its very difficult
7220581 i genuinely believe that if we are going to eliminate al qaeda and the senior leadership we have to go where they are and they are in the tribal areas of pakistan
7220582 my opinion is there isnt that clear and present danger
7220583 every bit of intel they ever could gather was snippets
7220584 under every rock theres an al qaeda i dont think so
7220585 its nothing like it looks on tv and its all the bbcs fault
7220586 it seems hard to believe but with the hours we put in for last years show we were getting 6 an hour which is only just above the minimum wage
7220587 for 25 weeks of the year the dancers have to give their entire life over to strictly we eat sleep and breathe it were the only people involved in the show who work 16 hours a day seven days a week sometimes it feels like we dont have time to eat or sleep we didnt mind until they started asking us to do more and more and more
7220588 in the three years of working on the show i never once had a conversation with tess that wasnt on camera
7220589 they make it look like shes best mates with us all but she doesnt talk to us off camera she wouldnt know whats going on behind the scenes in a dance partnership
7220590 jonathan and piers are from a different generation alan is the tv face of the future hell ask celebrities questions the other two will be afraid to all the signs are hell be brilliant
7220591 life became very tough after i was dismissed but we remained hopeful of getting our jobs back however even after seven years we have yet to be rehired
7220592 only about 15 of these protestors worked at our hotel and i have video evidence to prove that the rest are outsiders and the protests are an attempt to blackmail us by the union leaders as the heavy tips made at a five star hotel are their real attraction
7220593 our occupancy rate dropped to 20 percent and in such conditions we could not afford the extra burden
7220594 recently the prime minister announced the removal of the ban on unions but these directives have yet to be enforced practically
7220595 die rijke minderheid moet dit zien als een verzekeringspremie tegen een ramp die in het beste geval niet gebeurt maar verwoestende effecten zal hebben op latere generaties zelfs als de conservatieve voorspellingen van het ipcc uitkomen
7220596 if recent russian actions are any indicator a technical excuse to completely block us access to the international space station for geopolitical reasons would fit nicely into the kremlin toolkit
7220597 on friday i wasnt hopeful at all that we could play the game in tbilisi
7220598 i was 95 per cent certain that the game would be played at a neutral ground
7220599 but it appears now that the russian troops are withdrawing as they promised and we are far more confident that we can put this game on safely in tbilisi
7220600 we are talking with our government to get assurances on security and the safety of visiting fans and players we will know for sure in the next couple of days
7220601 there will be 50 000 passionate fans there and it would be a very difficult game for ireland but we will make sure there is no danger to any irish fans or players
7220602 what shall i render to the lord for all his benefits to me
7220603 i will lift up the cup of salvation and call on the name of the lord
7220604 sometimes people look like they want to cry when they are paying for their groceries
7220605 when the 65 year old former army chief finally leaves his british colonial style residence inside rawalpindis army garrison for an expected pilgrimage to makkah in the next few days he may continue traveling on a lucrative speaking tour through the middle east europe and the us
7220606 the speaking fee for musharraf would be in the range of 150 000 200 000 dollars for a day plus jet and other vip arrangements on the ground
7220607 if we did multiple events in multiple cities musharraf could get closer to the 500 000 to 1 000 000 dollars range for a series of talks

7220696 albany n y has remarkable assets but everybody we talked to felt that albany is not making the most of its assets why its about making connections there are many plans north albany south end arbor hill midtown these are good plans but the connections are missing how do they relate to the rest of the city and to an overall vision for albanys future many important initiatives are going on but we sense that people dont always plan or carry out those initiatives together people and institutions are going off in different directions inside city government and between city government and the school district the state the universities the hospitals and so on the central question that albanys leaders must answer is this how can people make better connections complement each others efforts and make the most of their resources and energy
7220697 while the basic underlying regional market dynamics are favorable for investment the relative ease of access to the suburbs for albany workers in terms of travel time and cost means that the city must focus on creating a community that will attract lifestyle owners and renters rather than focusing on convenience as a major asset these principal assets will draw lifestyle oriented buyers and renters the citys great historic housing stock urban fabric and retail benefits to a sustainable environment
7220698 the historic fabric of downtown reflected in its streetscapes its buildings and ultimately its relationship to the hudson river is the areas greatest asset which will make the citys aspirations for the area possible to the extent that fabric is lost or compromised through poor planning and development decisions that loss will translate directly into fewer opportunities for economic development jobs and revenues

7220741 youre going to have to step out of your comfort zone
7220742 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
7220743 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
7220744 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
7220745 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
7220746 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
7220747 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
7220748 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
7220749 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
7220750 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
7220751 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
7220752 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
7220753 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
7220754 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
7220755 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
7220756 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
7220757 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
7220758 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
7220759 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
7220760 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
7220761 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
7220762 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
7220763 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
7220764 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
7220765 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
7220766 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
7220767 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
7220768 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
7220769 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
7220770 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
7220771 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
7220772 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
7220773 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country

7220777 so how we are going to use him and in what volume that remains to be seen
7220778 but he will be used as much as he can be used
7220779 we had a small part of the offense in the plan for austin and it was situational against teams that we thought might be vulnerable to a given thing or just situations we thought he could manage extremely well so it has been in place prior and then i would say there has been increased urgency where i wasnt pleased with our backup quarterback play last saturday that gave me more urgency now to think that role needs to be back and maybe expanded in the event that max were hurt or something like that

7220796 the goal of the summit is to provide the resources for businesses to begin implementing energy conservation plans
7220797 weve assembled a comprehensive team of energy experts to guide business leaders through the process
7220798 they conceded a goal then the crowd was not really good i was disappointed they didnt support the team
7220799 with the england team its always the same story they put everyone under pressure for the first 20 minutes but if they dont score an early goal it becomes difficult
7220800 playing for your club you can see the same england players are far more relaxed with the ball
7220801 there is concern at the very highest level that kate middleton still does not have a job one royal source told the newspaper
7220802 the queen is keen that the monarchy should lead by example and that the princes and their girlfriends should all be seen to be hard workers
7220803 the queen has made it known that she feels kate should get involved with a charity possibly an animal charity where she can be seen to be doing something proactive and something entirely safe
7220804 it is important that kate isnt seen to be doing anything controversial and she needs to do something completely different from any of the charity work that diana did
7220805 she has quite a bad reputation for being rude when it comes to responding to letters one friend told the newspaper
7220806 she often fails to rsvp when she is asked to attend events she once failed to reply to a wedding invitation from one of williams friends and it didnt go down very well

7220811 its my main responsibility as a head football coach to make sure the team is ready to play each and every week
7220812 hes continually adjusting his ideas and views throughout the program and developing it
7220813 he is a smart guy kids change and times change and people who are successful adjust to that
7220814 he has become more comfortable as a head coach and more understanding of us
7220815 a three year absence it has been too long this program is at the level we should have that in our sights every year
7220816 sometimes after ive poured my head and heart out to god ill take a breath long enough to ask
7220817 in his grace god reminds me once again that his love is true his love is real in those moments i cant help but wonder god why do you have to keep telling me you love me shouldnt i already know that by now am i just spiritually forgetful or is there something more page 35 most if not all of the sacred echoes of god throughout the bible orbit around the idea of relationship god offers countless incentives for engaging in a relationship with him thats why when i open the bible i dont just find instructions for life or a history book
7220818 the morning confirms what ive known for years that its better for me to begin prayer by talking to god rather than listening
7220819 your machines are inherently unsafe he told attendees in sydney today

7220826 i also believe there is one more group of poker machine addicts and that group is you the manufacturers the owners the operators he said

7220849 you guys have watched south carolina football for a lot of years youve seen a whole bunch of games where just a little smarter play here or just get a loose ball crucial penalty takes away a big play

7220882 one of the first rules of government is to do no harm particularly with the taxpayers dollars
7220883 im all for free trade but trade isnt free when you have the taxpayers subsidizing one company at the expense of others

7220926 a long term threat and a short term threat to our national security
7220927 for sen bidens iraq hearings to be anything more than a political sham used to invoke a modern day gulf of tonkin resolution equivalent for iraq his committee will need to ask hard questions and demand hard facts concerning the real nature of the weapons threat posed by iraq
7220928 everyone in the world thought he had them the weapons inspectors said he had them
7220929 preordained a conclusion that seeks to remove saddam hussein from power regardless of the facts and using these hearings to provide political cover for a massive military attack on iraq
7220930 as long as saddams at the helm there is no reasonable prospect you or any other inspector is ever going to be able to guarantee that we have rooted out root and branch the entirety of saddams program relative to weapons of mass destruction
7220931 the only way were going to get rid of saddam hussein is were going to end up having to start it alone
7220932 its going to require guys like you in uniform to be back on foot in the desert taking saddam down
7220933 one thing is clear these weapons must be dislodged from saddam or saddam must be dislodged from power
7220934 if we wait for the danger from saddam to become clear it could be too late
7220935 he did not snub the u n or our allies he did not dismiss a new inspection regime he did not ignore the congress at each pivotal moment he has chosen a course of moderation and deliberation
7220936 i do not believe this is a rush to war i believe it is a march to peace and security i believe that failure to overwhelmingly support this resolution is likely to enhance the prospects that war will occur

7220977 reliabilist account of epistemic justification is not refuted or in any way disconfirmed by the value problem thats because this reliabilist account of epistemic justification predicts nothing at all about what is good epistemically or otherwise it speaks only of epistemic justification not of epistemic goodness
7220978 typical or actual practical or moral consequences of holding the belief
7220979 is the problem of understanding why beliefs that are true because theyre justified are any better epistemically than beliefs that are merely true
7220980 it is not the hero alone that is deserving of credit since it is not because of her cognitive ability that she was cognitively successful so if we are to allow such cases it follows that there is sometimes a lot less to knowledge than apt belief
7220981 absolutely no doubt about it but the key is to stay within yourself not get too up or too down just try to take one day at a time the important thing to remember is that the olympics is not a sprint but a marathon
7220982 any medal would be exciting especially gold mongolia has never won gold
7220983 and theres only so many to win if theyre winning more someones winning less and here in beijing we didnt step it up like they did
7220984 its an artificial criteria totally opposed to the olympic philosophy
7220985 die olympischen spiele in peking waren f r adidas ein riesiger erfolg sowohl in china als auch weltweit
7220986 was markenpr senz w hrend der olympischen spiele angeht so waren wir in allen sportarten eindeutig die f hrende marke wir haben erstklassigen service und attraktive produkte geboten die speziell f r peking entwickelt wurden auch in der kommunikation haben wir durch unsere kampagne together in 2008 impossible is nothing akzente gesetzt sie hat beim cannes festival den ersten goldenen l wen f r china gewonnen somit haben uns die olympischen spiele in peking einen gro en schritt voran gebracht in unserer mission die f hrende sportmarke der welt zu werden
7220987 wir haben bereits die uefa euro 2008tm in sterreich und der schweiz genutzt um unsere f hrende position im fu ball weiter auszubauen und jetzt haben wir bei den olympischen spielen erneut gezeigt dass die marke adidas das herzst ck des sports ist durch die plattform der olympischen spiele 2008 in peking hat adidas hinsichtlich umsatz marktanteil und wahrnehmung der marke in china die marktf hrerschaft bernommen
7220988 unsere olympische reise geht weiter wir haben bereits mit den vorbereitungen f r die olympischen spiele 2012 in london begonnen wo adidas erneut official sportswear partner sein wird
7220989 wir sind auf dem besten weg unser ziel f r den konzernumsatz in china von mehr als 1 milliarde bis 2010 zu erreichen
7220990 die erfolgreichen olympischen spiele in peking hinterlassen ein verm chtnis f r den sport in china und f r alle marken unseres konzerns daher bin ich berzeugt dass wir in den kommenden jahren weiterhin dynamisches wachstum in diesem markt verzeichnen werden
7220991 for a subject to know a certain proposition some subjunctive conditional related to that subject and that proposition has to be true
7220992 there is a constitutive connection between knowledge and the truth of some subjunctive conditional
7220993 we should conclude that knowledge supports subjunctive conditionals of this sort
7220994 in each of the cases where there is knowledge there is an exercise of ability and a relevant subjunctive conditional is true
7220995 o ne of the primary motivations for dssc is the thought that even when ss belief that p is insensitive s can still count as knowing that p if she comes to believe that p on the basis of a competent deduction from her sensitive belief that not q
7220996 but look your belief is insensitive just like lottery beliefs
7220997 we can suppose if we want that i was dressed up as paul and that i decided to take the disguise off at the last minute just before arriving at the intersection where judy is
7220998 specifically it is not clear to me that there is knoweldge in a case where the testifier is very willing to lie about p if it suits her purposes and if the hearer would be fooled by the lie
7220999 suppose that the way i decide whether to dress up as michael is by flipping a coin heads i do tails i do not
7221000 so one might argue that a safety based account is not the best way to capture the idea that for a belief to qualify as knowledge it could not easily have been wrong perhaps this motivation is better captured by johns account in terms of ability or even by juans own positive account at the end of his synthese paper
7221001 in that case i suppose id rather not rely on the random belief evil demon hypothesis in trying to determine how best to read dsscs explanatory condition
7221002 but for it to follow from this that i know that the random belief evil demon hypothesis is false the above conditional must generate results for every belief that p that might have been placed in my mind by the random belief evil demon
7221003 r eplace p with i have hands you think that the resulting conditional is true right and you also think that you do know that you know that you have hands and that if you know this then your belief that you have hands wasnt placed in your mind by an evil demon right
7221004 but i know that the belief that i have hands wasnt placed in my mind by an evil demon is not equivalent to i know that the random belief evil demon hypothesis is false
7221005 the rise of compatibilism a case study in the quantitative history of philosophy
7221006 if x is true then we would expect y y is true therefore x is supported
7221007 if this be so as i imagine it is i leave it to be considered whether it may not help to put an end to that long agitated and i think unreasonable because unintelligible question viz whether mans will be free or no for if i mistake not it follows from what i have said that the question itself is altogether improper and it is as insignificant to ask whether mans will be free as to ask whether his sleep be swift or his virtue square liberty being as little applicable to the will as swiftness of motion is to sleep or squareness to virtue every one would laugh at the absurdity of such a question as either of these because it is obvious that the modifications of motion belong not to sleep nor the difference of figure to virtue and when any one well considers it i think he will as plainly perceive that liberty which is but a power belongs only to agents and cannot be an attribute or modification of the will which is also but a power
7221008 and therefore if a man should talk to me of a round quadrangle or accidents of bread in cheese or immaterial substances or of a free subject a free will or any free but free from being hindred by opposition i should not say he were in an errour but that his words were without meaning that is to say absurd
7221009 whats inconsistent with determinism isnt valuable and what is consistent with it is valuable
7221010 we used to think free will was this non sensical thing but actually it is this weaker sensical thing that captures more of what we used to think and i am going to therefore keep using the label free will
7221011 all the actions of the human being in appearance are determined in accord with the order of nature by his empirical character and the other cooperating causes and if we could investigate all the appearances of his power of choice down to their basis then there would be no human action that we could not predict with certainty
7221012 historians of philosophy notoriously disagree about how to interpret the philosophers
7221013 by freedom in the cosmological sense i understand the power of beginning a state of itself von selbst the causality of which does not in turn stand under another cause determining it in time in accordance with the law of nature
7221014 we have not been trying to establish the reality of freedom
7221015 we have not even tried to prove the possibility of freedom
7221016 nature at least does not conflict with causality through freedom
7221017 free will or free action or liberty or whatever the powers of agents that make them autonomous agents subject to judgments of responsibility
7221018 remedy the mistake of homunculizing the will a mistake that the existence of the phrase
7221019 its uncontroversial that descartes believed that the mind intervened in the causal order of the world through the pineal gland and thereby controlled the body perhaps someone could interpret that in a fully deterministic way but it sounds a lot like agent causation to me
7221020 what makes them revise it in favor of compatibilist free will
7221021 this is terrible we dont have free will thats really depressing
7221022 the major representatives of modern philosophy frequently do not fall neatly into contemporary categories
7221023 determinists will be more likely than indeterminists to be compatibilists
7221024 the incompatibilist can offer a plausible explanation for why the philosophical geography changes with indeterminist physics according to the incompatibilist the reason people are indeterminists in the early modern period is precisely because they believe in free will with quantum mechanics a different reason for indeterminism emerges and this complicates the philosophical space
7221025 those philosophers did i suggest start with a notion of choice that is incompatibilist and indeterminist why then did some of my faves endorse compatibilism because they were motivated by their commitment to determinism to do so
7221026 they might have thought that indeterminism is true of choice but inessential to free choice
7221027 if x is true then we would expect y y is true therefore x is supported
7221028 there is some question about the propriety of using statistical tests on this kind of material for certain assumptions about the standard statistical tests are not met for example one assumption for a chi square test is that the sample is randomly selected thats not the case here of course since the philosophers were not randomly selected by the anthologizers on the other hand the selection was not biased by the hypothesis that we are exploring if we think of statistics as a tool for uncovering patterns as opposed to an end in itself then we might think it worth at least considering the results of some simple analyses
7221029 the rise of compatibilism a case study in the quantitative history of philosophy
7221030 dit moet n stoppen en ik ga er dan ook n voor zorgen dat dit zo snel mogelijk is afgelopen

7221037 your daughter is dead why trouble the teacher any further
7221038 your daughter is dead why trouble the teacher any further
7221039 wil je eerlijk antwoord zeker weten neeeeeeeeeee nooit van mn leven
7221040 bij deze heb jij aangegeven dat je je problemen niet langer alleen aankan en dat je hulp wil maar anderzijds dat je heel snel van gedachten kan veranderen en er alles aan zal doen om onder de hulp uit te komen
7221041 ik zal er alles aandoen om te voorkomen dat jij onder afspraken uit kan komen
7221042 a host of insurmountable difficulties that plague the penal substitutionary view
7221043 they killed him not nor put him to death by nailing him to a cross
7221044 it is impossible for a prophet to die outside of jerusalem
7221045 james in his presentation allowed that the quran could mean that the jews did not kill jesus since the romans did
7221046 and thier saying we killed the messiah isa bin maryam and they did not kill him and they did not crucify him and it is obscure to them and certainly those who dispute in it are in doubt of it they have of it nothing of knowledge but pursue conjecture and they certainly did not kill him
7221047 what shall i do then with the one you call the king of the jews
7221048 look at the reality of what would have happened which is that the romans would only have crucified him if he were an insurrectionist or a murderer the two primary capital offenses they reserved for crucifixion
7221049 handed him over to them i e to the jews in order that they might crucify him
7221050 you cant even try to spin paul as saying that the
7221051 which is described as proposing that the whole bible is inspired but that only the religious teachings of the bible are inerrant and infallible
7221052 inspiration is a charism gift bestowed upon an entire community rather than upon words ideas or writers
7221053 where god is the principal author and the church the secondary author of scripture karl rahner
7221054 solidly faithfully and without error that truth which god wanted put into sacred writings 5 for the sake of salvation
7221055 1993 which defends the use of the historical critical approach to study the bible and emphasises the need to pay particular attention to the historical and cultural contexts in which the bible was written in order to better grasp its meaning
7221056 in the most trifling verbal minutiae even in the solecisms 11 of the sacred books
7221057 the contrast in belief that is illustrated by this point from fridays debate is this the christian focus when speaking of inspiration is on the nature of the written record that is as paul expressed it it is scripture itself not the instrument used in producing it that is god breathed
7221058 the specific name of the writer is not the issue
7221059 white appears to be unaware of church history something i will explore in the next section
7221060 during the cross examination shabir ally asked me about the book of hebrews in the new testament he asked if we know who wrote it and i said we do not he took this as clear evidence that it cannot possibly be inspired since it is anonymous this is related to the islamic insistence that we must know the character of a prophet and that the character of that prophet is directly related to the authority of the word he proclaims
7221061 this is why the specific name of the writer is not the issue
7221062 is a valid and reasonable question it is a question which will come to your mind even if you are a non muslim the early christians while being inconsistent in their procedure maintained a concern for authorship related issues as well
7221063 the specific name of the writer is not the issue
7221064 exemplifies an important difference between the muslim and christian attitude towards the assessment of evidence
7221065 if the muslim wishes to argue that the name of the writer of a book of scripture must be known upon what basis is this to be argued
7221066 but what precisely is supposed to be ironic here is never spelt out
7221067 the etymological fallacy and quranic studies muhammad paradise and late antiquity
7221068 was jesus christ crucified as a willing sacrifice for the sins of gods people
7221069 i am asserting that the reason shabir ally sits here this evening in denial of the thesis is due to these 40arabic words traceable to the quran
7221070 the revision done of the quranic texts ordered by uthman and undertaken by a committee chosen by him sometime after the middle of the seventh century
7221071 the fewer quantity of words in a quranic passage the lesser its importance
7221072 as a willing sacrifice for the sins of gods people
7221073 and indeed we know that they polytheists and pagans say
7221074 yet only god knows its interpretation those who are versed in knowledge say
7221075 the texts in hammam and those recorded in ibn hanbal bukhari and muslim with the same isnad show almost complete identity except for a few omissions and interpolations which do not affect the sense of the reports on the other hand the same ahadith as told by other transmitters in the three collections studied show a rich variety of wording again without changing the meaning of the reports
7221076 the musannaf of abd al razzaq al san ani as a source of authentic ahadith of the first century a h
7221077 the secret of the kingdom of god has been given to
7221078 the funny thing is there is no surviving original manuscript of josephus they are all derived from xian sources every single one
7221079 they neither killed him in general nor did they kill him by the specific means of impalement on a cross
7221080 they did not kill him by impaling him on a cross
7221081 we killed christ jesus the son of mary the apostle of allah
7221082 it would be fair to say that in 99 999 of the cases the romans proved to be excellent executioners
7221083 purposefully taken down to try and save their lives at the request of a person of influence and power
7221084 the assertion that paul and all the nt writers were simply dishonest
7221085 but if through my falsehood gods truthfulness abounds to his glory why am i still being condemned as a sinner
7221086 all things to all men so that by any means possible he may win some to christ
7221087 placing ones faith in the wrong thing such as believing that the scriptures must be inerrant according to rather strict idiosyncratic standards and that we must be able to harmonize the four gospels
7221088 the unreasonable assumption that jesus contemporaries that is the first generation of his movement were either incapable of remembering or uninterested in recalling accurately what jesus said and did and in passing it on
7221089 that is thinking that the more skeptical the position the more critical it is
7221090 it sure sounds as if a rigid fundamentalist understanding of scripture laid the foundation of his funks formative years
7221091 funk goes on to say that learning was an agonizing experience i have heard that before how breaking away from a fundamentalist understanding of scripture can be emotionally devastating
7221092 as best i can extract from his autobiography robinson is talking about calvinist theology and a conservative view of scripture
7221093 but in my estimation what he robinson says is comparable to a watered down version of ebionite christology
7221094 virtually no scholar trained in history will agree with prices negative conclusions
7221095 what we see in price is what we have seen before a flight from fundamentalism
7221096 show me one mistake in the bible and i will throw out the whole thing
7221097 but of that day and hour no one knows not even the angels of heaven but the father only
7221098 but of that day and hour no one knows not even the angels of heaven nor the son but the father only
7221099 but of that day or that hour no one knows not even the angels in heaven nor the son but only the father
7221100 there is no reason to abandon the view of colin roberts that p64 and p67 date from the end of the second century
7221101 in conclusion p4 p66 p67 is a second century manuscript exhibiting an early form of the biblical uncial hand and thus should be dated to the late second century ca 175
7221102 the use and significance of patristic evidence for nt textual criticism
7221103 issues in new testament textual criticism moving from the nineteenth century to the twenty first century
7221104 the gospel codex cannot have been written much if at all after ad 200
7221105 even though the book was in many ways informative and that i agree with evans about the non canonical gospels they are later than the canonical gospels and are more unlikely to contain any real history he does not say anything that would cause me to rethink me position concerning religion

7221122 all who delve into american history must contend with a language of misnomer and condescension

7221126 the frontier is a virgin wilderness tamed by heroic pioneers the real frontier was a rolling three century war zone from 1607 to 1890 in which the continent violently changed hands
7221127 isolated and unschooled the frontier became a breeding ground for militarism and religious extremism the two aspects of american culture that outsiders and many americans find most alarming today especially when they converge in government policy as they did under ronald reagan and again more strongly under george w bush

7221139 i was knocked out cold when i was hit in the head with a beer during a michigan concert
7221140 i grew up in the upper west side in the 70s there were fires and riots and serial killers it was great my kids its l a its sunny and nice they dont have any excitement
7221141 i grew up around a lot of aggressive guys my parents used to take me to aa meetings when i was very young so i know aggression i know insanity
7221142 its going to be in the orchards and its going to bear some wonderful fruit
7221143 how strange it was to see men do something beautiful something pointless and elegant as though no one saw or cared in sawyer a town of millers and loggers and dairy farmers with one butcher and a rep from the rural bank beside the bp men did solid practical things mostly with their hands
7221144 with a brilliant smile and the early facial creases of happy dissipation he was known for being cranky curious passive aggressive and most of all persnickety
7221145 and part of me did feel like i have to set the record straight but the reality is that its never going to not be talked about
7221146 i could tell that big was crying through the phone
7221147 and that shook me even more that wasnt bigs style
7221148 there are times throughout the book where im like i would never do that now there are things i wouldnt even think about doing but at that time that was how i felt whatever my anger or frustration was in that particular moment it happened to be with lil kim
7221149 ive gotten over any ill feelings a long time ago
7221150 even once big died there was no common denominator there was no reason to harbor any bad feelings
7221151 she said you should do it but be ready to cry be ready to laugh
7221152 she was just like its a process but you should do it
7221153 the stadium was as broad as the circus maximus of ancient rome

7221159 the real problem is that it tells us almost nothing that we have not been told before
7221160 i have a very nice full bodied petite sirah that has a wonderful flavor im also pretty proud of a white cabernet and a white merlot we bottled in 2003 our cabernet sauvignon has been rated at 91 by the wine spectator our white 90 thats pretty amazing
7221161 i own tequila tres rios a bar in las vegas and the vineyard dude just because im still wild on stage doesnt mean im still f up im really proud of what were doing we just bottled a great white cab at about 19

7221165 right now we are right at the place we want to be
7221166 last year at the all city competition he kexin moved from one team to another and during the process of registering during the move there appeared this age discrepancy
7221167 so it was the appearance of a mistake in the process of transferring teams that the misunderstanding appeared however i can right here accurately say that the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7221168 all information is in chinese and the federation is making as thorough analysis as possible of the papers
7221169 this process may take some time but in due course the fig will make a full report of our findings to the international olympic committee
7221170 the international federation has required the delivery of birth certificates and all the documents like family books entries in schools and things like that
7221171 they have received the documents and at first sight it seems to be ok
7221172 the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7221173 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
7221174 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
7221175 het cordon is een spijtige zaak omdat het de vlaamse onderhandelingspositie verzwakt tegelijk zijn we blij dat een partij die de vlaamse onafhankelijkheid in haar programma heeft staan electoraal zo veel succes heeft ik weet wel dat er gezegd wordt dat de mensen niet voor het vlaams belang stemmen wegens de vlaamse standpunten van die partij maar tegelijk blijkt uit de stemmenkampioen van het laatste nieuws dat het kiezerskorps van het vlaams belang het hoogste percentage voorstanders van vlaamse onafhankelijkheid telt
7221176 i am deeply saddened by the passing of peter boyle
7221177 he gave me great advice he always made me laugh and the way he connected with everyone around him amazed me the fact that he could play a convincing curmudgeon on the show but in reality be such a compassionate and thoughtful person is a true testament to his talent
7221178 hes just obnoxious in a nice way just for laughs
7221179 its a very sweet experience having this success happen at a time when you basically go back over your life and see every mistake you ever made
7221180 and i hired him because i was afraid of him
7221181 i knew right away that he had a comic presence
7221182 peter was an incredible man who made all of us who had the privilege of working with him aspire to be better actors he was loved by everyone that knew him and loved by his many fans who cherished his talent
7221183 being able to share nine years with peter on raymond and witness his talent and humanity was an honor
7221184 i felt the call for awhile then i felt the normal pull of the world and the flesh
7221185 we were both seekers after a truth looking for a quick way to enlightenment
7221186 hes just obnoxious in a nice way just for laughs
7221187 its a very sweet experience having this happen at a time when you basically go back over your life and see every mistake you ever made

7221213 securing for oneself more than one needs in a world where so many children die because they dont have what they need is unjust this injustice must be protected with violence structural violence as well as violence through oppression and weapons
7221214 but thanks be to god that though you used to be slaves to sin you have come to obey from your heart the pattern of teaching that has now claimed your allegiance you have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness
7221215 to those who by persistence in doing good seek glory honor and immortality he will give eternal life but for this who are self seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil there will be wrath and anger
7221216 i consider everything a lost because of the surpassing worth of knowing christ jesus my lord for whose sake i have lost all things i consider them garbage that i may gain christ and be found in him not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law but that which is through faith in christ the righteousness that comes from god on the basis of faith
7221217 for it is by grace you have been saved through faith and this is not from yourselves it is the gift of god not by works so that no one can boast for we are gods handiwork created in christ jesus to do good works which god prepared in advance for us to do
7221218 see what i can do i can do this with a human life
7221219 tis a spiritual sight of god and the things of god

7221222 poti is outside of the security zone but that does not mean we will sit behind a fence watching them riding around in hummers
7221223 now that georgia has actually acknowledged being an aggressor and is asking for the potential of its armed forces to be restored it can be restored only for another act of aggression
7221224 i didnt think it likely that a member of the un security council and the osce would react like this

7221268 theres been a lot of enthusiastic talk and true belief that tall ships is an event that this community wants to have
7221269 but we cant go ahead until we pay off the deficit for 2008 we have to do that first
7221270 in our minds the festival was a success because of the overwhelming community support it received the positive reception the crews received and the hundreds of thousands of visitors who attended and had a great time
7221271 we provided an extraordinary event for hundreds of thousands of people
7221272 while we still need court approval of our plan we believe the end of this complex bankruptcy is finally in sight
7221273 this plan will allow the company to emerge from bankruptcy in a manner that is fair to all of its constituencies and puts asarcos assets under ownership of a world class global mining company
7221274 this case continues to be the biggest wildcard in the bankruptcy and we have asked for an extraordinary result
7221275 i played for the first time when we moved out here

7221283 mostly i just wanted to thank him for taking a stand for peace
7221284 were followers of him who share his passion and compassion
7221285 i think hes a great man because of his unflinching love of people in any circumstance and his undying love for the poor and the left out
7221286 i dont agree with anyone who breaks the law in any way

7221292 hes just not afraid civil disobedience is about breaking unjust laws
7221293 i never get the sense that i am a lawbreaker or that i am a criminal
7221294 i believe the possession of nuclear weapons is incompatible with the non violence of jesus

7221362 reductions in government spending on goods and services or reductions in transfer payments to lower income families are likely to be more damaging to the economy in the short run than tax increases focused on higher income families
7221363 ordinarily in a recession the state extends its help to those hardest hit
7221364 this plan does the opposite reducing access to childrens health care job training and transportation hurts the very families most affected by the downturn why cut the building blocks to success for children and the future workforce
7221365 minnesota is losing jobs and the governor proposes to cut jobs with his budget proposal
7221366 the governors budget proposal is flat out irresponsible it hurts people hurts the economy and does not address the revenue shortfall with a revenue solution
7221367 we dont need to take more families off the track to success
7221368 our elected officials need to find real solutions to the revenue shortfall the invest in minnesota campaign will engage the public in a search for solutions to the revenue shortfall during this legislative session and the months ahead our goal to solve the revenue shortfall and get minnesota back on the right track
7221369 minnesota should be looking for fair ways to raise more revenue instead of cutting and disinvesting
7221370 there are reasonable and fair revenue options for preserving and even expanding the vital public investments that have always provided a foundation for shared prosperity the legislature should not give up on those options
7221371 your machines are inherently unsafe he told attendees in sydney today
7221372 when other products have been found to cause significant harm to a significant number of users they have been banned
7221373 the people who make your industry so wealthy are so addicted to your product that they will jeopardise their own financial well being and the well being of their families he said
7221374 they will steal from their partners their bosses and their children just to churn money through your machines
7221375 you call it entertainment or gaming i call it obscene
7221376 sickened during the mid 1990s when working as a lawyer he would see people lose their personal injury payouts to poker machines including an intellectually impaired man who lost almost 30 000
7221377 addicted and reluctant to wind back poker machine numbers because every year they reaped almost 4 billion in gaming taxes he said
7221378 i also believe there is one more group of poker machine addicts and that group is you the manufacturers the owners the operators he said
7221379 i am not willing to accept that you dont see the harm that you do
7221380 you do yet you choose to do it anyway and that may be the saddest part of this sad sad situation
7221381 agree with pretty much all of what senator xenophon just said im not offended and we need to have this debate
7221382 i know that clubs have done an enormous amount in the last 10 years and theres more to do mr newell said
7221383 youve got ipart who are beholden to nobody theyve said that clubs cant survive mr newell said
7221384 i dont know what we would have done without coverage
7221385 my baby had to have an mri done for one of her vertebrae thats not formed the problem was found at her one year checkup which we wouldnt have been able to afford without coverage
7221386 i would love to have a carnival where there is no crime at all are we going to achieve it we will do our best
7221387 whats the point of being nervous its done and gone its not like a stage performance where i can improve on the performance mumbai meri jaan and maan gaye mughall e azam are very different films am i proud of both films im happy with both films i was even proud of a few of my three scenes in shaurya
7221388 i got to do comedy again in maan gaye mughall e azam this is an entirely new genre for me the director sanjay chhel comes from gujarati theatre i play a ghazal singer haldi hassan with a roving eye slightly sleazy and though i sing quite well i left it to the professional playback singers to sing for me im only an actor
7221389 but genres are not relevant i leave it to the pundits to segregate by genre i go by what the script requires from me for me acting is cathartic it gives me a chance to be and do what i wouldnt in real life we actors are a blessed lot acting gives me a chance to recognise myself
7221390 i play an unemployed guy he can apply himself to work but chooses not to and hangs around with younger boys in an irani caf its all very interestingly done
7221391 i used to joke about me being a garlanded photograph in sarkar raj that didnt happen
7221392 sarkar was one of my most popular films im quite happy with the work i do im getting to live my life the way i do
7221393 i am a complete foodie luckily i am blessed with good genes
7221394 theres a growing need to make hair feel more natural however researchers still are scrambling to put hair care on a firm scientific footing
7221395 at one point i wanted to be a journalist then i was at the receiving end now after playing a tv journalist in mumbai meri jaan im more sympathetic towards the medias job
7221396 i understand why they need to ask uncomfortable questions of course i still wont answer personal questions but i understand the journalist has a right to ask what he or she wants to
7221397 my job brings me into daily contact with the media and i watch the news closely recently when we had 23 bomb attacks in 24 hours i watched the full coverage theres too much of de sensitised lurid sensational coverage on tv
7221398 i play one of those hard nosed trp driven journalists i play a journalist who forgets that during those times the people being interviewed are human then i undergo a crisis and change
7221399 though were together in mumbai meri jaan we dont have scenes together i told him at the beginning of dil kabaddi to guide me if needed yes im open to advice provided its done without lecturing and it should be given after im well fed
7221400 i was surrounded by powerhouse actors like paresh rawal kay kay menon irrfan r madhavan i was the least experienced of the lot and i was apprehensive
7221401 i am a complete foodie luckily i am blessed with good genes
7221402 i dont know when i will go back to tv if my films dont do well i will have to go back but right now im doing films and i hope it takes me somewhere
7221403 it is not that i dont want to go back to my tv image of wearing saris but it is too early to do all that again i have other films in hand also so tv will wait for now
7221404 what i was doing on tv was very regressive i have done nothing for my looks in the film it was all abhisheks vision it was all that he wanted me to do in the film and all thanks to the people who have worked on my styling i just had to carry the character
7221405 my characters name is sakshi and i play adityas farhans wife in the film it is very unlike what you have seen me do on tv i play a more sophisticated character who is a mature girl and very positive of course somebody who can do anything to see her husband happy

7221408 i didnt even know it was a tear there was a lot of pain in bangkok and i didnt know what it was i thought it was a problem related to my flat feet but after i returned to mumbai and finished with johns abraham brothers wedding reception i got an mri done it showed a tear
7221409 its a very common occurrence in the legs of active people like dancers and athletes that tear just stays theres no cure for it if you lead a routine life it doesnt bother you at all otherwise theres arthroscopy but my orthopaedic surgeons have not advised it i can walk work out dance do everything
7221410 i didnt want to inconvenience anyone during the shooting so as a precautionary measure i kept a therapist around because during a dance movement there was some swelling none of the dance steps changed dancing is a routine activity so the therapist was just a precautionary measure
7221411 its part of our job its no big deal you just have to understand your body and be careful four years back i ran with the wrong shoes it caused a knee problem i immediately corrected that i believe in long term health and when i work out i listen to my body if any part of my body gives me any pain i stop immediately and no trainer can push me
7221412 race was a hit and if freeze turns out a success theyll think my pushing heroes off buildings is lucky for a film everyone will start writing in a heroine pushes hero scene into all my scripts im becoming a hero pusher

7221418 nuestra estrategia de inversi n est prevista a dos a os vista repercutiendo en dos ejercicios econ micos y no solo en uno no estamos pensando nicamente en esta temporada sino tambi n en la que viene de nuevo en primera
7221419 hay que tener en cuenta que el real zaragoza adem s de esos gastos ha percibido un dinero importante durante el verano gracias a los casos de aimar scar lafita e incluso la parte que faltaba por ingresar de la venta de dalessandro
7221420 es verdad que el real zaragoza est ahora en esa situaci n de gastos sin embargo estamos planteando la inversi n en una propuesta de recomposici n y reconstrucci n de la plantilla con objetivos a dos a os vista
7221421 no fichamos de forma inconsciente tratamos de encontrar tambi n jugadores polivalentes y necesarios que como en el caso de pignol vengan con la carta de libertad nuestra intenci n es combinar la contrataci n de jugadores que cuestan dinero en concepto de traspaso con otros que no
7221422 somos conscientes de la dif cil situaci n econ mica del real zaragoza por ello tenemos siempre presente que hay que buscar un equilibrio entre los objetivos deportivos y las posibilidades econ micas
7221423 el escal n que se vive en el d a a d a entre la primera y la segunda divisi n es grand simo hay una brecha enorme sobre todo en el apartado de los ingresos por televisi n
7221424 hay otros clubes que est n mucho peor que nosotros varios est n afectados por la ley concursal y por lo tanto su capacidad de decisi n est restringida a lo que determinan los administradores concursales lo curioso es que esos clubes van a competir con nosotros clubes que en alg n caso nos deben dinero
7221425 yo pronostico que en esta semana que viene se van a acelerar muchas operaciones todav a se van a producir muchas m s novedades tanto de entrada como de salida de jugadores
7221426 estamos demostrando que sabemos responder a las propuestas del t cnico es muy posible que la pr xima semana tengamos todas esas incorporaciones que l solicita
7221427 el problema es la escasez de agentes falta de presupuesto y mala organizaci n

7221432 i would never put myself in the same category as phelps or usain bolt theyre multiple gold medallists but i think just because it was chinas national sport and they were so sure to win it was one of their definite events
7221433 i dont think it will sink in for a while
7221434 i know i have a medal because i can feel it i can touch it and i can see it but it doesnt feel like gold
7221435 winning an olympic gold medal and being the very best in the world is something i cant comprehend yet
7221436 i left the sport without any intention of returning i had fallen out of love with diving
7221437 i wouldnt be here if i hadnt taken the time off i know it for sure because i came back with such a drive and such fierce competitive spirit
7221438 chava called me up one day and said no pressure but if ever you want to start diving again im very happy to coach you
7221439 then march 2007 was the melbourne world championships and i was getting all these messages from my diving friends who are all from overseas saying you should be here
7221440 i really wanted to go but couldnt afford the flight down to melbourne so i started training not long after that because i didnt want to miss something like that again wallabies record significant win
7221441 elke dag vijf dagen in de week moest ik rond een of twee uur weg eerst met de trein naar almelo waar mijn chauffeur me ophaalde en naar oldenzaal reed drie uur trainen en weer terug meestal was ik rond acht uur s avonds thuis
7221442 bij de overstap naar het tak hebben we meteen besloten dat ik het examen gespreid over twee jaar zou doen daar ben ik nu heel blij mee want anders weet ik niet of ik het allemaal wel gered zou hebben
7221443 dat mocht omdat ik topsporter ben ik geloof niet dat ik er uiteindelijk iets mee ga doen
7221444 dat weet ik pas sinds dit jaar ik vind het fijn dat ik daardoor een half uur langer over mijn examens mag doen die tijd heb ik echt nodig
7221445 eigenlijk was ik altijd slecht in duits maar sinds ik weet dat ik dyslectisch ben en meer tijd heb voor de toetsen haal ik goede cijfers
7221446 vier weken na de operatie zou ik weer moeten kunnen volleyballen maar dat gaat nog steeds niet ik kan bijvoorbeeld nog niet springen

7221454 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7221455 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond
7221456 we heard about these cases and we discussed them with the chinese authorities and the reply we received was that this was an application of chinese law the ioc is not a sovereign organisation and we have to accept chinese law
7221457 it is a particularly nasty weapon that can literally take someones head off we are very glad it is off the streets and we want more weapons handed in
7221458 i am someone you do not want to fuck with
7221459 im truly and deeply saddened it had to go this way
7221460 the really sad piece of this is whats important in life is friends and family
7221461 the only comment i can make is its a family matter its a tragic family matter
7221462 i think i understand accounting im on five public audit committee boards im the chairman of two ive been the chairman of the audit committee of probably the second largest financial institution in the country
7221463 he and a set of his colleagues were going to leave fairchild and start another company and wanted me to participate in this activity if id invest and come on the board and be a colleague of his
7221464 after a conference that the government ordered or orchestrated national security agency on how to build a very fast machine

7221467 the evidence indicates both guzy parents ignored the existence of the childrens trusts and the terms of the 1977 agreement
7221468 al met een eendaagse cursus sociale vaardigheden waarbij het baasje de meest elementaire zaken wordt geleerd kunnen heel wat problemen worden voorkomen
7221469 maar zoals zo vaak is de financiering een probleem in onze opzet wordt de cursus betaald door de gemeenten die daarvoor putten uit het potje hondenbelasting in ruil krijgen gemeenten toegang tot de landelijke database zodoende zijn ze exact op de hoogte van het bestaan van iedere hond dat levert weer extra hondenbelasting op
7221470 het socialiseren van de pups is n maar het opvoeden van de eigenaar is ook hard nodig
7221471 misschien moeten we sommige honden maar muilkorven in de publieke ruimte ik wil me best sterk maken voor die sociale veiligheid
7221472 hoe meer mensen het weten hoe beter een aankoop moet nooit een impulsaankoop zijn maar verplichten nee
7221473 bijvoorbeeld voor minder mobiele ouderen op het platteland terwijl zij heel goed met een hondje kunnen omgaan
7221474 uitstekend als de verkoper van een hond een cursus aanraadt maar een verplichting gaat te ver

7221491 theres a fire drill we have to go outside get up
7221492 bad for them its bad for morale and you end up with a potential riot on your hands among people who have to be compensated
7221493 we hebben een complex institutioneel systeem waarin we de beleidsmensen op n lijn moeten proberen te krijgen
7221494 we moeten ook tussentijds de balans opmaken en niet om de vier jaar zien waar we staan
7221495 tegen het einde van het jaar moeten we een actieplan klaarhebben londen 2012 begint vandaag al
7221496 ik ben blij dat we na die lange droogte toch zilver en goud behaald hebben die twee medailles moeten een signaal zijn
7221497 het begint bij de basis onze scholen moeten meer gaan investeren in sport
7221498 maar we moeten positief blijven en er blijven in geloven als over tien jaar blijkt dat we na ef geweest zijn dan hebben we gefaald
7221499 we hadden drie doelstellingen vooropgesteld en twee daarvan hebben we niet gehaald
7221500 we wilden dat 50 procent van onze atleten een top 8 plaats zou behalen maar het was maar 40procent niet geslaagd dus
7221501 we hadden ook vijf sporten geselecteerd waarvan we een medaille konden verwachten maar we scoorden enkel in het atletiek weer niet geslaagd dus
7221502 de derde doelstelling was dat de atleten zichzelf zouden overtreffen wat dat betreft mogen we tevreden zijn
7221503 kehadiran musafir abdul ghafar di fatagar lama pada tahun 1360 m dan juga disusul dengan siti masita dan pedagang bugis bone sekitar 1502 m tidaklah merupakan sesuatu yang mustahil karena dalam dokumen negarakartagama di masa raja hayam wuruk kerajaan majapahit jazirah onin telah tertulis dalam kitab tersebut dengan sebutan kata ewanim dan sran untuk sebutan teluk beraur bintuni
7221504 yang membawa kitab kitab ini adalah keturunan dari raja pasai yang bernama syekh iskandarsyah yang kemudian bertemu dengan raja pertama patipi i bernama kris kris
7221505 dalam catatan evolusi nasional irian yang ditulis oleh marthen vijay kemudian dalam buku sejarah masuknya islam dan kristen di irian yang ditulis oleh pendeta honin sudah ada pengakuan pengakuan itu
7221506 sekarang kami berupaya bagaimana ke depan sinar sinar islam itu bisa bersinar di seluruh daerah di bintuni
7221507 karena saat itu tidak adanya imam dan kurangnya pembinaan terhadap umat islam akhirnya mereka termakan bujuk rayu misionaris untuk masuk kristen karena iming iming materi
7221508 inilah hidup yang kekal itu yaitu bahwa mereka mengenal engkau satu satunya allah yang benar dan mengenal yesus kristus yang telah engkau utus
7221509 beritahukanlah dan kemukakanlah alasanmu ya biarlah mereka berunding bersama sama siapakah yang mengabarkan hal ini dari zaman purbakala dan memberi tahukannya dari sejak dahulu bukankah aku tuhan tidak ada yang lain tidak ada allah selain dari pada ku allah yang adil dan juruselamat tidak ada yang lain kecuali aku
7221510 hatiku sangat sedih seperti mau mati rasanya tinggallah di sini dan berjaga jagalah dengan aku
7221511 ya bapaku jikalau sekiranya mungkin biarlah cawan ini lalu dari padaku tetapi janganlah seperti yang kukehendaki melainkan seperti yang engkau kehendaki
7221512 kepada siapakah kamu hendak menyamakan aku hendak membandingkan dan meng umpamakan aku sehingga kami sama
7221513 maha suci engkau tidaklah patut bagiku mengatakan apa yang bukan hakku jika aku pernah mengatakan maka tentulah engkau mengetahui apa yang ada pada diriku dan aku tidak mengetahui apa yang ada pada diri engkau sesungguhnya engkau maha mengetahui perkara yang ghaib ghaib
7221514 i just saw bottle shock what was up with chris pines wig
7221515 they saw the pics i had an afro not that straight stuff and besides we got no creative input on the movie beyond making sure the actors werent holding the pruning shears upside down heidi bos wife got to supervise the tasting scenes
7221516 i thought the glassware in those scenes looked kind of modern
7221517 but they got the jelly jars right plenty of folks used those back then

7221525 obama as the puppet of biden the way they joked or intimated that bush is a puppet of cheney
7221526 if we cant trust what he says about obama how can we trust what he says about how he would improve the economy

7221531 is it true democrats drink from a sippy cup and sleep with the light on
7221532 ive been hitting all my old haunts the bowling alleys the gun clubs talking to the guys i grew up with
7221533 they dont like democrats they dont like liberals and i tell them you dont have to become one you can keep hating them but you have to agree with me that the last eight years have not worked
7221534 at this point we need to try anything and obama is anything and if he doesnt do the job we can throw the bum out in four years
7221535 the conservatives already have a party its the republican party and the more obama tries to sound like them the more he makes their message sound okay the people on the fence want to hear something real
7221536 cmon fight for something here nobody wants to belong to a party of wusses obama needs to come down on mccain and come down hard not him personally but the things he stands for are so old and wrong
7221537 i am required to respond in the following manner yes he has a great chance of winning

7221541 thirty seven percent of the colleges fleet runs on some form of renewable energy including biodiesel
7221542 using the butter sculpture is a unique way to fuel the esf fleet
7221543 this separates out the triglycerides which will be split in our reactor at esf a process known as transesterification that creates the biodiesel
7221544 dairy farmers are the original environmentalists recycling nutrients and water on their land so it makes sense that this annual tribute to them is itself finding new life in fuel rather than being discarded
7221545 this is a fitting way to mark the sculptures 40th anniversary
7221546 as onondaga countys local recycling agency ocrra is thrilled with this innovative project

7221555 the president of the human rights party said that a request will not be made to the king to delay the meeting for the new national assembly swearing in ceremony thinking that such a request would not be successful the president of the human rights party mr kem sokha reported to
7221556 the president of the human rights party an ally of the sam rainsy party together rejecting the election results on 27 july 2008 said we will not make a request disturbing the king because we know that previously although we had made requests to him many times he has no possibility to help us much since everything depends on decisions by the government
7221557 according to the temporary results announced by the nec on 9 august 2008 the cambodian peoples party will receive 90 seats the sam rainsy party will receive 26 seats the human rights party 3 seats the norodom ranariddh party 2 seats and funcinpec also 2 seats
7221558 however legal experts said that according to article 76 of the constitution the supreme law of the nation a new national assembly cannot hold its inaugural meeting unless there are at least120 parliamentarians attending otherwise that new national assembly cannot function and a new government cannot be formed
7221559 relating to the plan by the nec to announce the official results of the elections on 7 september 2008 legal experts commented to the nec that it should finish solving the many complaints of the opposition parties about irregularities during the election day and days before the elections
7221560 according to high ranking officials of the nec they said that although there are complaints to the nec or to the constitutional council the announcement of the fourth term parliamentary election results will be made officially as planed on 7 september 2008 at the latest and all complaints will have been solved before the day when the election results will be announced
7221561 the sam rainsy party and the human rights party had announced to boycott attending the first meeting of the national assembly on 24 september 2008 demanding a new vote in order to provide justice to more than one million khmer citizens who had lost their right to vote moreover the presidents of both parties have collected many documents as proof regarding the irregularities of the elections to be sent to the united nations and the european community to help to seek justice for khmer citizens because the fact that one million of khmer citizens lost the right to vote is a serious irregularity if the results are to be announced by the nec on 7 september 2008 it is not in line with the will of the khmer citizens

7221597 two things are enabling us to establish this new paradigm
7221598 first is the advancement in microelectronics which provides us greater density and speed at much lower power consumption than ever before the other is a better understanding of neuroscience and how the brain functions at the synaptic neuronal network and system levels
7221599 the follow on phases of the project will create a technology that functions like the brain of a cat which comprises 108 neurons and 1012 synapses

7221622 the illegal new goshawk guidelines allow logging big trees at the peril of mature forests and wildlife across two states
7221623 were relieved that the forest services analysis demonstrated that their own new guidelines are illegal
7221624 if the new rule cant be used legally here it cant be used in any arizona or new mexico national forest
7221625 todays decision confirms what weve been saying for a year now the new rule is illegal it would harm public forests and wildlife and it should be formally withdrawn
7221626 i still worry that some environmental groups can still challenge us on whether we are correctly interpreting forest plan guidelines as they were originally intended
7221627 i know there is going to be some worry about the interpretation lets just make sure we do quality nepa and other analysis on the first ones
7221628 in a region perilously unable to restore millions of acres of degraded forests this comes as an astounding distraction that threatens fragile agreements upon which restoration ultimately depends
7221629 the irony here is that major restoration industry players and environmentalists agree on the need to protect large trees and in other parts of the southwest that agreement is yielding good restoration
7221630 but as if a century of mismanaging forests werent enough the coconino national forest now stands in the way of those forests restoration by insisting on logging big trees

7221634 im disgusted with myself for that thats my only regret in the whole competition the first round but i gave it everything i had in the last three
7221635 i had that in the back of my head but i didnt let it affect my game i just threw everything i had
7221636 he caught me with a couple of good shots i caught him body shots as well that probably didnt score
7221637 but im not going to start making excuses ive had a great campaign i want to thank all the supporters here and at home thats it thats the end of the fairytale for now
7221638 when i was growing up smoking was glamorous film stars would pose for the cameras with a cigarette in their hand
7221639 i remember buying a single cigarette from the shop for threepence then smoking it at a cafe hoping the boys would notice
7221640 i moved on to a pack of five then ten and when i started working it was 20 and i would smoke a pack a day i didnt realise it at the time but i was a pretty young woman
7221641 its only later when you look in a mirror at what is left and see a photo as you used to be that you realise how things have changed
7221642 i dont want anyone to suffer like i am it is unimaginable and the pain is so horrendous i have to take morphine every day

7221644 i know giving up smoking is a struggle but smokers dont see people in hospital hooked up to machines dying slow painful undignified deaths and they should
7221645 i hope my story can stop even one person smoking
7221646 i spoke to maureen a couple of months ago she was desperate to pass on her experience to try to prevent young people smoking
7221647 i hope her message lives on in some way it would be a fitting tribute
7221648 once we tell people they say thats neat or what a great idea
7221649 i think its a very creative way to try to make people aware and get people to talk about secondhand smoke
7221650 people are exposed to thousands of commercial messages and the challenge becomes how do you differentiate yourself and create a message that will break through the clutter
7221651 i think because of that youll start seeing more and more of that type of innovation in the marketplace advertising to create a buzz as opposed to the traditional on sale this week for 99 cents kind of thing
7221652 in 1990 on the occasion of van goghs centennial celebration 100 years since his death i dedicated 100 paintings entitled the
7221653 images of children under the age of 18 who are smoking tobacco is prohibited across all of yahoos properties
7221654 i thought it was an interesting take on the horrors of the terrible day
7221655 the same could happen to the human body too if subjected to the terrors of smoking
7221656 we got started way back in 1990 in the b c stop smoking program
7221657 we had very good evidence even then that we could double or triple the rate at which people stop smoking
7221658 if patients going for elective surgery have stopped smoking they cut down their use of intensive care their length of stay their likelihood of complications of surgical wounds and their cardiovascular complications
7221659 there is a lot of prejudice and a lot of lack of understanding around smoking its a dumb choice people deserve what they get they dont understand in fact that a lot of smoking is explained by the genetics of smokers the two major predictors of smoking are years of education and smoking behaviour of the biological parents
7221660 when i was hitchhiking i could go three days without food as long as i had cigarettes
7221661 very few people come from a smoking family and can walk away from it i was born addicted no doubt in my mind i had my first smoke when i was 11 and never stopped
7221662 i took my work boot off one day and two of my toes just split open you could see the bone you could see the meat i went to the doctors and they zipped them off the second foot was the same thing just like a sausage it was so full of gangrene
7221663 he quit for about six months that morning for whatever reason he went over the lake decided to light up had a seizure fell in the lake and drowned
7221664 why am i still here maybe ive got something to say and im saying it now
7221665 ive had people read the book right there in front of me and they had tears in their eyes and they ask me when is the good stuff going to happen
7221666 im not mad im not angry what i am is im pissed off at those government and media who can do something with the smoking issue and they wont do anything about it
7221667 this province has a long history of not doing preventive measures of using the health care system for only diseases and injuries and this is part of that tradition
7221668 i think that part of the resistance from government is the fact that they need to be very public in what they are delivering it doctor delivered prevention is very effective but it is very low key theres not going to be billboards about it theres not going to be television advertising about it
7221669 the irony is that the premiers office came out with the act now program citing these lofty goals of reducing tobacco usage and increasing physical activity and eating fruits and vegetables but how is this going to happen
7221670 i dont see a lot about how this is going to happen besides sending out nice advertising and telling people to do it eighty percent of the population goes to see their doctors every year it is one of the best places to do it prevention
7221671 its not uncommon for a patient to come in with six health problems but weve got one fee whether its one minor problem or six major problems so the fee structure is not well set up to help physicians spend the time they need to focus on their patients
7221672 ive often said that to take time out of your practice to plan proactively for care was simply a donation
7221673 you werent seeing patients then you werent being reimbursed frankly nobody valued that time your patients might appreciate it but it was not going to pay the bills it truly has not been valued by our health care system
7221674 the result was that very very quickly practices reorganized they hired additional staff identified the subpopulations within the practices and called them in for appropriate follow ups both for various disease conditions and risk conditions
7221675 practices that are allowed to operate on a population based funding model can do a lot more care over the phone they can delegate more care to nursing staff and others and focus more on managing their overall population and identify people that have fallen off and focus on getting them back into the practice and getting them assessed it opens up a range of possibilities which the fee for service system doesnt where the doctor has to see the patient eyeball to eyeball before they can be paid
7221676 there is a new and complex fee system that does provide for payment for some planning care that has just come into place in b c and we will have to see how that works
7221677 a population based funding model that still allows for some fee for service is probably the way to go
7221678 the fee for service does not work for complex patients basically the doctor is rewarded for doing the wrong thing
7221679 if the doctor does a good job they go broke
7221680 there has been a real push in the media to say we cant afford good health care so we have to settle for bad health care somehow that message just keeps being put out there and people are starting to believe that but its not true we need to make sure that the public doesnt buy that good health care can be afforded but there has to be the will to make that happen
7221681 theres interest by family doctors theres generations of literature dating back to the 60s and 70s and most recently the 2002 roy romanow report on the future of canadian health care stating that this is the way to go our governments just havent been able to get away from acute care to commit to this area i guess this is just not as sexy and it just doesnt get the headlines preventing diseases five or 10 years from now just doesnt have the same impact in the headlines as someone who cant get in the operating room yesterday
7221682 i think we have tended to emphasize the acute care side of the ledger previously in b c i think we are behind some jurisdictions particularly alberta and ontario but we are working hard to catch up i think we need to go there and we need to go there as quickly and effectively as we can
7221683 i have religion on primary health care and prevention i think those are the two lights at the ends of the tunnel that are not onrushing freight trains
7221684 if you have diabetes one of the best ways to prevent blindness is to have an annual checkup with an ophthalmologist this is the single most effective intervention that you can offer people with diabetes so they dont go blind
7221685 decreasing access to a lot of services that are properly defined as preventive health care so it is absolutely impossible to believe george abbott when he says that this government in victoria is supporting preventive health care theyre not

7221696 t he medina message is not the fundamental universal eternal message of islam that founding message is from mecca so the reformation of islam must be based on a return to the mecca message in order to reconcile the mecca and medina messages into a single system muslim jurists have said that some of the medina verses have abrogated the corresponding earlier verses from mecca although the abrogation did take place and it was logical and valid jurisprudence at one time it was a postponement not a permanent abrogation

7221745 t he medina message is not the fundamental universal eternal message of islam that founding message is from mecca so the reformation of islam must be based on a return to the mecca message in order to reconcile the mecca and medina messages into a single system muslim jurists have said that some of the medina verses have abrogated the corresponding earlier verses from mecca although the abrogation did take place and it was logical and valid jurisprudence at one time it was a postponement not a permanent abrogation
7221746 the mecca verses should now be made the basis of the law and the medina verses should be abrogated this counter abrogation will result in the total conciliation between islamic law and the modern development of human rights and civil liberties in this sense we reformers are superfundamentalists

7221785 whether in her own home or leading a meeting as chair of the sundance institute utah advisory board gayle had a personal style that was a combination of generosity grace femininity and perceptive intelligence
7221786 she never failed to bring her sense of fun and passion for the arts to all that she did within and for the community
7221787 but were just going to have to wait and see
7221788 especially a guy like osi he definitely means a lot to this team and franchise anytime a guy like that goes down it definitely hits you right in the throat
7221789 i just told him to keep his spirits up were praying for him and wish him the best
7221790 hes got 11 days to get better hes got 11 days to get back in the game hopefully hes back by the opener on sept 4
7221791 our d line we have a pretty close bond were like a band of brothers so first thing is i want osi to be ok
7221792 the second thing that was on my mind was its time to go dave
7221793 youre saying lost like hes gone but i dont think hes gone anywhere
7221794 the game is in 11 days after today we have 11 days to get better 11 days to get healthy hopefully he can get healthy in 11 days
7221795 it just seemed like he turned the corner and kind of took an awkward step
7221796 the turf is hard and playing at the speed and trying to turn that edge its easy to tweak something
7221797 we know we have the personnel to step up in his absence
7221798 obviously hes a pro bowler you cant replace someone like that without feeling it at least a little bit but we understand we do have enough people here to get the job done
7221799 thats the great thing about this team is i feel like they have some faith in me
7221800 those guys i go out there and its just like im in lets go osi he missed a couple of practices during training camp so theyre comfortable with me
7221801 it sure hasnt sunk in yet this was such a hard fought battle
7221802 i think when that kind of thing happens the guys got a good taste of whats important in life we were crushed by that
7221803 theyre always good theyre fast and theyre tough to beat
7221804 but the character of this group is so persevering they never looked out of the match theyre just grinding and grinding and grinding
7221805 anytime a guy like that goes down it definitely hits you right in the throat
7221806 its unreasonable for people to pay that kind of money
7221807 id be lying if i said i wasnt disappointed with the turnout but the intention remains the same
7221808 i want to be a voice so the jets and giants fans can speak as one
7221809 ive been a jets season ticket holder for over 40 years
7221810 but if the prices the giants are charging are the same for me im going to have to come up with 60 000 plus the price of tickets just to keep what i have now theyre basically going to price me out of the seats
7221811 you could spend that money on repairs for your house or build a fancy entertainment room and put a television in it and watch the games at home over the last 10 years the fans that come to games have become second class citizens
7221812 it feels good just to go out there and get this one under my belt was important
7221813 it feels good to have the support of the team and now we just go from here
7221814 i thought he did great i thought he threw the ball really well
7221815 i hope he can win some games for us and help us get to the playoffs because if he doesnt win any games were not going to be able to do it
7221816 remember its only one night we have to see first how he feels today but its very positive its important to have him back we could have an extra weapon the last month
7221817 what i liked most about it was he made the adjustments he adjusted to the hitters approach and i liked that
7221818 hes going to pitch for us again in the big leagues this year
7221819 weve envisioned him as a starter but youve got to see where the rehab goes
7221820 ive had really good players ive been very very fortunate
7221821 the first thing that comes to mind is smart and detailed
7221822 he has information for us every day its kind of impressive stuff that makes you go wow he knows exactly what he wants to convey to you and he does a good job of conveying that message
7221823 he does a great job of not only coaching the big picture but the little things
7221824 sometimes even a guy like myself an 11 year vet may not have thought about in a while and may not have been doing a hand placement or a foot placement hes very wise in the game
7221825 everybody has a draw scheme everybody has a trap everybody has a power everybody has a zone scheme how coaches put their spin on it and the techniques they use with it can be different
7221826 if you ask any of these linemen does brett favre work the pocket any differently theyre more focused on who they have to block
7221827 the guys up front that theyre blocking arent changing you still have to apply the technique thats not going to change
7221828 obviously theres a lot thats gone on the last four years
7221829 he wasnt the same as 2003 but it doesnt matter how hard you throw as long as you are around the zone
7221830 he can win in the big leagues with those pitches
7221831 he surprised me but now lets see him go out there in five days and do this again and then do it again five days after that
7221832 i thought for sure he was going to take me out
7221833 hixon has a big game and all of a sudden the other receivers get back to practice
7221834 any one of those guys could have been up for mvp of the super bowl they took over the game
7221835 i try to keep all the quarterbacks behind me healthy
7221836 he can win in the big leagues with those pitches
7221837 he surprised me but now lets see him go out there in five days and do this again and then do it again five days after that

7221859 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7221860 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7221861 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7221862 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7221863 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7221864 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class

7221884 the existence of an inner oort cloud has been theoretically predicted for many years but sq372 and perhaps sedna are the first objects we have found that seem to originate there its exciting that we are beginning to verify these predictions

7221888 there is concern at the very highest level that kate middleton still does not have a job one royal source told the newspaper
7221889 the queen is keen that the monarchy should lead by example and that the princes and their girlfriends should all be seen to be hard workers
7221890 the queen has made it known that she feels kate should get involved with a charity possibly an animal charity where she can be seen to be doing something proactive and something entirely safe
7221891 it is important that kate isnt seen to be doing anything controversial and she needs to do something completely different from any of the charity work that diana did
7221892 she has quite a bad reputation for being rude when it comes to responding to letters one friend told the newspaper
7221893 she often fails to rsvp when she is asked to attend events she once failed to reply to a wedding invitation from one of williams friends and it didnt go down very well

7221901 i also believe there is one more group of poker machine addicts and that group is you the manufacturers the owners the operators he said

7221915 the serious problems in life however are never fully solved the meaning and purpose of a problem seem to lie not in its solution but in our working at it incessantly
7221916 you know how everyone says celebrities look good in photos because theyre airbrushed well its true and now the rich and famous arent the only ones who can get photo retouching a new site just launched that takes any photo you have and makes you and your friends look better and it doesnt even cost that much money its called picwash and dont get all worried like i did that picwash will turn you into an airbrushed robot that looks nothing like you they just do the basic stuff that makes you a more beautiful you mattify your shiny skin fix red eyes take away pimples and stray hairs etc and i met with the owner last week and he told me actual humans do the retouching and you can even send your retoucher a note with what to fix if you arent happy with the results pretty cool huh

7221949 your machines are inherently unsafe he told attendees in sydney today
7221950 when other products have been found to cause significant harm to a significant number of users they have been banned
7221951 the people who make your industry so wealthy are so addicted to your product that they will jeopardise their own financial well being and the well being of their families he said
7221952 they will steal from their partners their bosses and their children just to churn money through your machines
7221953 you call it entertainment or gaming i call it obscene
7221954 sickened during the mid 1990s when working as a lawyer he would see people lose their personal injury payouts to poker machines including an intellectually impaired man who lost almost 30 000
7221955 addicted and reluctant to wind back poker machine numbers because every year they reaped almost 4 billion in gaming taxes he said
7221956 i also believe there is one more group of poker machine addicts and that group is you the manufacturers the owners the operators he said
7221957 i am not willing to accept that you dont see the harm that you do
7221958 you do yet you choose to do it anyway and that may be the saddest part of this sad sad situation
7221959 agree with pretty much all of what senator xenophon just said im not offended and we need to have this debate
7221960 i know that clubs have done an enormous amount in the last 10 years and theres more to do mr newell said
7221961 youve got ipart who are beholden to nobody theyve said that clubs cant survive mr newell said
7221962 the images were taken around noon time on may 29 1997 in aston pennsylvania i took this photo off my large screen tv i played my video and took some digital photos from it
7221963 security has been tightened in and around tatas small car project more than 4 000 policemen have been deployed

7221965 ive been playing very nicely since coming back to utah
7221966 my swing was off a little bit friday but saturday my pace of swing was much better the ball was curving just right i stayed in the fairways which were crucial and i only missed one fairway all day
7221967 itll be really fun to be out there with those younger guys
7221968 i think a lot of the guys will come out like young lions sunday
7221969 it is pivotal he has to be in the parliament because it will change the dynamics a victory will be a step in the process
7221970 people want anwar to be in parliament and then become the prime minister
7221971 it does not matter to me whether he wins or loses as far as i am concerned i have my government to look after whatever the opposition members want to do that is up to them
7221972 the interplay of politics and religion has never been more in play than here in
7221973 it the sodomy charge has moved to centre stage now that the campaign is moving to its grand finale
7221974 hes so fast hes literally invisible to american viewers until 13 hours after he finishes
7221975 we have the best coffee on the planet we have bob marley and now we have usain bolt we are overjoyed and overwhelmed
7221976 swimming has their lzr suits and their deeper pools we have a 6 foot 5 inch guy thats running 9 6s and beating the rest of the olympic field by two tenths of a second hes our new technology
7221977 whats chad going to do run next to the pool he still might get beat
7221978 if only there was snooker darts and a dog show
7221979 what is so modern about sword fighting and target practice
7221980 by anyones reckoning these olympics have been a disaster for australia
7221981 most galling of all has been our complete and unmitigated failure in the equestrian competition if theres one olympic sport that captures the spirit of open minded egalitarian australia its dressage a competition in which pampered tights wearing nobodies get to dress up in tails and sit down for a few minutes to boss around their horses if the government has any sense it will make investment in this most watchable of sports a first order priority for the next 12 months
7221982 but if you stop being physical you stop giving yourself a chance to play because it is going to be a physical game i can call tennessee coach phil fulmer and ask if we could just play touch i dont think hell go for it
7221983 its like someone missing a free throw at the nba finals or not catching the touchdown at the super bowl
7221984 sometimes things happen batons slip they got it done tonight in the 4x4 and thats the impression they want to leave with the united states
7221985 just because a lot of us were favored and came up short at least we still pulled it off and got medals
7221986 this is the olympic games people pull out great performances all the time im really proud of the team and im happy we ended on such a high note
7221987 we couldnt run the ball on them we were outmanned
7221988 this program is at the level we should have that in our sights every year
7221989 its my main responsibility as a head football coach to make sure the team is ready to play each and every week
7221990 hes continually adjusting his ideas and views throughout the program and developing it
7221991 he is a smart guy kids change and times change and people who are successful adjust to that
7221992 he has become more comfortable as a head coach and more understanding of us
7221993 a three year absence it has been too long this program is at the level we should have that in our sights every year
7221994 for a while i was saying that our team was really figuring out how to play on the road but after these last two road games it is hard to feel that just because of the number of chances were giving away
7221995 its not even the number of goals were allowing though the game tonight probably could have been six or seven it seems like weve got to take a few steps back here and figure things out quickly defensively
7221996 its just such an accomplishment for this team and the usa and these girls
7221997 theres no disappointment if we would have come out today and not fought id maybe have a different answer to that
7221998 i cant explain to you where our team was several months ago and where we are now from inside out how weve grown how weve played for each other
7221999 as the tournament went on the more i believed in us and where we could go and what we could do thats a tribute to all the girls

7222021 im excited to see this team play its the best energy weve ever had we understand what we want to accomplish we just have to prove it
7222022 thats just typical adam timo it was great to see him have such a big game because it benefits our program
7222023 we feel bad for him because this is his senior season and hes a huge part of our team its a good thing that this isnt season ending ill take him for five games rather than for nothing at all
7222024 like going 100 miles an hour down the freeway only the freeway youre driving on is covered with ice there is a lot of slipping and sliding and moving around
7222025 when those chutes open its like hitting a brick wall with your car at 30 miles an hour so it gets your attention but its a good feeling too because you know youre slowing down
7222026 its a real busy 90 seconds when youre in these cars
7222027 there is not a lot of time to look around and enjoy the scenery there is an awful lot going you really have to concentrate
7222028 i probably enjoyed the designing fabrication and building of the car more than actually racing out here
7222029 my dad and i we have such a good time in the shop building all this stuff and working on it
7222030 racing is kind of the necessary evil of building them because you cant find a customer who will come into the shop buy one of these things and bring it out here and race it so you have to do it all
7222031 we were still on the access road we hadnt gotten back to i 80 yet and we started talking about what we wanted to do next
7222032 we asked each other do we want to put more power into this car and go a little faster or do we want to step up
7222033 itd be nice to get a championship ring on top of this
7222034 weve got a great squad back in salt lake and weve got a great chance of winning that thing
7222035 its an unbelievable experience ups downs ill remember it for the rest of my life
7222036 gold silver bronze it doesnt matter the experience was well worth it and it feels good to be taking home a medal
7222037 this has been a great tournament i dont think anyone expected to have as stiff competition as it was

7222082 there is concern at the very highest level that kate middleton still does not have a job one royal source told the newspaper
7222083 the queen is keen that the monarchy should lead by example and that the princes and their girlfriends should all be seen to be hard workers
7222084 the queen has made it known that she feels kate should get involved with a charity possibly an animal charity where she can be seen to be doing something proactive and something entirely safe
7222085 it is important that kate isnt seen to be doing anything controversial and she needs to do something completely different from any of the charity work that diana did
7222086 she has quite a bad reputation for being rude when it comes to responding to letters one friend told the newspaper
7222087 she often fails to rsvp when she is asked to attend events she once failed to reply to a wedding invitation from one of williams friends and it didnt go down very well

7222149 we moeten ergens naar streven wat we hooguit met onze vingertoppen kunnen raken dat het haalbaar is dat hebben we hier wel laten zien
7222150 er komt steeds meer tegenstand in de arena wij zullen nog intensiever aan talentontwikkeling moeten doen
7222151 wat ik heb gemerkt is dat de overheid het belang van topsport steeds meer is gaan inzien het gevolg daarvan is dat men ook bereid is meer te investeren het budget bepaalt niet rechtstreeks het resultaat maar om beter te worden heb je wel geld nodig
7222152 ik kan niet anders dan concluderen dat dan dit op toeval berust wel is het zo dat het bij de vrouwen iets minder tijd kost om tot de wereldtop door te dringen domweg omdat er internationaal minder vrouwen sporten dan mannen
7222153 ik geloof het niet zo maar laten we de evaluatie afwachten vooralsnog gaan de conclusies in die richting mij te ver

7222158 de laatste jaren werd het nodige in beslag genomen de vraag van de horecaondernemers was dan altijd wat te doen met de voorwerpen
7222159 ze hebben de voorwerpen als een stanleymes of een schroevendraaier vaak bij zich om zichzelf te verdedigen bij de deur van de discotheek wordt het ingenomen
7222160 soms vragen we ons ook af bij tasjes van vrouwen waarom zit dat er in
7222161 bijvoorbeeld een schaar die net iets te groot is en zo ook als steekwapen gebruikt kan worden
7222162 dat soort dingen hoor je niet bij je te hebben als je gaat stappen

7222167 people want anwar to be in parliament and then become the prime minister

7222182 meest mooie momenten het weekend met mijn vriendin iris in stavanger de dagen bij marie en ron in grinde eiland gullen het passeren van de poolcirkel de lofoten de vester len en het eiland senja de dagen bij lalia en j nos in russeluft a little outside of alta het bereiken van de noordkaap en uiteindelijk stockholm en het wederzien met mijn dochters merel en lobke op luchthaven weeze
7222183 meest vervelende momenten het ter ziele gaan van een velg 16 kilometer voor kog het moeten achterlaten van onder andere mijn vouwstoeltje mijn thermoskan en mijn cafeti re belangrijke gewichtsbesparing de beklimming van de sognefjellveg met name omdat ik niet wist waar ik aan begon het nachtje andenes mistig koud en onvriendelijk en de monsterrit naar alta 243 knuppelharde kilometers
7222184 lichamelijk leed protesterende zitbeentjes nieuw brooks zadel na zon 1500 had het zadel zich uiteindelijk aan mijn zitvlak aangepast pijnlijke knie n ontstoken slijmbeurzen door de voor mij onbekende geometrie van de nieuwe fiets heel wat dagen met pijnstillers gefietst stijve en pijnlijke onderrug al jaren een probleem elke morgen stretchoefeningen en een goede fysiotherapeut in alta hielp

7222197 almost without exception i find these defendants to be honestly amazed at the seriousness of their conduct as far as the system is concerned
7222198 many of the defendants have no previous criminal history and have been productive members of the community and often there are complex psychological reasons why they are interested in child pornography
7222199 the images themselves are truly horrible even passive viewers of such material help to make its production profitable
7222200 the practical effect of possessing child pornography is to stimulate the market in child pornography which encourages things such as child torture and rape
7222201 and i didnt look at them or dwell on them very much

7222214 what takes precedence when how i hope i never have to make a decision about killing innocent people but i know thats a real part of what it takes the people who make the decisions about who lives and dies usually arent the ones with their lives at stake theyre in a room somewhere moving the pieces around

7222380 sesungguhnya ada suatu kaum yang ketika dikeluarkan dari neraka dalam keadaan hanya terbakar sedikit saja pada bagian wajah mereka lalu mereka masuk surga
7222381 pada hari kiamat nanti sesungguhnya syafaat juga akan diberikan kepada orang orang dari umatku yang melakukan dosa dosa besar lalu mati sebelum bertobat mereka berada di pintu pertama neraka jahanam wajah mereka tidak hitam mata mereka tidak biru mereka tidak dibelenggu dengan belenggu belenggu mereka tidak berkawan dengan para setan mereka tidak dipukul dengan godam dan tidak dilemparkan ke dasar neraka di anatara mereka ada yang tinggal di dalamnya hanya satu jam kemudian keluar di anatara mereka ada yang tinggal di dalamnya selama sehari kemudian keluar di anatara mereka ada yang tinggal di dalamnya selama sebulan kemudian keluar di anatara mereka ada yang tinggal di dalamnya selama setahun kemudian keluar di anatara mereka ada yang tinggal di dalam neraka adalah seperti dunia sejak diciptakan sampai hari kefanaannya yaitu selama tujuh ribu tahun

7222394 untungnya pasien ini hanya mengalami serangan insemik berkala atau terjadi penghentian suplai darah menuju otak yang kurang dari 24 jam
7222395 namun kejadian ini menunjukkan kepada kita bahwa aktivitas setiap hari yang melibatkan penyimpangan agak lama di bagian leher seperti menggunakan telepon dengan menghimpit antara telinga dan pundak bisa menimbulkan masalah yang tidak terduga bagi sebagian orang
7222396 lebih baik mencegah sebelum hal itu terjadi pada kita semua

7222400 buah delima yang hanya sebiji ini sengaja aku beli untuk istriku kalau
7222401 kenapa kamu sedih demi allah yang maha perkasa dan maha agung ketika engkau memberikan buah delima kepada orang tua itu maka puaslah hatiku dan lenyaplah keinginanku pada buah delima itu
7222402 wahai ali demi allah sandiwaraku ini hanya sekadar menguji sejauh mana keyakinanmu terhadap firman allah yang engkau bacakan tadi

7222404 kde like many other open source projects doesnt really need users at all
7222405 regardless of the fact the software project hes working on is by nature designed to be available to anyone anytime anywhere at no cost he dont really want you to use it unless you plan to help further its goals
7222406 hey if you want to hang with us you have to be as cool as us
7222407 an open source project without users is like a band without an audience a restaurant with no customers or a writer with no readers

7222409 theyre the only ones who give you the unbiased news
7222410 ya rasulullah adakah seseorang itu memaki maki kedua orang tuanya sendiri
7222411 ya iaitu apabila seseorang itu memaki maki ayah seseorang lalu orang yang dimaki maki ayahnya itu lalu memaki maki ayahnya sendiri atau seseorang itu memaki maki ibu orang lain lalu orang yang dimaki maki ibunya ini memaki maki ibunya sendiri
7222412 hai sandal jepit sial sekali nasib kamu diciptakan sekali saja dalam bentuk buruk dan tidak menarik
7222413 apa menariknya menjadi sandal jepit tidak ada kebanggaan bagi para pemakainya tidak pernah mendapatkan tempat penyimpanan yang istimewa dan tidak pernah disesali pada saat hilang kasihan sekali kamu
7222414 wahai sepatu yang terhormat mungkin semua orang akan memiliki kebanggaan jika memakai sepatu yang indah dan mewah sepertimu mereka akan menyimpannya di tempat yang terjaga membersihkannya meskipun masih bersih bahkan sekali sekali memamerkan kepada sanak keluarga maupun tetangga yang berkunjung ke rumahnya
7222415 tetapi sepatu yang terhormat kamu hanya menemaninya di didalam kesemuan pergi ke kantor maupun ke undangan undangan pesta untuk sekedar sebuah kebanggaan kamu hanya dipakai sesekali saja bedakan dengan aku aku siap menemani kemana saja pemakaiku pergi bahkan aku sangat loyal meski dipakai ke toilet ataupun kamar mandi aku memunculkan kerinduan bagi pemakaiku setelah dia seharian dalam cengkeraman keindahanmu maka manusia akan segera merindukanku karena apa wahai sepatu karena aku memunculkan kenyamanan dan kelonggaran aku tidak membutuhkan perhatian dan perawatan yang spesial dalam kamus kehidupanku jika kita ingin membuat orang bahagia maka kita harus menciptakan kenyamanan untuknya
7222416 sepatu sahabatku yang terhormat untuk apa kehebatan kalau sekedar untuk dipamerkan dan menimbulkan efek ketakutan untuk kehilangan untuk apa kepandaian dikeluarkan hanya untuk sekedar mendapatkan kekaguman
7222417 sahabatku ditengah kekaguman sesungguhnya kita sedang menciptakan tembok pembeda yang tebal semakin kita ingin dikagumi maka sesungguhnya kita sedang membangun temboknya
7222418 lihat sahabatku bahkan untuk berbuat kebaikanpun manusia mengajakku dan meninggalkanmu
7222419 terima kasih engkau telah memberikan pelajaran yang berharga sahabatku sandal jepit yang terhormat

7222424 sesungguhnya orang orang kafir terhadap ayat ayat kami kelak akan kami masukkan mereka ke dalam neraka setiap kali kulitmereka terbakar hangus kami ganti kulit mereka dengan kulit yanglain agar mereka merasakan pedihnya azab sesungguhnya allah mahaperkasa lagi maha bijaksana
7222425 ladies and gentlemen i really want to encourage you to wash up
7222426 remember the giraffes taking food out of your hand with their tongues theyre also long enough to reach into their noses which they do with alarming frequency in other words if you thought they were drooling on you it was actually snot
7222427 do you remember to wash your hands i didnt hear the sink
7222428 well too bad for you the germs will kill you not me

7222430 ohhhhh so you must be like you know smart and stuff ed uh no you must know all about this internet stuff then thats why you knew how to try all that stuff with the modem
7222431 no actually i knew to try those things because in the five years ive had your service it sucks so bad that ive learned all this crap along the way from the two hundred technicians ive met from your company
7222432 youre smart maybe we should hire you to run our tech calls
7222433 orang kuat itu bukanlah yang menang dalam gulat tetapi orang kuat adalah yang mampu menahan nafsu amarahnya
7222434 siapa yang dikatakan paling kuat diantara kalian shahabat menjawab yaitu diantara kami yang paling kuat gulatnya beliau bersabda bukan begitu tetapi dia adalah yang paling kuat mengendalikan nafsunya ketika marah
7222435 barangsiapa yang mampu menahan marahnya padahal dia mampu menyalurkannya maka allah menyeru pada hari kiamat dari atas khalayak makhluk sampai disuruh memilih bidadari mana yang mereka mau
7222436 tidaklah hamba meneguk tegukan yang lebih utama di sisi allah subhanahu wa taala dari meneguk kemarahan karena mengharap wajah allah subhanahu wa taala
7222437 tidaklah seorang hamba menahan kemarahan karena allah subhanahu wa taala kecuali allah subhanahu wa taala akan memenuhi baginya keamanan dan keimanan
7222438 dari abu hurairah radliyallahu anhu bahwa seseorang berkata kepada nabi shalallahu alaihi wasallam berwasiatlah kepadaku beliau bersabda jangan menjadi seorang pemarah kemudian diulang ulang beberapa kali dan beliau bersabda janganlah menjadi orang pemarah
7222439 aku berkata ya rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wasallam berwasiatlah kepadaku beliau bersabda jangan menjadi pemarah maka berkata seseorang maka aku pikirkan apa yang beliau sabdakan ternyata pada sifat pemarah itu terkumpul seluruh kejelekan
7222440 ada dua orang saling mencela di sisi nabi shalallahu alaihi wasallam dan kami sedang duduk di samping nabi shalallahu alaihi wasallam salah satu dari keduanya mencela lawannya dengan penuh kemarahan sampai memerah wajahnya maka nabi shalallahu alaihi wasallam bersabda sesungguhnya aku akan ajarkan suatu kalimat yang kalau diucapkan akan hilang apa yang ada padanya yaitu sekiranya dia mengucapkan audzubillahi minasy syaithani rrajiim maka mereka berkata kepada yang marah tadi tidakkah kalian dengar apa yang disabdakan nabi dia menjawab aku ini bukan orang gila
7222441 apabila salah seorang diantara kalian marah dalam keadaan berdiri duduklah jika belum hilang maka berbaringlah
7222442 sesungguhnya marah itu dari syaithan dan syaithan itu dicipta dari api dan api itu diredam dengan air maka apabila diantara kalian marah berwudlulah
7222443 empat hal barangsiapa yang mampu mengedalikannya maka allah akan menjaga dari syetan dan diharomkan dari neraka yaitu seseorang mampu menguasai nafsunya ketika berkeinginan cemas syahwat dan marah
7222444 sesungguhnya orang yang paling keras siksaannya pada hari kiamat adalah orang membuat gambar seperti gambar ini
7222445 anas membantu rumah tangga rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wasallam selama 10 tahun maka tidak pernah beliau berkata kepada anas
7222446 ya allah aku memohon kepada mu berbicara yang benar ketika marah dan ridha
7222447 tiga hal termasuk akhlak keimanan yaitu orang yang jika marah kemarahannya tidak memasukkan ke dalam perkara batil jika senang maka kesenangannya tidak mengeluarkan dari kebenaran dan jika dia mampu dia tidak melakukan yang tidak semestinya
7222448 bukanlah puasa itu sekedar menahan makan dan minum sesungguhnya puasa itu adalah puasa dari perbuatan keji dan sia sia apabila ada orang yang mencelamu atau membodohimu maka katakanlah sesungguhnya aku sedang berpuasa sesungguhnya aku sedang berpuasa
7222449 ya muhammad allah azza wa jalla mengucapkan salam kepadamu dan berpesan kepadamu kalau orangtua itu datang engkau harus menanyakan apa apa yang dikatakan dalam hatinya dan tidak didengarkan oleh teliganya
7222450 tanyakan saja kepadanya ya rasulullah bukankah saya menafkahkan uang itu untuk beberapa orang ammati saudara ayahnya atau khalati saudara ibu nya atau untuk keperluan saya sendiri
7222451 lupakanlah hal itu sekarang ceritakanlah kepadaku apa yang engkau katakan di dalam hatimu dan tak pernah didengar oleh telingamu
7222452 demi allah ya rasulullah dengan ini allah swt berkenan menambah kuat keimananku dengan ke rasul anmu memang saya pernah menangisi nasib malangku dan kedua telingaku tak pernah mendengarnya
7222453 saya mengatakan kepadanya kata kata ini aku mengasuhmu sejak bayi dan memeliharamu waktu muda
7222454 pada saat itu nabi langsung memegangi ujung baju pada leher anak itu seraya berkata
7222455 ya rasulullah siapa yang paling berhak memperoleh pelayanan dan persahabatanku
7222456 ibumu ibumu ibumu kemudian ayahmu dan kemudian yang lebih dekat kepadamu dan yang lebih dekat kepadamu
7222457 bagaimana mungkin seorang yang mencaci maki ayah dan ibunya sendiri
7222458 dia mencaci maki ayah orang lain lalu orang itu membalas mencaci maki ayahnya dan dia mencaci maki ibu orang lain lalu orang lain itupun membalas mencaci maki ibunya mutafaqalaih
7222459 memberinya nama yang baik mendidik adab yang baik dan memberinya kedudukan yang baik dalam hatirnu
7222460 ya robbi aku telah diputus hubungan kekeluargaanku aku telah diperlakukan dengan buruk oleh keluarga dekatku ya robbi aku telah dizalimi mereka ya robbi ya robbi
7222461 tidakkah kamu ridha aku menyambung hubunganku dengan orang yang menghubungimu dan aku putus hubunganku dengan orang yang memutus hubungannya dengan kamu hr bukhari
7222462 di sini kita pernah bertemu mencari warna seindah pelangi ketika kau mengulurkan tanganmu membawaku ke daerah yang baru hidupku kini ceria
7222463 pertemuan kita disuatu hari menitikan ukhuwah yang sejati bersyukur kehadirat ilahi diatas jalinan yang suci
7222464 mengapakah kita di temukan dan akhirnya di pisahkan mungkinkah menguji kesetiaan kejujuran dan kemanisan iman tuhan berikan daku kekuatan
7222465 ya allah jika sahabatku ini adalah jodoh hamb segerakan pernikahan hamba dengannya dan permudah urusan pernikahan itu tetapi jika bukan jodoh hamba ya allah bawalah hamba pergi jauh dari kota ini
7222466 namun kini perpisahan yang terjadi dugaan yang menimpa diri bersamalah diatas suratan kutetap pergi jua
7222467 kini dengarkanlah dendangan lagu tanda ingatanku kepadamu teman agar ikatan ukhuwah kan bersimpul padu kenangan bersamamu tak akan kulupa walau badai melanda walau bercerai jasad dan nyawa
7222468 lalu bagaimana dengan harapan perempuan terhadap sahabat laki lakinya ini
7222469 abang sungguh adek berharap bisa menjadi bidadari yang mendampingi hidup abang apapun adanya abang
7222470 sahabatku jangan kau nanti lagi kehadiranku bukan berarti aku tidak mencintaimu sungguh aku sangat mencintaimu walaupun tidak pernah ku ungkapkan langsung padamu biarkanlah allah menjalankan skenarionya dan kita hanya menjalankan skenario dari nya itu maafkan aku yang mungkin telah membuat dirimu menaruh harap walau tidak pernah terucap dibibirku karena kau memang sahabat sejatiku teman berbagi cerita selamat berpisah doakan aku sahabat agar tetap istiqomah di jalan nya dan aku akan selalu mengenangmu
7222471 jikapun suatu saat nanti ternyata kita tetap di pertemukan dalam cinta kasih yang suci jangan dipikirkan semua itu semuanya hak allah biarkan dia saja yang mengaturnya jangan kau tutup pintu hati untuk yang lain terima pinangan lelaki yang shalih dan jangan sekali kali kau menolaknya karena kau akan mendapat fitnah karenanya demikian sebagaimana yang dikatakan nabi 14 abad yang lalu jangan mengorbankan diri pada hal yang sia sia sahabatku
7222472 mungkinkah telah terlupa tuhan ada janjinya bertemu dan perisah adalah matan kasihnya andai ini ujian terangilah tambah kesabaran pergilah jelita hadirlah cahaya
7222473 teman betapa pilunya hati ini menghadapi perpisahan ini pahit manis perjuangan telah kita rasa bersama semoga allah meridhai persahabatan dan perpisahan ini teruskan perjuangan
7222474 kan kuutus salam ingatanku dalam doa kudusku sepanjang waktu ya allah bntulah hambamu snyuman yang tersirat dibibirmu menjadi ingatan setiap waktu tanda kemesraan yang bersimpul padu kenangku di dalam doamu semoga allah berkatimu
7222475 sebuah oretan hati buat mereka yang pernah mengalami hal yang sama semoga tulisan ini menjadi pengingat kita terkadang persahabatan yang tidak di landasi syariat akan berbuah hubungan yang tidak di halalkan oleh syariat buat seorang sahabat yang pernah menjadi partner sejati dalam perjuangan dakwahku selama di kalimantan teruskan perjuangan jangan mengeluh dan temukan lagi sahabat baru yang lebih hebat semoga sebuah tulisan
7222476 aku minta izin kepada nabi muhammad saw untuk melaksanakan umrah lalu rasulullah saw mengizinkanku
7222477 tidak seorang hamba mukmin yang berdoa untuk saudaranya dari kejauhan malainkan malaikat berkata dan bagimu seperti itu
7222478 janganlah kamu meremehkan kebaikan apapun walaupun sekadar bertemu saudaramu dengan wajah ceria
7222479 tidak ada dua orang muslim yang berjumpa lalu berjabat tangan melainkan keduanya diampuni dosanya sebelum berpisah
7222480 allah swt berfirman pasti akan mendapat cinta ku orang orang yang mencintai karena aku keduanya saling berkunjung karena aku dan saling memberli karena aku
7222481 barangsiapa bertemu saudaranya dengan membawa sesuatu yang dapat menggembirakannya pasti allah akan menggembirakannya pada hari kiamat
7222482 hendaklah kamu saling memberi hadiah karena hadiah itu dapat mewariskan rasa cinta dan menghilangkan kekotoran hati
7222483 biasakanlah kamu saling memberi hadiah niscaya kamu akan saling mencintai
7222484 siapa yang melepaskan kesusahan seorang mukmin di dunia niscaya allah akan melepaskan kesusahannya di akhirat siapa yang memudahkan orang yang kesusahan niscaya allah akan memudahkan urusannya di dunia dan di akhirat siapa yang menutupi aib seorang muslim niscaya allah akan menutupi aibnya di dunia dan di akhirat dan allah selalu menolong hamba nya jika hamba tersebut menolong saudaranya
7222485 if i cant get some from these prude straight chicks maybe its time to try a little something different something i have been fantasizing about for so long
7222486 i want to get drug tested over and over again
7222487 obviously its inconvenient but i tell you what its inconvenient if people affect you by cheating
7222488 i think about the 99 9 per cent of athletes that are clean so we have to make sure that we keep the playing field level im very happy with the many tests that were taken before and during the games
7222489 we are telling the cheats there wont be a possibility to cheat anymore
7222490 its probably not going to be as spectacular of a game at this time of day
7222491 im guessing most players didnt play to their level because of the heat
7222492 our team has worked so hard preparing for these games and to get this result here tells us that were finally there being one step up in ranking and beating the americans proves to us that our country has greatly improved
7222493 we have been aiming for this since 2001 and for many girls on this team this is their gold medal
7222494 it said youre not planting on this throw and i couldnt hold it it sucks but theres not much i can do about it now
7222495 if you look out on the field theres more taped up joints were all duct taped together i think an american thrower said in an interview its a train wreck that gets to happen six times over again
7222496 its not an easy sport and if you ever get a chance to experience running full speed and stopping on a straight left leg youll know what i mean its a tough event
7222497 ive had a chipped piece of cartilage i had my meniscus repaired in the fall i strained my patella tendon on my left leg theres just a number of things
7222498 but none of them are excuses i really stayed positive through all of them
7222499 i was trying not to let anything that could be negative take over and not let me be here and be competitive
7222500 it paid off i made the finals i didnt make the top eight which was my goal but i was damn close
7222501 di saat terjadinya jihad mereka sebaiknya meninggalkan kapal kapal sekutu agar tidak menodai perjuangan
7222502 saat kami tanya mengapa berjalan kaki sejauh itu mereka menjawab bahwa mereka menerima fatwa yang dibawa teman teman mereka dari indonesia fatwa itu menyatakan haram hukumnya bekerja dengan orang kafir yang memerangi kaum muslimin
7222503 jika inggris membantu belanda untuk kembali ke indonesia maka inggris akan menuai kemarahan dunia islam di timur tengah
7222504 kebangkitan islam di negeri muslim terbesar di dunia seperti di indonesia akan menginspirasikan negeri negeri islam lainnya untuk membebaskan diri dari eropa
7222505 mengapa kamu masih saja bersikap diplomatis terhadap seseorang yang ingin menghancurkan negeri kamu
7222506 yes indeed four years ago i respectfully urged the government to increase its effort
7222507 i think this scheme of own the podium program is a very good one for obvious reasons there is a bigger drive for winter sports than summer sports in canada
7222508 i think i should commend the government for what it has done but also the regional governments many provinces have been supportive
7222509 is this enough its up to the canadians to tell not for me im happy to see there has been a positive change but youll have to quantify it yourself i dont believe it will be short term i really believe its going to be in the long term
7222510 i take it with a big smile i was giving him what i think is fatherly advice and i stand by it hes a 22 year old and its time to mature and show respect for his opponents
7222511 we asked the international gymnastics federation to open up an inquiry themselves
7222512 eligibility of the athletes is the responsibility of the international federations not the ioc but of course we consider this as being a very serious issue
7222513 it seems to be okay however they want to examine this thoroughly they will report to us as soon as possible
7222514 if we dont carry on from what weve accomplished here and we dont build on this in the future we will have done a disservice to the olympians of the future
7222515 all the good ideas in the world dont mean anything if you dont have the raw material there to get to the top
7222516 thirty five per cent of the population of this country resides in southern ontario within a couple of hundred miles of the toronto region
7222517 winning the pan american games bid were embarking on now is exceedingly important
7222518 all information is in chinese and the federation is making as thorough analysis as possible of the papers
7222519 this process may take some time but in due course the fig will make a full report of our findings to the international olympic committee
7222520 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
7222521 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
7222522 i enjoyed the whole process it was a good time
7222523 it was special to compete in that kind of field with that kind of class and that kind of depth it was sensational for me
7222524 i dont have any excuses i got fourth i mean those guys beat me they ran good i ran an okay race i came fourth i have to be happy with the whole process fourth at the olympics
7222525 i was a little bit shocked that i wasnt moving as fluid as i wanted to be moving
7222526 i tried to stay in it more and it just didnt turn out for me im just physically exhausted mentally exhausted
7222527 so strict so disciplined for so long its the nerves and stress and everything it tends to break you down after a while
7222528 it was a tough race i got in a little bit of trouble in the corner coming home and those guys were gone and i just couldnt make up the ground it was too late
7222529 it was too wide to go outside and i was stuck inside and couldnt make my move
7222530 i dont know if i would have caught them anyway
7222531 initially in warmup i felt pretty decent when i got out there my body was just a little bit tired thats life thats the 800 fourth at the olympics still aint bad
7222532 this is the best olympics since 1996 obviously although in 96 only the medals were successful the depth of the team percentage wise was a lot lower
7222533 it was a fantastic day for me i was so happy to achieve this performance its not easy to achieve double gold in the olympics
7222534 this is a silver maybe in 2012 it will be a gold slowly slowly
7222535 there were many good competitors in the race but especially bekele
7222536 there is a big gap between us but we think we will train harder and we can narrow the gap one day
7222537 before the final i felt good but didnt know i could jump 2 05
7222538 my coach kept telling me i was in good shape and could jump a national record hes always right
7222539 i have a big heart from both a literal and figurative perspective
7222540 i have always since the very beginning worried about how hell cope with not winning because he just does the winning part so well
7222541 he learned very early how to win gracefully and i was always very proud of that he is dealing with not being no 1 as gracefully as he did winning im proud of him still its a new thing he learned
7222542 its hard to see him down on himself like that it hard to hear him apologizing for everything because really he has nothing to apologize for hes always such a confident person i didnt struggle so much with it but i just knew that he would bounce back because he always does hes a strong person
7222543 i mean as a young man of 22 to basically instantly recognize that he has a moment that he can do some good or help people and recognize he had a responsibility to give back to the paddling community and the people that supported him and canada as well i was very impressed that he just caught on to that immediately
7222544 its funny i always tell him that hes too stressed out and that he just needs to take a break
7222545 but were two completely different people he thrives on the drive and constantly going i like to sit back and relax everytime i can
7222546 we just got a property up in algonquin and hopefully that will be a nice place for us to relax he can sit down and sit on the dock and watch the sunrise and sunset
7222547 we couldnt run the ball on them we were outmanned
7222548 it breaks the mind barrier to know the chinese are beatable
7222549 its like the four minute mile once one person did it lots of people did it afterward its nice to know people are catching up
7222550 its absolutely surreal i never thought this would be possible i wasnt even really sure of my medal chances at all after i did my last dive and saw i was in first im like thats it its a silver medal im so happy with this and then i cant believe it
7222551 i knew it was a far chance but i did absolutely everything i could to give myself the best chance of doing it
7222552 this has been an unprecedented opportunity for western australia and they have wasted it
7222553 many western australians have missed out on the benefits of the economic boom many families are finding it tougher to make ends meet
7222554 a previous liberal government introduced a kindergarten program for every four year old and a pre primary program for every five year old
7222555 there are now 14 000 less students in our system than there were in 2001
7222556 for the first time in our states history our government school system has actually declined under labor
7222557 they have damaged the reputation of this great state both nationally and internationally
7222558 when colin barnett was education minister in 2000 the offer he put to the teaching workforce was 10 per cent over three years
7222559 one of the reasons why its possible the reserve bank may reduce interest rates in a week or two is because the budget is very strong because the surplus is very substantial
7222560 its slowing somewhat but the reserve bank is still predicting economic growth to be in the order of two per cent
7222561 the overall employment figures are still very robust and we anticipate that they will continue to be in good shape
7222562 its very wrong to draw wider conclusions from these things what youve got to look at is all the economic data and that suggests the economy is still in reasonably good shape
7222563 we need to hear from mr rudd how he will address the current slowdown without rudd speak and without a commitment to simply watch
7222564 now that unemployment inflation and growth are all worsening it is time for mr rudd to set out how he will deal with these problems
7222565 the end result if they succeed will be that it will be harder for the reserve bank to cut interest rates
7222566 mr wayne swan and mr tanner are kidding themselves if they think they are responsible for any downwards movements in interest rates
7222567 they really need to show some economic sense and some understanding of how this economy works
7222568 ive been tested four times in china before i even started running these guys took urine tests and blood tests after every event final ive been tested
7222569 ive been tested out of competition so many times i lost track
7222570 i worked hard thats all i can say i worked hard to get here it wasnt easy at all it may look easy but it was hard
7222571 therefore all the records that have been broken by usain bolt and all the gold medals that have been won by other jamaicans have come after extensive testing
7222572 that as far as i am concerned is more than adequate proof
7222573 what i think almost amuses us is why some people in the world dont feel that others can be that good we have been good for a very long time
7222574 we have some marvellous talent here and wouldnt want anybody to suggest at all that this is not pure raw talent that has been properly trained and properly coached and properly presented and reaping the rewards of all that hard work
7222575 i wont change that and i dont see any problem with it because people enjoy watching me
7222576 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur
7222577 this is an insult to the olympic vision an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and in my opinion an insult to mankind
7222578 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7222579 i love kayaking and i love racing but i like winning more
7222580 im proud of myself because of the stress and the pressure ive been dealing with over the past 24 hours theres been a lot of doubt in my mind and thats something ive never dealt with before so its a little victory for me
7222581 i tried to sleep a lot which i didnt i ended up tossing and turning a lot i didnt know what else to do
7222582 i turned on the computer and decided i didnt want to read emails i probably had four or five cold showers i tried to read but i wasnt interested in what kurt vonnegut had to say usually i eat it up
7222583 im used to finishing on top and im lucky to have that distinction its a bit much to ask that i do it every single time but thats what i want
7222584 the mounting pressure for the past six months knowing i was a potential double gold medallist knowing id won a lot of races until now but they dont really matter once you get here because its this one that counts that put a lot of pressure on me
7222585 i didnt have it when i needed it its just sports
7222586 i dont take anything for granted i didnt walk here thinking i had two medals in the bag no problem you cant its sports
7222587 ive been a front racer a lot of great races where i go flat out and i last to the line and everybody says man youve got a pace that none of us can hold that doesnt happen in the big races
7222588 no es perseguir con la pena de prisi n sino convencer a la gente de que tiene que cumplir
7222589 bekele usually likes to be the hunter now hes the hunted
7222590 it shows the chinese have come here to race today
7222591 i try not to look at it during the race because its just too scary to know that your heart rate is at 185 beats per minute or whatever it is
7222592 but i will check with a doctor when i will be at home before the next world cup
7222593 i was trying to encourage her because i could tell she was struggling a bit im sure she had a lot of expectations coming into this definitely she was a medal favourite but she did what she could and she has still had a phenomenal career

7222617 broadband on the move is bringing about a change in consumer behaviour
7222618 consumers can now do the things they would normally do at home when they are out and about
7222619 the days of the internet being something for the home are over for a growing number of savvy shoppers the online and in store worlds have now merged retailers should take advantage of the fact that customers may now have access to the internet whilst in store and for example use their wifi connections to deliver expert advice via a store intranet channel
7222620 its like having a consumer panel in your pocket when im on the high street i can now find out what other shoppers think before making a purchase price checking on larger items also makes me feel im more likely to pay a fair price
7222621 people want fit for purpose content that offers as sophisticated an experience on their handheld device as theyre used to on their pc at the current rate many businesses are in danger of being caught on the hop these findings suggest that consumers expectations may be outstripping the reality being offered by businesses
7222622 sag mal wir arbeiten hier schleich dich lass mich gucken arsch
7222623 im truly and deeply saddened it had to go this way
7222624 the really sad piece of this is whats important in life is friends and family
7222625 the only comment i can make is its a family matter its a tragic family matter
7222626 i think i understand accounting im on five public audit committee boards im the chairman of two ive been the chairman of the audit committee of probably the second largest financial institution in the country
7222627 he and a set of his colleagues were going to leave fairchild and start another company and wanted me to participate in this activity if id invest and come on the board and be a colleague of his
7222628 after a conference that the government ordered or orchestrated national security agency on how to build a very fast machine
7222629 as long as ive got the capacity to do it
7222630 shock i had no idea he had that much money
7222631 the evidence indicates both guzy parents ignored the existence of the childrens trusts and the terms of the 1977 agreement
7222632 its all about just going fast the jumping the competition
7222633 the teenage years are such an important age and this way i know theyre not out partying
7222634 this sport is great because you get to rely on yourself its not like a team sport because everyone gets to play
7222635 windows could not start the vmware virtualcenter server on local computer
7222636 why do we feel so afraid dont have to look very far dont get stuck in a rut its all in a nut in your brain
7222637 we threw our support behind cars and trucks and now its impossible to change its a chicken and egg kind of thing
7222638 a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands so that gods religion islam is made victorious all over other religions
7222639 rise to the challenge of defining themselves as a ethical nation
7222640 you may appear nice but we know there are sleeper cells of americans
7222641 please suggest any comprehensive work of tafseer quranic commentary for us muslim youth
7222642 islam wishes to destroy all states and governments anywhere on the face of the earth which are opposed to the ideology and programme of islam regardless of the country or the nation which rules it the purpose of islam is to set up a state on the basis of its own ideology and programme regardless of which nation assumes the role of the standard bearer of islam or the rule of which nation is undermined in the process of the establishment of an ideological islamic state it must be evident to you from this discussion that the objective of islamic jihad is to eliminate the rule of an un islamic system and establish in its stead an islamic system of state rule islam does not intend to confine this revolution to a single state or a few countries the aim of islam is to bring about a universal revolution
7222643 islamic jihad does not recognize their right to administer state affairs according to a system which in the view of islam is evil furthermore islamic jihad also refuses to admit their right to continue with such practices under an islamic government which fatally affect the public interest from the viewpoint of islam
7222644 these kinds of statements are really irresponsible because they can lead to violence against ordinary people i dont see any difference between that and al qaeda and osama bin laden using islamic theology to justify violence against americans whats interesting is if you compare their statements about what islam is and what muslims believe youll find they are almost identical and i reject both interpretations both the non muslims who are saying that islam justifies violence against christians and jews and the muslims who are saying it certainly these statements have a very unnerving effect especially when they continue when more than one person says it
7222645 as a practicing muslim i believe that there is a core of fundamental beliefs and practices that distinguish authentic islam from deviations
7222646 im convinced that it is not only inaccurate but unhelpful if our major concern is security security of this country this is a term that has very bad resonance in the muslim majority world and makes us feel uncomfortable here
7222647 the products that are coming from the muslim world are not being called islamic products or islamic oil
7222648 i believe that many americans believe that muslim women dont have any rights in islam perhaps they see images of muslim women being oppressed in different parts of the muslim world and believe that that is because of their religion but in fact we know that muslim women have the same rights as muslim men and virtually all the same duties and obligations
7222649 one of the popular misconceptions about islam is that women are seen as lesser figures that they dont have rights
7222650 this perception that women in islam are oppressed is based both on misinformation as well as am amplification of certain unfortunate tendencies in some parts of the muslim world its true that people have seen some muslim authorities using islam as a justification for the oppression or suppression of women thats a reality we cant deny it but we have to balance those incidents with whats going on in the rest of the muslim world in which most women are participating in their societies weve seen that within recent times four muslim majority nations have had female heads of state in most countries that ive traveled to muslim women are involved in all aspects of society
7222651 mattson muslim women have the same legal rights as muslim men the prophet mohammeds wife was a businesswoman in fact he met her working for her as her agent the legal rights of women were enshrined in islamic law however cultural practices in many societies have prevented those rights from being enforced
7222652 that can be frustrating i want to also make sure people understand that although american muslims do have a responsibility to clarify their views on terrorism and violence done in the name of islam we dont have control over these situations we dont have some sort of magic power over all muslims in the world
7222653 right wing christians are very risky allies for american jews mattson said because they the christians are really anti semitic they do not like jews and enter into the alliance on the basis of fundamentalist beliefs that it would be desirable for all jews to return to israel she suggested that fundamentalist christians might turn against jews or that there could be backlash from ordinary americans against jewish and fundamentalist christian supporters of israel
7222654 the american government has not criticized sufficiently the brutality of the israeli government believing that it needs to be
7222655 thus it is not permitted for a muslim to maintain a close friendship with a highly intelligent person who engages him or her in stimulating conversation if that person continuously derides the sacred quran 5 57 58 indeed since preserving faith is the highest priority it is important that muslims avoid demoralizing dependence on other faith communities for their protection and material needs clearly there are groups among american christians and jews who are so hostile to muslims that we should not join with them even in shared concerns lest we lend any credibility to their organizations there are many other groups within those communities however who are eager to work respectfully with muslims to further just causes
7222656 we see candidates being asked to prove that they comply with an ever narrower definition of what it means to be a christian forget about being a muslim or a jew
7222657 jesus our offering was 137 and i want to use it to buy bullets

7222659 die preise f r rohmaterialien wie stahl und kunststoff steigen au erdem stehen tarifverhandlungen an auch die lohnkosten werden also steigen

7222665 aber es stimmt ich habe andere angebote mich wollen viele klubs und wenn ich bei hertha nicht spiele muss ich mich umschauen
7222666 talk to people in the middle east and the uk
7222667 we are in liaison with the palestinian authorities hour by hour day by day
7222668 one of the reasons why its possible the reserve bank may reduce interest rates in a week or two is because the budget is very strong because the surplus is very substantial
7222669 its slowing somewhat but the reserve bank is still predicting economic growth to be in the order of two per cent
7222670 the overall employment figures are still very robust and we anticipate that they will continue to be in good shape
7222671 its very wrong to draw wider conclusions from these things what youve got to look at is all the economic data and that suggests the economy is still in reasonably good shape
7222672 we need to hear from mr rudd how he will address the current slowdown without rudd speak and without a commitment to simply watch
7222673 now that unemployment inflation and growth are all worsening it is time for mr rudd to set out how he will deal with these problems
7222674 the end result if they succeed will be that it will be harder for the reserve bank to cut interest rates
7222675 mr wayne swan and mr tanner are kidding themselves if they think they are responsible for any downwards movements in interest rates
7222676 this has been an unprecedented opportunity for western australia and they have wasted it
7222677 many western australians have missed out on the benefits of the economic boom many families are finding it tougher to make ends meet
7222678 a previous liberal government introduced a kindergarten program for every four year old and a pre primary program for every five year old
7222679 there are now 14 000 less students in our system than there were in 2001
7222680 for the first time in our states history our government school system has actually declined under labor
7222681 they have damaged the reputation of this great state both nationally and internationally
7222682 when colin barnett was education minister in 2000 the offer he put to the teaching workforce was 10 per cent over three years
7222683 fakra men sanateen etneen bas zay elnaharda kona 3amleen ezay
7222684 were starting to look very hard to find out where they are setting up
7222685 historically we dont have a large number of these outdoor grows
7222686 its always been a moderate number only a handful of cases
7222687 since many of the top podcasts are in the educational business segments its not surprising that podcasts today appeal to the more educated and higher income consumer segments
7222688 because these core audiences represent highly desirable consumer segments it is probably just a matter of time before significant advertising dollars begin to flow towards this medium
7222689 its not like were carrying nuclear weapons and these surfboards arent much heavier than a carry on
7222690 its ridiculous when youre having to pay more for your board than the price of your airline ticket
7222691 you have to skip nice meals and give up that nice bottle of tequila
7222692 there are handling costs associated with surfboards that we have to account for
7222693 they just think that its an extra pain on their employees that the boards take up extra space on their planes and that we make up a small percentage of its passengers
7222694 you know i just realized im going to be paying 360 to take my board along
7222695 weve gone from being characterized as environmental terrorists to being embraced this is like falling down a rabbit hole i feel like alice in wonderland
7222696 its been unbelievable to me that this has happened but this isnt my victory i just sat on guard
7222697 we hope to duplicate the things we do well one county away
7222698 the intent is to operate with a high standard of environmental stewardship
7222699 having a healthy well stocked forest will be a good investment over the long term
7222700 almost without exception i find these defendants to be honestly amazed at the seriousness of their conduct as far as the system is concerned
7222701 many of the defendants have no previous criminal history and have been productive members of the community and often there are complex psychological reasons why they are interested in child pornography
7222702 the images themselves are truly horrible even passive viewers of such material help to make its production profitable
7222703 the practical effect of possessing child pornography is to stimulate the market in child pornography which encourages things such as child torture and rape
7222704 and i didnt look at them or dwell on them very much
7222705 what we know is very limited to a very skewed sample because these are just the guys who get caught
7222706 as a prosecutor i dont really need to know why
7222707 for every one of these people we take down were intervening in preventing child abuse
7222708 the elements are very easy for the government to prove
7222709 there is nothing about prosecuting the bernie wards of the world that is going to stop the east european exploiters from marketing this stuff
7222710 its a chance to reflect on a remarkable fact that what you have here is a repository for all the knowledge and all the people for all time
7222711 hey we can read our books while were in line
7222712 when you go to trial and somebody is actually not guilty and the jury finds them not guilty theres sort of no better feeling because you were vindicated and due process was vindicated
7222713 she has a lot of the intangibles that make her a really good lawyer with a bright future in this office
7222714 they did what theyre supposed to do making sure dangerous people are held accountable but when we win its not whats supposed to happen its because somewhere along the way the police or prosecutors got it wrong and were the vigilant check against the system
7222715 he has the foreign policy chops that obama lacks and the experience inside d c he clearly could be commander in chief if need be
7222716 he speaks to blue collar america and the ivy league in strategy and foreign relations
7222717 with shootings you need to get there quick enough to get the shot of them loading him into the ambulance
7222718 unless hes dead on arrival if hes d o a youve got all the time in the world
7222719 to actually be in the middle of it all the gangs and all its just a visual feast
7222720 i swear on my life i was put on this planet to film police chases i swear on my life
7222721 if youre not living life on the edge youre not living life at all
7222722 you cant get close enough to the action for me if youre covering a fire and not getting burned or wet from the hoses youre not close enough
7222723 i remember having all this footage and not doing anything with it
7222724 i even had footage of an injured firefighter which is gold these days
7222725 ill keep doing this till i cant get out of bed in the morning
7222726 the kids will be strapped down in the back seat
7222727 woke up this morning with my mind stayed on freedom
7222728 nein gaben beide frauen wie aus der pistole geschossen zur ck nein berhaupt nicht
7222729 we know people are going to drive we want them in their cars for less time
7222730 i believe in local control i come from a city council
7222731 but traffic congestion doesnt all of a sudden go from bad to good when you cross any particular city or county border and air quality and climate challenges dont respect artificial boundaries
7222732 most people dont want to live in dense urban cores most people want a little elbow room they want a yard for their children to play in
7222733 they want a little grass a little garden a little breathing room they can call their own and who the hell are you to tell people they cant
7222734 its either going to be some regulation restricting your behavior or some huge tax and neither of those is politically popular
7222735 so theres been a big debate about whether we can do this all with carrots
7222736 ive spent most of my 30 year career fighting regional planning and regional government
7222737 but what you are seeing here is a pretty thoughtful approach there are incentives for in fill development and building along transportation corridors and in the end it doesnt prevent development in suburban areas it just says there are standards and it has to be done well
7222738 will you please stand for the national anthem of great britain
7222739 i studied in england for five years at a place called newport in shropshire
7222740 figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7222741 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7222742 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7222743 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7222744 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7222745 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7222746 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7222747 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7222748 you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of privatizing social security
7222749 you cant change america and end this war in iraq when you declare and again these are johns words no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have end of quote
7222750 a long process but it always pointed in bidens direction
7222751 many others were discussed but my impression was that those three a few weeks ago were really the centerpiece kaine bayh and biden
7222752 ich frage mich ob eine firma mit 4 000 besch ftigten keine abteilung hat die in der lage ist sich mit den angeh rigen von neun mitarbeitern in kontakt zu setzen die bei einem arbeitsunfall ums leben gekommen sind
7222753 viele von uns erhielten vor dem absturz von unseren verwandten sms aus dem flugzeug dass mit der maschine etwas nicht stimmte
7222754 sen joseph r biden jr joins the democratic ticket as an acknowledged foreign policy sage whose 36 year record has won him bipartisan praise as a liberal internationalist who generally hews close to his partys center
7222755 we are going to become the shining beacon on a hill
7222756 what do we want the state of nevada to look like
7222757 he was left to die on the floor of the emergency room and just didnt have a chance
7222758 screaming and yelling saying that her husband is having chest pain
7222759 calm this screaming wife before she can settle down and give us the information
7222760 someone get me some help hes having a heart attack
7222761 youre tired of the struggle you held on as long as you could
7222762 after being in the emergency room area for approximately an hour to an hour and 15 minutes mr scheinbaum collapsed and mrs scheinbaum was screaming for help i along with many others in the waiting room was shocked by the apparent lack of concern by hospital staff for mr scheinbaums insistent complaints about chest pain and a possible heart attack
7222763 shocked by the nasty nonchalant and uncaring attitude of the hospital staff mrs scheinbaum repeatedly told them of her husbands heart problems and pleaded for help however it appeared that the staff did not care
7222764 so i think it would have to be extraordinary you know like a bomb going off in the emergency room to mitigate not bringing such a patient back right away and getting them medically seen and stabilized
7222765 based on the anticipated census it was predicted that 18 rooms would be sufficient to handle the anticipated load that evening
7222766 i listened to you speak a lot about the safety of the buses and bus stops and of course im very angry that this happened to me as you can see im a double amputee who was hit at a bus stop along with another lady who was killed july 7 2008
7222767 im not concerned at all about the shelter and prettiness and whats being done now
7222768 i have a 4 year old son and an18 month old daughter were not going to be going outside running anymore playing in the house dancing all that is ruined
7222769 the last time i heard that i almost resigned from this committee i was so disgusted how can you place a dollar value on somebodys life
7222770 where it comes to an individual property owner we have to depend on their good offices to do that
7222771 if people say no they say no and theres not a lot we can do about that
7222772 its all about just going fast the jumping the competition
7222773 the teenage years are such an important age and this way i know theyre not out partying
7222774 this sport is great because you get to rely on yourself its not like a team sport because everyone gets to play
7222775 nvidia is going to bring to san jose which is the epicenter of silicon valley the ecosystem thats involved with visual computing scientists engineers artists films gaming
7222776 we hope that the outcropping of the conference is just a burst of new ideas of innovation moving the state of the art
7222777 democrats because weve burned in the last few elections get nervous and skittish right around this time
7222778 it means that people are going to hesitate a little bit ba rack o bama theyre still getting past that name
7222779 i use an external flash for my nikon d200 the nikon sb 800 speedlight
7222780 if you have that you know you can point it towards the ceiling and get much nicer light than if you use the direct flash but you had to go out and buy that and that cost you at least 350
7222781 and about 400 for the lumedyne battery and the speedlight burns out all the time and to get it repaired costs about 200
7222782 add to that cost when you went to the party last night some people bring their sb800 but its a heavy piece of equipment to carry around a lot of professionals when theyre not on the dime prefer to travel lighter
7222783 there are two clear things going on here one is the cost of that piece of equipment and the second is the convenience of not having to have it all the time with you the lightscoop is a 30 item and under some circumstance you get just as good a picture
7222784 youre probably aware that most professional photographers when theyre working in a studio or taking portraits of anybody use a soft box or an umbrella
7222785 its hard to carry around one of those big soft boxes or even an umbrella so the secret is to bounce the light off the ceiling you can either do that with the 800 pound gorilla the sb 800 speedlight strobe or you can use my little light scoop
7222786 im able to use the little flash that flips up on a camera and turn it into a beautiful light source
7222787 how high can the ceiling be and this still work
7222788 the ceiling generally has to be a light color and it shouldnt be more than about 12 feet tall after that it simply doesnt work anymore not enough light comes back to make a well exposed picture youre sb 800 speedlight wont work in a gymnasium it wont work in a church with a high ceiling and it wont work outdoors
7222789 but it will work if i shoot it forward instead of up
7222790 correct so will the pop up flash but then you get the bad light but you cant bounce either one when the ceiling is too tall
7222791 when you hit a subject directly with light the farther they are away the less light they get
7222792 to counteract that to bounce the light off the ceiling youre bringing the light down evenly with the person near the camera and the person farther away theyre now getting even light because the lights coming off the ceiling and its the same distance from the near person and the far person
7222793 so how come we didnt have this ten years ago
7222794 when i went to teach my advance lighting class i always teach them how to use an external strobe but because so many students today have the camera with the pop up flash i thought it would be clever to show them how to take the light from the pop up flash and make it into a beautiful light
7222795 i worked with a design student at san francisco state to create the shape of it and the attachment of it and the right angle of it and the size of it
7222796 i never even dreamed it would take off i wanted a patent ive written a lot of books but ive always wanted a patent i never thought of it turning into a great financial success we had no money for advertising we didnt have a business plan we just made it and put it out there
7222797 how does this reduce red eye i dont even know what causes red eye
7222798 the light from your strobe goes out and hit somebody in the eye and it goes to the back of the eye where there are a lot of veins filled with red blood the light bounces off the back of the eye and comes straight back into the lens the path of the light is into the eye and back out what comes back out is red where the pupil is my device angles the light off the ceiling so instead of the light coming directly from the source and back to the lens its coming in at a different angle
7222799 the sun is a long ways away therefore it makes a sharp shadow that harsh shadow light makes you look unattractive in the middle of the day thats exactly the same effect as the direct flash it makes sharp shadows the soft box wraps the light around the subject the shadows become softer
7222800 if we lived on a planet nearer the sun the sun would be a larger light source and you wouldnt have this problem of course youd burn up
7222801 the bigger the light source the softer the light the sun is so far away its a tiny light source and makes a harsh shadow
7222802 ive noticed that women over 30 complain about harsh light when they go out socially they know they dont look good in a harsh fluorescent glow their every skin flaw shows
7222803 were talking about wrinkles the reason youre seeing a wrinkle is that you are seeing a shadow in the light part of it the harsher the light the more shadows it brings out the softer the light the less the winkles come out thats why people of a certain age dont appreciate the harsh light that makes for harsh shadows hollywood has lots of techniques around that problem but you as an individual photographer the simplest way is to create that soft light with my device for portraits you can bounce it off a wall if your subject is within ten feet of a wall and that gives you that soft window light
7222804 how do you bounce the light off a wall im looking at a picture of the lightscoop and it shoots the light up to the ceiling
7222805 so you turn the camera to the side and shoot it vertically the face is normally shot vertically anyhow
7222806 the rocky mountain states are undergoing a tremendous transformation the republican party has not recognized if its going to maintain its dominance its going to have to change to changing circumstances
7222807 clearly public investment is very important and colorado is making a huge effort to make sure its future is tomorrows industries and not yesterdays
7222808 youve got to get good ideas to the marketplace so they can do things for society
7222809 weve had a lot of success since we revitalized the office
7222810 i mean for a state official to say theyve been helping here is just a joke
7222811 they got energized once they knew they had some help they knew they werent going to have to do it on their own
7222812 it was really the beginning of the demise of the republican party weve known in nevada for 25 years
7222813 ive never seen organizing like this were in as good a shape as ive ever seen in a presidential election barack obama has a campaign organization that is unparalleled
7222814 rural america all over this country has been really hurt by the bush mccain policies
7222815 if you think its tough to live in las vegas and pay 4 a gallon for gas think what its like when you have to commute 50 miles folks are quitting their jobs in rural america because they cant afford to commute anymore
7222816 but if john kerry had won nevada colorado and new mexico this convention would be about him
7222817 its a totally different landscape than what we had in 2006
7222818 almost every observer expects that within three years there will be a cap and trade system in the united states
7222819 that said for political expedience it has to be done
7222820 there is no way politically in the u s that any politician can stand up to the coal industry
7222821 there is likely to be a tremendous subsidy for this industry whether it is appropriate or not
7222822 coal comprises 50 percent of our energy generation at this point
7222823 the harder political solution is rolling back the other subsidies
7222824 this is one thing that has gotten caught up in partisan politics this year
7222825 of the things that might get done in september this is first the mostly likely and second the most important for the economy because if these tax credits expire it will have a very clear and very negative impact on the economy
7222826 one of the huge shortcomings in his proposal is it understates the complexity of building a latticework of transmission towers up to the midwest
7222827 were open to all of these things there is a lot of technology being developed
7222828 but in the short term we have to keep the power flowing
7222829 its such a simple thing for the customer to do
7222830 we know it works we know it saves people money
7222831 the challenge is we have a lot of buildings that are not well designed
7222832 to get to what hes suggesting is not feasible in my lifetime
7222833 if you give the utility companies a mandate to do it and then create the incentives for saving they will pursue conservation with the same vigor they pursued power plants in the past
7222834 a lot of hip hoppers are saying things that obama cant exactly endorse
7222835 so we wanted to make sure the video reached beyond black america and could be something everyone could appreciate
7222836 we wanted to reach a broader audience and feature the lyrics verbatim throughout the video in case some people are not used to digesting hip hop lyrics
7222837 we wanted a video that united people working for a cause
7222838 i said s a t whatever i want to r a p
7222839 i miss those days and so i pout like a grown jerk wishin all i had to do now was finish homework its true you dont realize really what you got til its gone and im not gonna sing another sad song but sometimes i do sit and reminisce then think about the years i was raised back in the days
7222840 when i stepped on campus something in my gut said dude this is where you belong
7222841 rapping and teaching are not that far apart youre rapping youre talking youre a professor youre talking
7222842 i always thought i was better than average that i was handsome smart and talented it was a trick
7222843 being black in america from the ghetto you need that extra little bit of confidence so thats kind of my mission to give other kids that kind of confidence
7222844 a certain laxity in some physicians once they were out of medical school and finished with graduate training
7222845 hugh butt believed in a state of constant learning self administered tests have become widely accepted standardized and a basic requirement for any physician who pursues an academic practice
7222846 the governments long campaign to tame wildfire has perversely made the problem worse
7222847 generations of peninsula residents have grown up seeing this building for the last 15 years or so theyve seen it deteriorating
7222848 well have so much more visibility right there in the nature preserve
7222849 its going to be a huge boost for the organization
7222850 hhhmmmm there might be some value in spending some money here
7222851 broken government how republican rule destroyed the legislative executive and judicial branches
7222852 when she found out she was getting this award she told them she wanted to share it with me
7222853 im truly and deeply saddened it had to go this way
7222854 the really sad piece of this is whats important in life is friends and family
7222855 the only comment i can make is its a family matter its a tragic family matter
7222856 i think i understand accounting im on five public audit committee boards im the chairman of two ive been the chairman of the audit committee of probably the second largest financial institution in the country
7222857 he and a set of his colleagues were going to leave fairchild and start another company and wanted me to participate in this activity if id invest and come on the board and be a colleague of his
7222858 after a conference that the government ordered or orchestrated national security agency on how to build a very fast machine
7222859 as long as ive got the capacity to do it
7222860 shock i had no idea he had that much money
7222861 the evidence indicates both guzy parents ignored the existence of the childrens trusts and the terms of the 1977 agreement
7222862 almost without exception i find these defendants to be honestly amazed at the seriousness of their conduct as far as the system is concerned
7222863 many of the defendants have no previous criminal history and have been productive members of the community and often there are complex psychological reasons why they are interested in child pornography
7222864 the images themselves are truly horrible even passive viewers of such material help to make its production profitable
7222865 the practical effect of possessing child pornography is to stimulate the market in child pornography which encourages things such as child torture and rape
7222866 and i didnt look at them or dwell on them very much
7222867 what we know is very limited to a very skewed sample because these are just the guys who get caught
7222868 as a prosecutor i dont really need to know why
7222869 for every one of these people we take down were intervening in preventing child abuse
7222870 the elements are very easy for the government to prove
7222871 there is nothing about prosecuting the bernie wards of the world that is going to stop the east european exploiters from marketing this stuff
7222872 this book is an excellent learning tool like any other tool you get out of it exactly what you put in my advice is to spend as much time with each section as you need if you do that you will walk away with every bit of the knowledge an industry thought leader can provide
7222873 they told the soldiers we dont need your food we dont need your clothes
7222874 il ny avait quun seul endroit en limite nord o les villageois leur avaient dit nallez pas au del de cette limite parce que sinon on aura des probl mes

7222879 if we continue being a lawless society which is what we are doing we are well on our way to anarchy the point is that as admitted by johnny de lange the deputy minister of justice the system is not working
7222880 the second point is that if the law is broken then the authorities must act but we have so many cases in this country of selective law enforcement that the wheels have come off in general
7222881 by may 29 2006 11 suspects had already been arrested across gauteng and they were facing charges of murder attempted murder and assault with grievous bodily harm
7222882 in cases like these where many were killed mainly by being thrown off trains by their supposed colleagues its very difficult to make murder charges stick
7222883 the thing is where you have political involvement where the unions are involved there are not going to be charges brought
7222884 thats the way it is you can forget about it
7222885 it could be that it will be an internal matter
7222886 l deder a ser separado por el resto de su vida y denunciado a la polic a dentro de nuestro deporte no queremos ser considerados idiotas yo nunca hab a visto algo semejante tras 40 en el taekwondo

7222888 he started down an incline and tried to get his truck in a lower gear to slow him down some but left the truck in neutral when he couldnt get it in gear and jumped out
7222889 in the 1950s in new york you didnt find that many full time working mothers but my mother was and she needed someone not just to run the house but to run everything
7222890 she taylor was looking for something on a little bit more sophisticated level and my mother was thrilled to have someone with so much education and so much common sense
7222891 she was just an absolutely wonderful person she was a very dynamic person who was way ahead of her time
7222892 she was a liberated individual woman way before many women were and we benefited from it my brother and i were very lucky she came into our lives
7222893 she was just part of the family she was included in anything we did
7222894 she was a very moral woman a very ethical woman
7222895 she had to ok the man i married before we got engaged before we dated seriously
7222896 every year they sent cards to her for her birthday and christmas addressed to grandma bea kramer said
7222897 when we heard she was moving home with arnem we were happy
7222898 she said no ive bought my mausoleum plot here and my friends are buried here
7222899 it was a sunday morning and we went straight to the parkers house
7222900 but she taylor said i want you to sleep over at my house in kimball
7222901 she gave me her key and said i want you to see if my room is in order she gave me these strange directions so i went to the house and it seemed in disarray drawers were opened like somebody had gone through her things my husband and i looked around near her bed and i found a bank book hidden and thats when i found out she had a sizable estate
7222902 on the day we left west virginia mr parker claimed she taylor wrote a check for 80 000 to him
7222903 at that point in time i could not get a call through to bea unless i called three or four times and left messages previous to that i could get a call through anytime day or night
7222904 to themselves and defeated her taylors wishes that she wanted to leave everything to mrs kramer
7222905 when the judge dismissed the jury everyone of them walked by us
7222906 and at least eight or nine of the 12 stopped shook my hand and said god bless you i had tears in my eyes the foreman walked back shook my hand and said god bless you dear i was so grateful
7222907 we were clearly outsiders and they were so fair and decent i think they weeded out the truth
7222908 these people just made me so proud to be an american
7222909 they were so thoughtful they considered everything even if theyd ruled against me they followed it the case closely and i was so grateful to them
7222910 it is proposed and the proposal is supposed to be finalized by aug 26
7222911 however the law cant go into effect until it is reviewed by the legislature under legislative review between now and when the legislature convenes in february we will need to invite all of the people who have an interest in free clinics to the table and work out a solution that will accomplish the objective of assuring that we have quality control over the free pharmaceutical aspects of the free clinic without strangling the free clinics with an obligation of having a physician charge under the current proposed rules
7222912 the interim session starts sunday and will go three days
7222913 the issue isnt scheduled as far as i know before any committee but it is certainly an important current issue about which we need to start a discussion so by the time of date of implementation of new regulations arrive sometime after the legislative review we will have addressed all of these issues and will have input from the people directly involved this is one of those situations where the news media has been very important in helping to identify the problem and addressing both sides of the discussion so the legislature needs to take it from there to make sure the concerns are taken care of with legitimate objectives being considered
7222914 we should be able to address those issues to achieve the objective of quality control in an area where most everyone would reasonably agree that quality control would be a good thing but also make sure that health right clinics can continue to operate in the same manner as they have in the past
7222915 so senate bill 722 was introduced last year in the senate
7222916 when the bill was introduced i raised the very same questions which are being raised now and on the floor asked the sponsors that if despite their good intentions if the bill might fatally effect those free clinics for a number of reasons i was assured but not assured enough to vote for the bill i voted against it initially the bill then went on to the house and on the last day of the session came back to the senate and it was suggested in the senate some of the problems had been corrected and the bill did pass the senate as amended by the house
7222917 in short if you look at the project as it is today the feedback we are getting from our customers is that in many areas it is not what they expected
7222918 in many ways we are finding it is blending in with the community more and more each day
7222919 because some of the power lines built in the early 70s and 80s were really louder the technology there was something we pioneered it was the first time it was used the reason we went to the technology was in our area with the higher elevation moisture drizzle and snow a lot of the weather we get when those things came into contact with our generation of 765kv lines they would sizzle like bacon frying they had a buzz people were concerned about that it the new six bundle configuration performed in excess of our expectations
7222920 whenever a project like this is announced you often gravitate to a worse case scenario
7222921 but many of the folks we have talked to have felt like it is much less than they expected for example i was out on the appalachian trail in the spring and was actually producing the video we talked about and stopped and asked a hiker his opinion of the power line he had been under it twice and didnt know it was there
7222922 weve really tried and genuinely tried to work with people and the localities and the organizations to number one put them in the best place and number two to reduce the impact
7222923 the point was if we had lost the big line it dumped everything on the 345 line and it couldnt handle it
7222924 weve now secured this area we now have two 765kv lines i you lose one the other continues to flow
7222925 das streben nach moralischem handeln ist das wichtigste streben des menschen

7222936 te sientes un poco frustrado pero al mismo tiempo es un orgullo correr con gente as
7222937 la clave estuvo en saber aguantar en los ltimos 50 metros
7222938 he corrido como ten a que correr aunque en la recta final me he hundido

7222940 i admire the jonas brothers because they are all so down to earth and all of them really remember where they come from and they stay grounded unlike alot of other famous people
7222941 we have issued orders to our men to allow journalists
7222942 we have clear cut instructions not to allow the media persons we will not talk to any officer of the force dont enter into argument and go home otherwise we will teach you a lesson
7222943 never go in against a sicilian when death is on the line
7222944 never let your name be found in a dead mans trousers
7222945 other towers other turrets protruded from the medieval ch teau they called the temple deceptively religious name but this tower was different larger easily 60 feet in height and black like the inside of a chimney and lord of all its secrets whatever was in there stayed there
7222946 legend has it that if you give vidocq two or three of the details surrounding a given crime he will give you back the man who did it before youve had time to blink
7222947 more than that hell describe the man for you give you his most recent address name all his known conspirators tell you his favorite cheese
7222948 do the rights of religious freedom and free speech as guaranteed in both the federal and the california constitutions exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination based on a persons sexual orientation our answer is no
7222949 all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal and no matter what their sex race color religion ancestry national origin disability or medical condition are entitled to the full and equal accommodations advantages facilities privileges or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever
7222950 it really is as if california has banned its citizens from having moral consciences
7222951 you must merely obey what the state says you have no right to follow your own moral guide
7222952 these were doctors who did not feel right morally about performing the procedure they actually treated the lady in many aspects but at a certain point said no we cant participate in this for moral reasons because the person is not married and referred her to another doctor who would have provided the treatment but just couldnt do it immediately
7222953 imagine somebody who runs a store for maternity clothing who refuses to serve single women or gay women because the owner believes that it is immoral for such a woman to have had sex let alone to have a child
7222954 up until the 1960s the courts general view was that the free exercise of religion clause in the u s constitution does not give anybody the right to exemption
7222955 discrimination against healthcare professionals on the basis of their sincerely held ethical standards
7222956 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who
7222957 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7222958 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7222959 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7222960 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit p off even william hartnell the first doctor had trouble back then he was often ill and forgot his lines
7222961 they say that our aggression our toughness came out of our slave situation
7222962 considering that jamaica had more slavery rebellion than any country in the world
7222963 its not a question of genetic pool but we have that
7222964 its a cultural thing too that we want to achieve
7222965 i think that he knows full well that his athletes have been using drugs
7222966 he set out to set up a lab to cheat they caught him he went to prison and now hes casting aspersions on other people who have stayed in this sport the last 40 years and have been clean
7222967 from 1948 until now we have been coming to the olympics in sprints ok and we have done well this is just a culmination of what has gone on for more than 40 years
7222968 which is difficult to translate exactly but could be said to mean though we may be small we are powerful beyond expectations
7222969 at the end of the day though there is a culture of track that the jamaicans have now mastered at a very high level
7222970 if usain bolt were born in north america or europe he would be now earning far more money as a professional basketball player with the odds of a much longer and more lucrative career
7222971 once upon a time they were saying we have it because we have fast fibers
7222972 so i said to them how many countries have fast fibers only a few areas in the world ah these are theories that dont hold strong when you have a complex situation
7222973 we passed exams at universities abroad because of the strength where other blacks failed
7222974 we feel because other people are now caught the playing field is now more level for us
7222975 all of them trained in the states and we caught them down in kingston
7222976 you remember that guy who believed in god so strongly
7222977 our athletes are strong believers in the almighty they believe that without the almighty they can do nothing and with the almighty they actually can do everything
7222978 we know that our athletes have trained hard that the country would not tolerate any kind of cheating because we are a moral christian country
7222979 not at all i was a good friend of davids even before he got the role of the doctor and hes the most delightful chap
7222980 plus theres the fact that we come from the same area of scotland
7222981 id love it if the next doctor who was also scottish
7222982 hed crack up the daleks with a few well timed gags then afterwards they wouldnt be so morose
7222983 they might even come to the conclusion that you dont have to rule the universe to have some fun
7222984 after it was cancelled i fought for years to make executives change their minds so its good to know that i was right all along
7222985 luckily ive had my own wee bit of fan fervour last year i was also in stratford acting opposite ian mckellen in king lear
7222986 loads of doctor who fans came along to watch and get autographs afterwards
7222987 i didnt mind that they still thought of me as a time lord
7222988 it just meant that the doctor was steering people towards shakespeare which is no bad thing
7222989 people who listen to the music might think its sweet but in reality its about people being threatened with torture and execution
7222990 although its set in japan gilbert and sullivan were actually writing about the britain of the victorian era
7222991 we were doing a lot of nasty stuff back then with our empire
7222992 these days you could look at the mikado as a piece about american or russian imperialism
7222993 i decided to do it for a bet me and my school friend danny sweeney bet each other that wed go down and tell the local priest that we wanted to train for the priesthood
7222994 my pal chickened out but out of bravado i went through with it then stayed on for four years
7222995 eventually i decided that i preferred chasing skirt to wearing one
7222996 but it made great training for acting since both involve wearing a great costume and performing in front of a captive audience
7222997 i suppose you could also say doctor who is a religious show
7222998 hes a being from outside our world who is willing to risk his own life to save us all
7222999 i was an actor working at the roundhouse in london at the time
7223000 the rolling stones were playing there so i was asked to work the stage as a bouncer
7223001 this was in the innocent days before violence was invented
7223002 so i just danced about the stage next to the band then went for drinks with them afterwards
7223003 so no one better dive onto the stage during the mikado
7223004 or i really will be using my bouncer training to make sure that a few heads really do roll
7223005 notre nation nest pas pr par e faire face ces ph nom nes extr mes qui vont samplifier lavenir en raison dune baisse des budgets et dun manque dint r t qui dure depuis des ann es

7223010 les pays industrialis s doivent prendre des mesures pour r duire les missions de gaz effet de serre
7223011 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7223012 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond
7223013 we are continuing to raise our concerns at senior levels of the chinese government and to follow their cases closely
7223014 if theres a bad call the whole crowd gets into it
7223015 when the tvs on im watching the game and he just peeks in
7223016 the park itself has something to do with crowd response
7223017 people get to know each other my daughter and son in law sit behind us
7223018 it was one of the reasons i wanted to get a ball club here
7223019 like pittsburgh there are hard working folk here these people are loyal if you give them a reason to go someplace theyll go
7223020 we know the boys are learning and this is their first stop
7223021 its fun to watch my heart breaks when they dont do well we know their future dreams and goals
7223022 weve been to a couple salt lake bees games and the crowd is more quiet subdued people can come here and have a good time
7223023 this is the best spot right here especially when the sun goes down and its not quite so hot

7223025 so how we are going to use him and in what volume that remains to be seen
7223026 but he will be used as much as he can be used
7223027 we had a small part of the offense in the plan for austin and it was situational against teams that we thought might be vulnerable to a given thing or just situations we thought he could manage extremely well so it has been in place prior and then i would say there has been increased urgency where i wasnt pleased with our backup quarterback play last saturday that gave me more urgency now to think that role needs to be back and maybe expanded in the event that max were hurt or something like that
7223028 we do our best to make it an uncomfortable situation for them so they can work on the communication
7223029 well be ready weve played in a lot of loud stadiums before

7223042 we couldnt run the ball on them we were outmanned
7223043 for a while i was saying that our team was really figuring out how to play on the road but after these last two road games it is hard to feel that just because of the number of chances were giving away
7223044 its not even the number of goals were allowing though the game tonight probably could have been six or seven it seems like weve got to take a few steps back here and figure things out quickly defensively
7223045 hes so fast hes literally invisible to american viewers until 13 hours after he finishes

7223050 what is so modern about sword fighting and target practice
7223051 by anyones reckoning these olympics have been a disaster for australia
7223052 most galling of all has been our complete and unmitigated failure in the equestrian competition if theres one olympic sport that captures the spirit of open minded egalitarian australia its dressage a competition in which pampered tights wearing nobodies get to dress up in tails and sit down for a few minutes to boss around their horses if the government has any sense it will make investment in this most watchable of sports a first order priority for the next 12 months
7223053 but if you stop being physical you stop giving yourself a chance to play because it is going to be a physical game i can call tennessee coach phil fulmer and ask if we could just play touch i dont think hell go for it

7223095 were dedicated to providing our customers with waste and recycling solutions that protect and enhance our environment

7223113 it is not clear whether they are being held for political purposes as bargaining chips or for financial purposes but journalists who spoke on condition of anonymity for their security said the abduction seemed to be a pre planned attack
7223114 we are appalled by this cruel abduction of journalists and call for the immediate release of our colleagues

7223119 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7223120 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7223121 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7223122 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7223123 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7223124 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7223125 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7223126 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7223127 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7223128 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7223129 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7223130 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7223131 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7223132 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7223133 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7223134 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7223135 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7223136 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7223137 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7223138 who are open to doing something on the production side
7223139 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7223140 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7223141 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7223142 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7223143 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7223144 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7223145 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7223146 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7223147 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7223148 lewitts drawings have become landmark works in the museum and we are sorry to see them go
7223149 but we are happy to announce that new works will be installed in the atrium
7223150 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7223151 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7223152 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7223153 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7223154 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7223155 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7223156 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7223157 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7223158 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7223159 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7223160 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7223161 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7223162 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7223163 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7223164 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7223165 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7223166 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7223167 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7223168 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7223169 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7223170 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7223171 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7223172 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7223173 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7223174 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7223175 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7223176 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7223177 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7223178 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7223179 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7223180 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7223181 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7223182 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7223183 christies 2007 sale which totaled 14 567 975 confirmed its position as the world leader in spanish art sales this unique category of art is securing record prices year after year the spanish team is looking forward to building on their previous success with the 2008 sale

7223188 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7223189 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7223190 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7223191 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7223192 io vorrei di quegli abbracci che sanno di braccia attorno
7223193 io ti ho amato andr e non saprei neanche immaginare come si possa amare di pi

7223207 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7223208 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7223209 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7223210 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7223211 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7223212 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7223213 wir wollen nicht dass es so weitergeht dass alle vier stunden eine neue moschee in italien errichtet wird fr her hatten wir mit den moslems zu tun jetzt mit dem islam das hei t mit einer gesellschaft die nicht zwischen politik religion und kultur unterscheidet und unvereinbar mit unserem juristischen system ist die imams sind bischof b rgermeister und schulleiter in einer person
7223214 grundfalsch daf r gibt es die musalla beliebige orte die man daf r benutzt die moscheen sind ein politisches symbolisches und sehr oft auch milit risches zentrum der islam lebt seit jahrhunderten im widerspruch zum westen und befindet sich mit diesem im kriegszustand
7223215 aber die polygamie ist bei uns strafbar wir verlangen den respekt f r die frau
7223216 wir wollen weder minarette noch muezzine die mit ihren lautsprechern die ruhe st ren und keine moschee in einem radius von weniger als einem kilometer von einer kirche entfernt
7223217 sie m ssen sich registrieren lassen und italienisch sprechen wir m chten wissen was sie sagen und ob sie zum dschihad aufrufen
7223218 den moderaten islam gibt es nicht er ist nur der deckmantel f r den terrorismus
7223219 passen wir gut auf diese leute wollen hier in padanien norditalien f r die lega nord richtige islamische kolonien errichten
7223220 no person shall drive a vehicle at a speed which endangers the safety of persons or property
7223221 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7223222 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7223223 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7223224 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7223225 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7223226 docs and local police are still looking to find the family
7223227 i dont agree with the one size fits all policy he is a small baby 2 49 kilograms five pounds eight ounces and they give the same dose to babies twice his size i just wanted time to get more information about the vaccine
7223228 itll be something thatll have to be assessed once that child is located
7223229 i am a strong believer in vaccinations being voluntary but not getting this baby vaccinated is a form of child abuse
7223230 i dont agree with the one size fits all policy he is a small baby 2 49 kilograms five pounds eight ounces and they give the same dose to babies twice his size
7223231 but there will have to be lots of consumer education before they will accept it
7223232 maybe the science community has not spoken enough about this
7223233 but they will be doing it more and more now
7223234 i advertisement hope we will see a reduction in the number of food borne illnesses
7223235 it gives the industry another tool to increase food safety
7223236 there is no reason to suspect a toxicological hazard due to consumption of an irradiated food
7223237 with all the scares that there have been involving spinach this is a good step forward
7223238 why arent they looking at the source of what causes these problems
7223239 the growers and shippers of spinach and iceberg lettuce will conduct assessments to see how effectively this can be accomplished with produce and what investment will be needed
7223240 i think there is a long way to go before irradiation is implemented
7223241 in a way its like erasing your mistakes and saying something is safe that is not produced in a safe manner
7223242 the treatment of food with ionizing radiation can produce a variety of beneficial effects
7223243 however it should be clear that irradiation is not a remedy for unsatisfactory production practices
7223244 it is unlikely that irradiation will have significant nutritional impact on a balanced diet of raw canned and ready to eat fruits and vegetables
7223245 we dont have much concern about the safety of irradiated foods
7223246 the flooding is definitely something that we are monitoring and tracking and he was down there to see what kind of handle he could get on that
7223247 shops and restaurants are within the regulations of high standards
7223248 the tool used by society to allocate its scarce resources
7223249 those who dont value the commodity at its price level would not use it
7223250 resulting in adequate supplies for those who place an equal or higher value on it under these conditions there are no shortages however when priced below that equilibrium level shortages occur as consumers willing to pay more because they value it more than the price cannot satisfy their wants
7223251 thag has noted that only certain special interest groups were issued tickets and those whose prime responsibility it is to sell the tourism product were left out in the cold unable to fulfil their mandate

7223253 and he for some reason has not he has been able to use his expanding congressional advantages seniority the right committees relationships huge staffs and connections with groups all over the country and the world hes maintained that kind of internal excitement and drive for now nearly 50 years
7223254 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7223255 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7223256 i know hes working on the speech because theyre phoning in edits every few hours
7223257 is now the seat of individuals who were appointed illegally and that means that in the minds of many people the court symbolizes illegality

7223266 we believe the deployment of ipv6 could be critical to sustaining the scalable growth and innovation that has distinguished the internets development over the past 30 years
7223267 theres no question that routine delivery of real world production information services of this sort is the best tangible proof that native ipv6 service stands ready to meet the current and emerging needs of the higher education high performance networking community
7223268 the internet2 land speed record provides an important demonstration of ipv6s readiness to support day to day network applications
7223269 with the successful deployment of voipv6 application we are seeing the end of the dark tunnel and finding the bright light and business models of next generation networks based on ipv6 protocol
7223270 technology companies have branded the internet as a place that is always on and where information is always available people are disappointed and looking for answers when it turns out not to be true
7223271 this is a free service its not like anyones life is depending on twitter
7223272 twitter is all about the things we discover we have in common so right there twitter failing is a huge thing we have in common
7223273 when these sites go away its a sudden loss its like you are standing in the middle of macys and the power goes out
7223274 when the thing you depend on to live your daily life suddenly goes away its trauma
7223275 these companies have a responsibility to people who rely and depend on them just as people going over a public bridge expect that the bridge wont suddenly collapse
7223276 there are millions of web sites and billions of web pages around the world
7223277 there are currently 1 5 billion people using the internet which means that there are a good 4 5 billion people who are not doing so
7223278 these people are not from europe or america most of them will be from developing world nations where the roman script is meaningless
7223279 the com suffix is so well established that i dont think many companies will want to replace it
7223280 microsoft microsoft is not only harder to remember it takes longer to type
7223281 we are seeing consistent trends indicating young people are becoming more violent
7223282 there are clearly changes in the behaviour of young people responsible for this crime
7223283 youth violence is still largely driven by young males but young females are trending upwards
7223284 the long term increases show sharp percentage increases for the younger age group those between 10 and 14
7223285 its generated competition and encouraged them to look at ways of gaining status

7223287 the problem of hitmen is real and we are facing it all over the country people offer their services to kill someone for a price

7223289 could impede the investigation being conducted and thereby interfere with law enforcement
7223290 in the criminal context its trickier because its the government asking for stuff and i think its going to be harder to fashion a rule especially when the government is not exactly willing to part with the reasons
7223291 was somebody found face down on their keyboard and the ip address was going to help identify the killer
7223292 time and time again youll have jurors sitting on a jury panel who will condemn material that they routinely consume in private
7223293 we can show how people really think and feel and act in their own homes which parenthetically is where this material was intended to be viewed
7223294 all you had to go on is what was available for public consumption and that was a very crude tool
7223295 the prospect of having measurement of internet traffic brings a more objective component than weve ever seen before
7223296 its a very fundamental issue with how the entire addressing scheme of the internet works
7223297 youd have the internet but it wouldnt be the internet you expect hackers would control everything
7223298 people should be concerned but they should not be panicking
7223299 we have bought you as much time as possible to test and apply the patch something of this scale has not happened before
7223300 i was looking at something that had nothing to do with security this one issue affected not just microsoft and cisco but everybody

7223308 something like the next half hour is brought to you by
7223309 net radio is good for musicians like me and i think most musicians are like me
7223310 the promotion it provides is far more important than the revenue
7223311 theyre not going to chase a company whose business model has been broken so if it doesnt feel like its headed towards a solution were done
7223312 there are plenty of hacked company databases for sale online but the sheer volume and quality of the information thats been stolen in the best western raid makes this particularly rare the russian gangs who specialise in this kind of work will have been exploiting the information from the moment it became available late on thursday night in the wrong hands theres enough data there to spark a major european crime wave
7223313 large corporate companies rely on anti virus products to protect their infrastructure but the problem with this approach is that these products only detect around 60 of threats out there in the right hands viruses can easily bypass these programs as was the case here

7223356 the olympic games in beijing were a huge success for adidas both in china and around the world
7223357 we were clearly the leading brand in terms of visibility across all sports during the games we provided first class service and exciting products that were especially made for beijing we also made our mark in communication with our campaign together in 2008 impossible is nothing that won the first ever golden lion for china at the cannes festival so the olympic games in beijing brought us another giant step closer to our mission to be the leading sports brand in the world
7223358 we already used the uefa euro 2008 tm in austria and switzerland to grow our football leadership and now we demonstrated at the olympic games again that we are the brand that is at the core of sports with the platform of the beijing 2008 olympic games brand adidas has become market leader in china in terms of revenues market share and brand perception

7223489 it was never my deal it was your media deal
7223490 sometimes youve all done things where you press i think there was some of that i think you put a lot of pressure on yourselves sometimes and it affects your ability to perform
7223491 in this case i just think it was a matter of him going out and relaxing having fun getting that smile back on his face and i saw that tonight i think the way the offensive line played has something to do with that he looked like his old self to me
7223492 you might have to think of a couple new things to write this week
7223493 but hey whatever its just good for morale to get in the end zone
7223494 i said theyre really going to make this thing hard
7223495 he gave me the opportunity to catch the ball and i just tried to make a play on it
7223496 the gods honest truth is that i wouldnt rather be anywhere but st louis thats where i was hoping to go
7223497 last year i tested out as the second strongest player on the team my strength has been questioned but i try and prove it
7223498 the goal is to do everything the coach tells me to do every day compete and make plays and if they feel like im fit to be ready to play in september then i am
7223499 the main nickname was the ram killer thats what the seattle people called me and i guess thats what some of them called me here but no longer
7223500 the window is only so big and i realize im getting towards the end of that i still enjoy playing i still enjoy the whole experience of it
7223501 i said im going to find a way to do everything different this year
7223502 the general theme is things are going to be different and expect them to be different
7223503 no ones making any promises right now no ones saying what the records going to be no ones saying how many yards were going to average but we know what we want to do we know what our goals are the expectation is going to be completely different
7223504 and our performance is judged obviously by on the field performance
7223505 we know what we are a team that won three games last year we werent successful the status quo was not acceptable
7223506 i mean everything things that i do everybody you try to start out with what did we do right and what did we do wrong and then the question is well what is the causation
7223507 what was wrong about this and why did we end up doing it wrong did we just make a mistake is this something thats been a trend or is this something we really have to fix that requires a longer term solution
7223508 youre not going to build a championship team by free agency
7223509 nobody takes that approach if it works out you get one or two guys that can start in free agency i think thats all you can expect
7223510 a few years ago the pool of free agents was much bigger
7223511 especially now the number of players involved its not a lot to pick from
7223512 it is early but i think the signs are positive
7223513 you cant guarantee what the performance is going to be but you can guarantee preparation
7223514 the question is when the adversity comes you have to plan and be prepared to face the adversity
7223515 its not always easy to have the answers but its going to come and you cant stop it
7223516 once you start getting confidence you start figuring out a way to go on the road and win a tough battle
7223517 maybe one game you win it on a defensive score next game you have a shootout offensively you just figure out ways to win to me the biggest message is weve got to find that formula and weve got to do it as a football team
7223518 they have been incredibly supportive and offered their assistance in whatever way possible and theyve clearly stressed that the most important thing is the team performance
7223519 theyve been nothing but supportive between chip rosenbloom and lucia rodriguez and john shaw and obviously i work with jay zygmunt on a day to day basis
7223520 they want nothing more than for our football team to have success and to say we did pick the right guy it pains me to not be able to give them the product especially a year ago
7223521 we felt we should have done a lot better in every way basically
7223522 but it happened if you lament about it its not productive youve got to take the experience turn it into a positive and work that much harder make sure youre smarter about your approach
7223523 my biggest flaw is that you spend all week beating yourself up to the point where you cant let it go
7223524 i think thats the no 1 job of a head coach that he gets his team moving forward no matter whether you win or lose a game
7223525 i couldnt handle it at all my first seven years at philadelphia
7223526 i was still mulling over on friday why we lost and were playing again sunday
7223527 later you develop a philosophy where hey you move on and you learn how to handle it if you as the leader cant handle it your squad isnt going to handle it your coaching staffs not going to handle it
7223528 youve got to have that short memory youve got to move on to the next week and you cant get caught up in how it feels
7223529 but youve got to do what you thinks best the biggest lesson i learned last year is i need to surround myself with as good of people as i possibly could
7223530 the people who have been successful in any business and in this game have had great support im talking about from players to coaches to support people the real good ones do a great job of delegating the responsibilities and trusting and having faith in those people
7223531 to me i feel like i could always go back and coach at a high level as a coordinator but thats not what i want to do thats not my goal those were my goals
7223532 once i was fortunate enough to be given the opportunity that i have in st louis its all about being the best head coach that i possibly can be and to do that i need to have the best coordinator i can possibly have on offense the best coordinator i can have on defense the best special teams coach and then assistant coaches and then players that fit our system and support staff
7223533 i think its important that i have a relationship with all the team
7223534 i always felt i had a good relationship with the players but im not sure i could say i knew every player because i was pretty consumed with the offense
7223535 there has to be a sense of urgency from everybody within our organization to not just do better but do a lot better
7223536 take it to a whole different standard if by approaching it that way it doesnt work well so be it

7223664 they were taken under the threat of firearms it was an abduction
7223665 its clear that they were kidnapped because their schedule was to come back to the hotel before 12 in the afternoon and we dont have their whereabouts
7223666 we contacted the place where they were heading but so far they havent seen them
7223667 we are deeply concerned that our son nigel brennan may have gone missing near mogadishu in somalia yesterday
7223668 he is a freelance photographer who arrived in kenya just over a week ago
7223669 we understand that the australian government is making urgent contact with relevant somalian authorities as well as the canadian french and british embassies to help locate nigel
7223670 has deplored the recent killings of innocent victims and the resulting displacement of people in kismayo
7223671 he said that the fighting was to control the port for resource generation and not as portrayed in some places a political or other issue
7223672 kismayo is relatively calm today saturday but residents in janayabdale village reported new clashes in the area
7223673 the remnants of the clan militias and some of their commanders tried to cross janayabdale where they encountered an attack from the islamists several people were injured in the clashes
7223674 there was some sporadic gunfire overnight from friday to saturday but no fighting
7223675 the major battle is over but the militiamen that were dislodged by islamists may try their luck to regain the town
7223676 they dont really believe that the theater missile defense components in poland and in the czech republic although they are very small are in fact in the end really intended for iran
7223677 the other piece of this is that the russians have opposed the general national military defense program of the united states for a very long time
7223678 and they put the two things together they think this is the camels nose under the tent that the united states is putting in place in alaska now in central europe and who knows where next the components of an effective for a much more extensive ballistic missile defense system that would be directed against russian nuclear capabilities
7223679 the president traveled to georgia august 13 when there was a rally in tbilisi and stood beside georgian president mikhail saakashvili and said now we see the real face of russia
7223680 here is the president of poland clearly suggesting that russia is a serious military threat to all its neighbors that is obviously going to lead to the action that its has taken that is to defend itself as best it can
7223681 the russian military actions in georgia not only broke through whatever resistance the polish government had to doing the deal without getting further satisfaction on the terms of the deal but in addition pushed both sides to build in these extra defensive measures which are clearly directed against russia
7223682 no one raises any question but that the patriot missile battery or batteries that are to be put in poland plus the joint administration and patrolling of them by both u s and polish forces is designed for russia
7223683 if the russians should do anything to attack those missiles and american lives are at risk then that would mean that the debate about whether or not the united states would actually do something to protect members of nato would become academic
7223684 and indeed because american troops were there it would serve as a trigger and the united states would react
7223685 we have also called in the army to assist the police in enforcing law and order
7223686 fighting is still going on we hit and destroyed over 40 militants bunkers and a training camp
7223687 we have confirmed reports that 50 militants were killed while 10 of our soldiers were martyred

7223716 fighting intensified overnight with battles raging near the towns of datu saudi ampatuan and datu piang all in maguindanao province
7223717 we have done our best to embrace peace but the milf started the hostilities by pillaging villages and murdering innocent civilians in mindanao
7223718 now we are implementing the full force of the law and we will arrest those responsible for the traitorous attacks against civilians
7223719 this is a grim scenario and i dont even want to think about it but if the peace talks collapse then there will be war again in mindanao
7223720 the voice of reason is dwarfed by the voice of hatred and prejudice
7223721 the peace talks are slowly breaking apart and if this continues may god help us all
7223722 a clear endorsement to move forward this is also endorsement of the decision taken by the president and the government to eradicate terrorism from the country
7223723 one is constantly on the move missing the ones pavilion

7223728 this is such a proud moment for kenny his family friends and supporters a moment in which all of us can gladly share
7223729 kenny fought a brave fight and gave everything in a wonderful bout of top class boxing
7223730 not only did kenny do us proud in the ring but he was also an inspirational captain throughout the whole boxing tournament
7223731 kenny and our two other medalists paddy barnes and darren sutherland can be truly be proud of their achievements they have done themselves and ireland proud

7223737 if we restrict our phone numbers and addresses that restricts our accessibility
7223738 i think this achieves a good balance by keeping public information public and allowing employees to control the dissemination of their private contact information
7223739 if there is any message to iowans it would be that the university administration supports their employees legitimate interest in avoiding unwanted contacts at their homes
7223740 the first four states they picked that isnt going to change
7223741 what this deals with is more of the macro problems with delegate selection and front loading and can we come up with a system to make it a little more orderly and spread that out over the remaining process
7223742 i dont see it as having any negative impact on iowas first in the nation status
7223743 franchises are making a fortune off the misery of these dogs
7223744 you go in and fall in love with a puppy what they dont tell you is the conditions the puppys parents are living in
7223745 our heart is behind these animals i would stand down on the corner with them when it comes to real puppy mills
7223746 but we dont feel were doing anything wrong here were taking these puppies and giving them a home
7223747 he looked completely ok he was just happy for the ceremony then we went to a greek restaurant nothing looked like it was going wrong with the family
7223748 arthur will always remain in the hearts of his wife children and family our memories of him would bring us to the library where he was taking his son for saturdays storytime to the farmers market where we would enjoy outdoor music performances and eat some freshly baked muffins to all the wonderful games which he played with his sons at home
7223749 he is a very humble man and he is extremely kind to others he was pleasant to deal with so this is shocking
7223750 she wanted to have a complete family and i think it was her decision as much as it was his
7223751 he was always very fit we didnt perceive him as an old man i think there was a very honest and sincere relationship he was a very good father
7223752 your definition of a liberal professor who would rub it in your face
7223753 i love professor miller dont get me wrong but we started off on the wrong foot
7223754 i always had a sneaking suspicion that he felt bad for making fun of me all the time and so just gave me an a for the class
7223755 another friend didnt see it that way he thought he didnt feel bad he thought that he was scared that he was going to get reported
7223756 all of the schools should provide a quality education across the board
7223757 all of our students deserve a better education than they are getting now
7223758 id give the board an f and f is for failure
7223759 develop a culture and climate that is inviting of all students
7223760 i think theres going to be another wave of consolidation
7223761 i see right now more districts in potential financial difficulty than ive seen in the almost nine years ive been doing this
7223762 we certainly didnt go into russell thinking were going to make an example
7223763 but it really did send an alarm through the system
7223764 we didnt really want the state coming in telling us what to do
7223765 if we wait longer we may not get a say
7223766 the state may come in and tell us what to do why wouldnt any parent want a say in what happens
7223767 were at the end of our financial string here and we have to do something different
7223768 dr m was a great school and i have a lot of great friends there but weve gotten so close with ev that it will almost seem more comfortable there
7223769 i think it will happen faster than the last wave
7223770 the last set of consolidations was 20 years ago and before that was 40 to 50 years ago
7223771 i think its doubling in time were into another set and i think that set will be good for about 10 to 15 years and well be looking at another set
7223772 there are not good post consolidation studies to show if what was promised has actually occurred
7223773 people continue to recite the conventional wisdom even though theres not a lot of evidence to support it
7223774 to come up with financial projections for credit card balances
7223775 they have not even confirmed the arrests and they have not even acknowledged the diplomatic note sent
7223776 we hope that foreign affairs can do something as far as we know they have not been charged they have just been detained in a manner that is reminiscent of the old apartheid regime
7223777 they are people who work for the betterment of others and for the pleasure of god they have been detained for a week and no reasons have been advanced for that it is very scary
7223778 the families are pleading for their loved ones to be allowed to come home
7223779 the arrest and detention of these people smacks of islamophobia it is racial profiling and stereotyping where south africans who are out there doing relief work come under fire
7223780 i think senator obama could benefit from a little joe mo right now
7223781 if you were to talk to hillary clinton she has nothing but the highest respect for joe biden
7223782 he can deliver a pretty good attack with that trademark smile
7223783 not only does he bring foreign policy experience the best our country has to offer he has a great resume
7223784 dont listen to the pundits who say he doesnt represent change
7223785 i have absolutely no doubt about what is in his heart and the commitment that hes made with respect to racial equality in this country
7223786 its senator obama showing us hes trying compensate for an area of weakness and an area where senator biden has criticized him on foreign policy
7223787 joe biden is a safe choice well liked on both sides of the aisle obama has in a way selected a mccain
7223788 durante a opera o militantes armados enfrentaram as for as da coaliz o que responderam com fogo leve e mataram os militantes
7223789 id like to personally thank gisler errington and annett cecala for the work theyve done on this project
7223790 without their efforts our company would need be able to meet the demands of the burgeoning consumer market when demand increases the only way to provide for this change is an increase in technology most importantly we wont be laying anyone off all current employees in our drennon littleton county plant and all las vegas nevada politics project employees will be guaranteed employment for 3 years
7223791 on more than just one level as a reporter its a great story and as a citizen of madie belyea borough i know that my neighbors will still have their jobs one has to realize that this will only strengthen the local economy and drive new business to our area these factors are key to economic survival and to my fellow citizens as we move forward in the next few years
7223792 well be hiring more workers within the next 6 months why because while some jobs will be made redundant in the new profit model we can take the talents of these valuable employees and parlay them into other equally paying jobs within our corporate structure
7223793 were excited to learn that over 1000 new jobs will be created
7223794 the mall traffic is ok but not very high quality now with over 1000 new people visiting each day business will surely skyrocket
7223795 mostly because well need time to train these employees to be as effective las vegas nevada politics producers as possible
7223796 we chose to use perl in our las vegas nevada politics text studies because it is a lingual programming language
7223797 and also because it is easy to combine with other programming languages perl is easily installed on linux platforms and modules can be compiled that allow us to communicate with database technologies
7223798 with increased profits well be able to hire more employees and really grow our business
7223799 all week whilst we have been setting up it was raining and we did seriously wonder if it would be best to cancel
7223800 but the weather has held out really well and the show has been a great success im very pleased we decided to carry on
7223801 we had so many problems last year with foot and mouth movement restrictions and so its wonderful to see so many breeders here today there has also been a very good crowd
7223802 paramedics from the response vehicle travelled with the ambulance crew and provided additional assistance while the man was treated on route to hospital
7223803 i gave it everything in qualifying and it was so close out there but we are second in class so i cant complain
7223804 the porsche had a little bit more on us but the car is in very good shape for race conditions which is always what were working on its all about race pace staying out of trouble and having great pit strategy which i have to say is something patr n highcroft racing excels at and thats why were so close in the championship we are looking strong for a great battle tomorrow
7223805 it was a good day for the patr n highcroft team
7223806 we had a good car after yesterdays practice and weve just continued to make small changes and improve david had hoped to get the lmp2 pole today but weve been in the top three or four overall every session so we have to be pleased with our consistency i havent raced at mosport for 15 years but i have enjoyed reacquainting myself with the track after its improvements ive had a lot of success here in the past so its good to see its still the raw aggressive circuit its always been as there arent many of those left it should be a good race tomorrow
7223807 obviously this wasnt the result we were looking for we clearly felt that we had a pole capable car today but some gamesmanship by the number seven penske thwarted davids fastest qualifying lap but weve straightened that out were looking forward to a fast and exciting race tomorrow
7223808 dees dat paard lijkt wel op maud als die mensen nou geen naam hebben noemen we hem gewoon maud en als we 2 witte paarden hebben noemen we er ook eentje maud
7223809 dees ik zou nog wel een ritje op maud willen maken
7223810 i was just walking out to the bus after a game
7223811 she was one of the volunteers and she just started crying that was a trip
7223812 the tough thing about that is it wasnt everybody but we were guilty by association
7223813 hopefully we can change peoples perspectives about us because we dont want people thinking were jerks or a we want people thinking were representing our country correctly and are doing it the right way
7223814 we werent told we needed to fix our image this is just who we are were good people anyway
7223815 they know all our stats they know where we come from they know everything about us
7223816 its amazing it really is just how popular basketball has gotten it really has gone global
7223817 once i get down from my long journey like a 45 minute walk now im thirsty so im looking for something to drink and lo and behold i see a gatorade and im like can i get a gatorade and they asked for some crazy amount of money like 3 000 yuan and i looked at it and i saw my picture and i looked at them and said this is me and she was like no no money so i have to come up with the money i had to buy three or four of them because of how thirsty i was and i didnt even haggle her down the kid in me came out i was shocked to see my face on it ive been with gatorade as an endorser a couple years but it just shocked me at that moment that i was there on the bottle so i invested into gatorade as well
7223818 the way theyve treated us over here thats whats going into the memory bank
7223819 people are treating us like were on top of the world which were not
7223820 we want to win we want to dominate and show we can still dominate the game
7223821 i know myself as a fan i want to see a good game i dont want a see a team win by 20

7223824 the principal advantage is persistence that you would be there all the time
7223825 a satellite goes over the same part of the earth twice a day and one of those is at night so its only really getting a snapshot of activity zephyr would be watching all day
7223826 we think zephyr is very close to an operational system within the next two years is what were aiming for
7223827 we have one more step of improvements we trying to design a robust and reliable system that will really sit up there for months and we want to push the performance
7223828 a lot of effort has gone into power storage and light weighting the systems
7223829 lithium sulphur is more than double the energy density of the best alternative technology which is lithium polymer batteries
7223830 they are an exceptional performer weve worked with the sion corporation theyve had them in development for years were actually the first application in the world for them
7223831 i think with british ingenuity wit and resourcefulness we are going to produce a games an opening ceremony a closing ceremony and all the stuff in between that is going to be in our own sweet way just as fantastic
7223832 i am absolutely determined to make sure that we come in under the 9 3bn i have no reason to think that we will have any difficulty in doing that
7223833 i will ensure that london taxpayers and indeed british taxpayers do not pay a penny more
7223834 we are going to have a wonderful games and i can assure you all my team is working very hard to make sure that we protect value for london taxpayers and that people coming to london will enjoy themselves
7223835 we do need to be firm on this we cant allow the olympic delivery authority or whoever else involved with the games simply to try and hold taxpayers to ransom
7223836 the games are for the athletes the games are not for london the games are not for great britain
7223837 in the long term those 3 000 units we are building in east london are going to be a vital part of the legacy we want to see out of the olympic games thats why it would be completely senseless to economise

7223858 it is indicative of the talented competition in our series that another tenth would have moved either car up to fourth in class
7223859 if qualifying is an indicator we expect tomorrow will produce another notable mosport race

7223899 we have a bit of a catch 22 here because people complain about microsoft and their perceived lack of security but as soon as they try to do something to make it more secure the users dont want that
7223900 they are resistant because it keeps them from doing all the things that they have always done
7223901 it does a great job of keeping people from being able to browse certain sites it protects from viruses because there are a lot more things that will get locked down and the lock down tends to be tighter you have a tougher time having things happen accidentally probably the biggest hassle from a security perspective in the past is users tended to run as administrators in vista thats not the default anymore
7223902 its likely inevitable that you will make the move to vista eventually so why wait

7223962 there is concern at the very highest level that kate middleton still does not have a job one royal source told the newspaper
7223963 the queen is keen that the monarchy should lead by example and that the princes and their girlfriends should all be seen to be hard workers
7223964 the queen has made it known that she feels kate should get involved with a charity possibly an animal charity where she can be seen to be doing something proactive and something entirely safe
7223965 it is important that kate isnt seen to be doing anything controversial and she needs to do something completely different from any of the charity work that diana did
7223966 she has quite a bad reputation for being rude when it comes to responding to letters one friend told the newspaper
7223967 she often fails to rsvp when she is asked to attend events she once failed to reply to a wedding invitation from one of williams friends and it didnt go down very well

7224005 they could have gone to anywhere in europe buy theyve got the confidence in cardiff not just the stadium but cardiff as a whole to deliver we should take some strength from that

7224027 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7224028 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able to bring to the table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake
7224029 after eight years at the side of president clinton and seven years representing new york in the u s senate
7224030 her celebrity status notwithstanding clinton is at heart a worker in the trenches she has an encyclopedic knowledge of the issues and her success in the senate on behalf of new yorkers attests to both relentless attention to detail and skill at working the levers of power
7224031 yesterday kids all over america spent the day looking for easter eggs and today their parents are in new york at bear stearns trying to find their nest eggs today at the white house president bush hosted the annual white house easter egg roll young kids roll easter eggs with spoons across the white house lawn what fun that must be for kids if this was 1908 in more serious news big controversy last week after state department officials looked at passport files of all three major candidates turns out they got a hold of john mccains social security number got his social security number you know what it is three well heres the big brouhaha former new mexico governor bill richardson still thinks hes loyal to the clinton family despite endorsing barack obama loyal he just endorsed barack even bill was more faithful to hillary than that actually the reason this is such a big story is that bill richardson was a member of the clinton cabinet and clinton adviser james carville on good friday he called bill richardson a judas called him a judas well you know there are a lot of biblical references in this race now theyre calling bill clinton jonah because he was once swallowed by a whale and larry craig did not file for re election by the deadline he legally cannot run for office again how about that ironically you know why larry craig missed the filing deadline he was in the mens room a democratic congressman from michigan john dingell wants to put an additional 50 cent tax on every gallon of gasoline gee im starting to understand why the democrats keep blowing these elections see the revenue raised by this goes towards repairing all the damage caused by taxpayers rioting over the fact that gas went up another 50 cents and former new york governor eliot spitzer now in rehab for sex addiction theyre trying to figure out why he wants to have sex with young women with no strings attached i dont know maybe cause hes a guy its just getting worse for him in the new york post today a former madam said that eliot spitzer would pay to watch other couples have sex he would pay to watch other couples have sex well thats something we dont have to worry about the new governor doing we will finally be safe there the president of france said today his country will reduce its arsenal of nuclear weapons because if theres one thing the french hate its being too prepared to defend themselves
7224032 you folks have a nice easter yesterday in new york city was the annual central park easter egg hunt amazing 1 500 eggs they found 1 500 eggs and three dead guys yesterday in new york everybody was in the easter spirit as a matter of fact former governor eliot spitzer he was in the easter spirit he spent the day with someone named bunny did you hear about this two state department employees were fired this is a bit of a scandal because they were looking at barack obamas passport file not only that but the same person was also looking at john mccains civil war records listen to this ladies and gentlemen youre not going to believe this there is a new super toilet on the market being described as high tech low flush senator larry craig just drove one off the lot he said by god ill take that little number senator larry craig from idaho he did not sign up for re election he is not going to run for office again so dont let the stall door hit you on the way out larry after the scandal you get the sordid details this is what i hate were now getting the sordid details with eliot spitzer former governor apparently when he was out whoring during sex he would always wear his black socks i know what you are thinking thanks dave for searing that image in our brains for me the only thing i keep on is my hair piece black socks well for heavens sakes who does this guy think he is rosie odonnell
7224033 judging by these surveillance photos you should get that thing on your ass looked at
7224034 spring is finally here spring when a young mans fancy turns to thoughts of love and eliot spitzer turns to the yellow pages also the fifth anniversary of the iraq war how romantic once again they forgot to greet us with flowers traditionally this is the wood anniversary five which is fitting cause thats what dick cheney gets when he thinks of war the war is going into its sixth year with no end in sight the economy of course is tanking but what is america freaking out about right now that apparently barack obama went to a church and heard his pastor criticize america and just sat there everybody knows when you hear something your pastor says that you dont agree with you get up there and you punch him in the f face and you beat him with the cross not only that this reverend wright apparently he officiated when obama got married wait til they find out the wedding band was the wu tang clan the thing is republicans of course dont allow dangerous religious freaks to advise their campaigns they nominate them of course obama had to answer this did you watch his speech he hit all the notes he said racism is real for black people he said white resentment is real for white people but at the end of the day why cant we all come together with the shared knowledge that asians cant drive the good news is on youtube the obama speech now is getting watched more than the clips of the pastor the bad news is that its still far behind the footage of spitzers hooker on girls gone wild this chick is everywhere i swear to god she won american idol the last person to get this famous for f some idiot was kevin federline new yorks new governor david paterson he made history this week hes black hes blind and hes hornier than the last guy he hadnt taken his hand off the bible when they swore him in before he admitted to having multiple affairs see this is what women dont get about the male sex drive he was blind and he still wanted to see other people and its not easy having an affair when youre blind he used to come home with lipstick on his shoes his wife was cheating too did you know that i would have loved to see that confrontation honey i may be blind but im not blind and now the new york post says that eliot spitzer is in therapy for sex addiction im not sure he really understands the process today he requested an analyst with really big tits
7224035 winter officially ended this week so thats good news yeah today al gore blamed the end of winter on global warming sunday of course is easter another big problem for barack obama this easter sunday wheres he gonna go to church easter of course is the time we celebrate miracles see we dont have miracles like easter and the resurrection and the parting of the red sea anymore you know what im saying like today our idea of a miracle is gas under 3 50 a gallon boy there is nothing but disasters in the news its unbelievable floods in the midwest fires in texas the democratic party its just unbelievable to give you an idea how bad the democrats are doing in a stunning reversal john mccain now 10 ahead of hillary clinton and 7 ahead of barack obama and this is after iraq a recession and no health care imagine how far ahead hed be if the republicans had actually done something this week john mccain received a warm welcome in israel he was in israel you know he is hugely popular in israel ever since he stood with the jewish people against the pharaoh theyve never forgotten president bushs approval rating has reached a record low 31 wow his popularity is so low now on his facebook page he only has imaginary friends the cover of time magazine asked the question what did hillary do as first lady well we know what she didnt do bill and osama bin laden has released another anti american speech and out of force of habit barack obama denounced the remarks and said he wasnt even in the room at the time the statements were being made anyway critics are pouring over osama bin ladens latest audio tape simon called it pretentious paula said it was not his best work and randy said dog its just not working for me according to a new study by the university of british columbia and harvard money can buy happiness but only if you spend the money on someone else to which former governor eliot spitzer said see according to the new york post eliot spitzer has entered therapy for his sex addiction he has sex addiction hes not horny a sex addiction see i dont know if its gonna work when the therapist told him it was 300 bucks an hour he said what can i get for an extra 50 have you heard about this playgirl magazine made an offer to eliot spitzer to appear naked in the magazine isnt that unbelievable i tell you you know who really wants to see that spread former new jersey governor jim mcgreevey in tibet the rumor is the dalai lama might be stepping down yeah it turns out he was client number 11
7224036 a new cnn poll just came out about the campaign interesting results a new study shows that wine drinkers prefer hillary clinton to the other candidates yeah after hearing this bill clinton asked how much wine have they had i guess this is good news former new york governor eliot spitzer has reportedly entered therapy for a sex addiction spitzer said his therapy is going well and that his therapist has a fantastic rack in new jersey today there were dangerous winds with gusts up to 50 miles an hour the winds were so strong that they blew former governor mcgreevey off his chauffeur well of course this sunday is easter of course easter is that very very holy day when christians around the world honor a 2 000 year old jewish man who is not larry king a big insurance company just announced they will give 10 million to anyone who can invent a car that gets 100 miles per gallon meanwhile exxon says theyll give 11 million to anyone who kills that guy
7224037 when people in this worn looking city near pittsburgh lament how the sagging economy is slowly crushing them some are also quick to add how much hillary clinton could help them
7224038 with that in mind i believe that the best candidate for philadelphia is the one who has not only ideas but the skills to implement them is willing to embrace change while also working in collaboration with us at the local level is experienced and willing to extend a helping hand and possesses both good judgment and a profound sense of social justice based on those criteria ive made my decision on which candidate i support i have endorsed senator hillary clinton hillary clinton has an impressive 35 year record of fighting on behalf of working families and children fighting for universal health care for every american and has a comprehensive plan to end the war in iraq and restore our standing around the world but most importantly she has a strong commitment to revitalizing our urban centers and i believe that under her leadership our american cities will rise again the hillary clinton agenda for revitalizing philadelphia and other major metropolitan areas is called leave no city behind and it creates a vital partnership between our efforts here in philadelphia and the efforts of the federal government
7224039 pledging to work her heart out if elected president democratic candidate u
7224040 we need to send someone who can be commander in chief and president
7224041 hillary clinton evoked themes of sisterhood and motherhood while addressing women voters in blue bell today and reminded them shed be a strong commander in chief and a fighter for universal health care
7224042 we have seen changes that are unimaginable for our mothers and grandmothers
7224043 there were colleges i couldnt go to scholarships i couldnt apply for
7224044 there must be a republican gremlin in the sound system
7224045 this is an issue of equality and justice this is a family issue
7224046 to solve the current crisis hillary clinton believes we need sorely missed proactive policies that ask what is best for families on main street
7224047 children need to feel good about themselves and i encourage parents to encourage their children to be their best
7224048 set the example not only in education but with character be a good citizen were not only teaching skills that apply to education were teaching life skills as well
7224049 some parents may feel intimidated about going to their childs school but they dont need to
7224050 get involved and visit your childs school we really do welcome parents
7224051 for the little ones just let them know school is a great place so they wont be anxious or nervous
7224052 its very helpful when a child believes in themselves and believes the parents believe in them
7224053 parents can help improve attendance grades and the relationship students and teachers have
7224054 be an active participant in the childs education get involved with pto volunteer in the classroom be there and active
7224055 just know teachers are trained and are out to help the student
7224056 when a child has wonderful things happen we let the parents know that
7224057 that way if things dont go well at times we can call and theres much better rapport with the parent
7224058 let us know early if there are potential problems that could effect the childs education
7224059 a lot of the time if we know up front we can do things to assist the child and nip a lot of the problems in the bud
7224060 talk to your children and know their goals and how those goals fit in with the goals of the school
7224061 almost without exception the students who fail are the ones who dont turn in their work or dont get things done on time its not because they dont have the mental capacity its because theyre not doing the work
7224062 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7224063 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7224064 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq news up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7224065 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7224066 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7224067 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7224068 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7224069 you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of privatizing social security
7224070 you cant change america and end this war in iraq when you declare and again these are johns words no one has supported president bush
7224071 a long process but it always pointed in bidens direction
7224072 many others were discussed but my impression was that those three a few weeks ago were really the centerpiece kaine bayh and biden
7224073 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
7224074 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7224075 continues to be committed to doing whatever he can to ensure that senator obama is the next president of the united states
7224076 may be in a palace it may be in the streets may be here among us on a crowded beach but evil is alive and well

7224095 dancers are dramatic and emotional and i think its really compelling to watch
7224096 what these shows have replaced is what we no longer have a large support for the arts
7224097 the government no longer supports the arts theyre not fed like they were
7224098 weve seen a big increase in interest since the shows went on air
7224099 weve done a lot of ballroom classes and choreographed dances for weddings dance is on the brain
7224100 of course some of these shows are not for the dance purist
7224101 but it has such a domino effect on dance and getting people to think about dance its really just fantastic
7224102 people know the difference they see how hard these dancers work and realize that its a skill
7224103 at the same time it may inspire them to learn something new

7224105 because each search engine have their own way to place and rank a site on their search result but there are some general

7224107 big search engine like google and yahoo basically have that logic too when ranking your sites so

7224143 fighting is still going on we hit and destroyed over 40 militants bunkers and a training camp
7224144 we have confirmed reports that 50 militants were killed while 10 of our soldiers were martyred

7224146 without a doubt have failed to live up to their obligations under the ceasefire agreement
7224147 establishing check points and buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement

7224182 south africa is well prepared to host the cop 3 and if we get the hosting right it will speaks volume of the commitment to africa as greater awareness would be raised on the continent
7224183 we want to support the south africa bid and want this passed to the bureau
7224184 the nigerian government should have plausible review that would benefit the company including other policies of the government tobacco regulations
7224185 ovviamente le olimpiadi di pechino hanno creato il terreno per altre stupidaggini riportate in at the beginning of class we stood at the front of our mats and let out a long dirgelike moan
7224186 then the teacher yelled chili pepper pasta and everyone hit the floor
7224187 in principle we need international concerted action to counter any act of illicit trade in tobacco product including counterfeit
7224188 there is need for more power to fight the illicit trade in tobacco and that is why we at wco want the protocol to begin
7224189 we need international law and a stronger mechanism to control the diversion of tobacco products prevent the smuggling and get at the underground manufacturing plants that we know exists
7224190 our mandate is to protect the health and safety of the people while ensuring a sustainable economy we are willing to work but the protocol will make our work easier it cannot wait
7224191 of any team we should know how hard it is to get there and win that game
7224192 i thought he might end up going but i wasnt sure he ever wanted to go
7224193 theres pressures so when he decided to stay obviously i was excited because hes a great kid and a great leader
7224194 i remember when i told him i was coming back
7224195 i firmly believe that if i get hurt that wasnt gods plan for me to play football
7224196 my dad was in and out with wrestling so it wasnt like we went to church every sunday
7224197 i used to pray and read a lot of bible in high school

7224201 we did not come into this match to get a sliver medal it was the gold we wanted so i am disappointed
7224202 for me we failed in 1996 in atlanta we won the gold and here we did not
7224203 but i am proud of my players they did everything we asked them to do but we were unlucky not to take our chances
7224204 they had one chance and they took it that is football
7224205 nigeria have got very good players and they are a very disciplined team
7224206 we had seen the players on video a lot of times and we knew about their attacking strength
7224207 we studied them very carefully because we saw they had very dangerous players the number 9 nsofor and the number 14 odemwingie were very fast and very skillful so we needed to play intelligently and move the ball around
7224208 we wanted to let the ball do the work because we knew we had good players who could change the game at any point
7224209 how can you do this yet say you practice corporate social responsibility
7224210 not doing enough in terms of enlightenment campaign in tertiary institutions on the dangers of tobacco
7224211 because they students are not properly enlightened some of them see tobacco smoking as
7224212 i am neck deep into the tobacco story bat has been bombarding me with calls and emails since i let them know i am doing a story on the libels etc
7224213 in response to loss of market dominance and income in developed countries tobacco companies are channelling their massive resources and promotional machinery to lure impressionable youths in the developing countries of africa to long term tobacco use

7224219 sinn f in recently carried out a survey in the belfast rd area of the city regarding a loyalist band competition which is to take place on 29th august the results of the survey revealed that 88 9 of residents are opposed to the march
7224220 this band competition has always been hugely contentious in newry with the closing down of two main roads in the city ensuring maximum inconvenience traffic chaos and delays taking place
7224221 the people of this area are entitled to have their voices heard in relation to these matters and the parade organisers need to begin a genuine process of negotiation with the residents

7224261 oklahoma is subject to the full gamut of weather conditions from ice storms to blazing heat to intense thunderstorms
7224262 the combination of sensors used in the awi awos makes monitoring of this vast meteorological variety possible with their consistent and reliable reporting our awos systems will be key in ensuring air safety in all conditions
7224263 weve developed our awos over years of working closely with both large and small airports
7224264 the technology we have now gives us a better chance than ever before of minimizing the aviation hazards associated with weather
7224265 i think the regulatory process on airport systems need to be revisited in the coming weeks i am going to ask to meet with the members of our congressional delegation to see if something can be done
7224266 our success in the helicopter market is in part due to our ability to collect our own simulator data packages airframe manufactures are frequently not able or willing to offer simulation data packages as result frasca has invested and developed its own flight test capability this allows us to offer a turn key simulation solutions at a very competetive price

7224270 37 jaar maar waarom wilt u dit weten vraagt de vrouw
7224271 thats like talking to somebody about sex whos never had sex
7224272 weve never had sex what would we know its about
7224273 its unfortunate that they havent won and obviously we would like to be the team to change that
7224274 but in the same breath we havent been playing here for 100 years so its not like its a big deal for us anyway
7224275 whats happened in that last 99 years hell ive only been here one year so ill take responsibility for only one
7224276 the whole 100 year thing started as far back as last year and built in the playoffs
7224277 and then right after we lost to the arizona diamondbacks the questions started up again
7224278 isnt there enough pressure we dont need 100 years piled on top too
7224279 if youve been a fan growing up you kind of know what its all about
7224280 as a player its totally different its more of a so what than anything else
7224281 they could lose and theyd be just as happy coming out here drinking beer and going to the bars
7224282 the wounds are still there the fans that are over the top optimistic those are the fly by the night fans the true blue fans hold back because theyve been hurt so many times
7224283 when the fans left the ballpark it was like they were leaving a wake
7224284 it was unbelievable the letdown and the frustration it was an open air morgue
7224285 if we continue to swing the bats like this the rest of the year we aint going to win that many
7224286 id rather be a lovable winner has a nice ring to it doesnt it
7224287 youve just got to keep moving on or else this game will take you down
7224288 up to yesterday 74 applications had been withdrawn after amicable settlement between the parties and authorities
7224289 he said he was being treated well and felt ok
7224290 is in line with beijings promises to the international olympic committee to adhere to the olympic traditions such as free expression outside the sporting venues
7224291 it must be the most cynical interpretation of the freedom to protest that you follow the rules apply five days in advance then are turned away or put under house arrest or worse
7224292 how desperate do you have to be to file a protest that would result in likely detention
7224293 dont just represent themselves in some cases they represent thousands of people who have similar problems
7224294 but being evicted in the middle of the night because a developer paid off a communist party official
7224295 were a sports organization we stay clearly within our role which is to bring sport to host countries
7224296 were not an organization that is best placed or has the capacity to deal with human rights issues
7224297 in china like in other countries to apply for a demonstration you have to obey the law
7224298 that would be a pretty negative legacy if the chinese government had found a way for people to peacefully protest and it had lived up to its promise that could have shown the government the way to deal with the chronic national problem of protests
7224299 this is the single issue that most concerns the chinese government the chinese communist party because it goes to control
7224300 wang xiuying is almost blind and disabled what sort of re education through labor can she serve

7224302 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur
7224303 last year at the all city competition he kexin moved from one team to another and during the process of registering during the move there appeared this age discrepancy
7224304 so it was the appearance of a mistake in the process of transferring teams that the misunderstanding appeared however i can right here accurately say that the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7224305 for those who say its not played enough around the world thats a joke
7224306 look at the far east look at north america look at south america everybody plays it with the exception of europe and africa and im sure the game will grow there like it has everywhere else
7224307 i really do hope it comes back because i want some other american baseball players to have the opportunity that ive had
7224308 it would do good for baseball like every sport to have the stars
7224309 we have lebron james in basketball we had michael jordan scottie pippen and magic johnson on the dream team that trend has continued in basketball and we have all the stars of the nhl so we would love to have as many stars of the major leagues as possible id love to see alex rodriguez
7224310 we dont have to shut down baseball to do it
7224311 but ill go home with a bronze and be happy about it and the memories ill have for the rest of my life being in beijing being at the olympics it was a once in a lifetime opportunity just awesome

7224322 for him to come up with the big hit in the first inning definitely got us out in front and i think that was huge
7224323 he definitely got some big hits for us the first of the year
7224324 sometimes i think we forget how hot chase utley and burrell were they were just absolutely on fire and they were a huge part of our offense
7224325 well see i like it they did a good job the last couple of days as long as were winning thats good enough for me
7224326 we had ups and we had downs just wanted to end on a high moment
7224327 it doesnt make up for it but its a start to the healing process
7224328 we won more medals it just didnt come from where everyone else thought it should come
7224329 a lot of things happened in this olympics that we werent expecting
7224330 but well use that to build on i know next year at the world championships its going to be different
7224331 you are unlikely to see games of this stature ever again
7224332 on one hand people will understand china better with all its challenges they will remain critical on many issues that is their right on the other hand the chinese definitely have experienced that they cannot live in splendid isolation
7224333 you should not look on the international olympic committee to solve the worlds problems
7224334 its the principle of the ioc that it doesnt make comments on countries laws
7224335 i really clicked well with them and they had a great vision for how they saw me fitting into their program
7224336 ive got a lot of confidence especially with the guys hitting out there and playing defense behind me the way they are
7224337 but this year its probably one of my bigger goals just to be able to go out there every five days put up quality starts a lot of innings and to feel good afterward
7224338 thats something ive been able to do if i can keep repeating that every five days ill be able to go through a season healthy
7224339 my main focus is going out there every five days
7224340 its being able to see what my body is capable of doing how it feels in between starts do every exercise and stretch and strengthening program i possibly can thats something ive been able to do
7224341 i want to be able to do that for the remainder of my career because i dont want to have jamie moyer over there trump me
7224342 he probably lost it right off the bat i told our guys to get going
7224343 but were still building and trying to take it day by day
7224344 you try to stay positive but obviously it was frustrating
7224345 but this is a good group of guys who have a lot of heart and we didnt think it would last long
7224346 we havent been swinging the bats the last month or so so its a good sign that its changing
7224347 there are lots of ways to get out of a funk one blooper one bleeder and you get your confidence back
7224348 my mind set is on preventing runs instead of seeing how many runs were scoring
7224349 when we get our big guys hitting it makes it much more fun for us on the bench to watch
7224350 in kenya we have many medals but im glad to have this one
7224351 the most talented team with the least amount of preparation
7224352 other u s teams may have had more chemistry more time to prepare more time to be with one another but as far as putting together 12 players getting together for a week and preparing for the olympics i think its pretty special
7224353 it would be shameful to take all the credit for myself
7224354 i hesitate to use the word survive but to thrive through the transition period of our younger players and still be our leader going into the gold medal game and perform as well as she did i think that really speaks volumes for lisa and her place and her legacy here
7224355 there was never a question that the open player was going to get the ball and take a shot
7224356 there was never a question they were committed to defending which was a problem for us at the world championships
7224357 they put us under the heat and we werent able to handle it
7224358 they are more than ready to take the torch donovan said
7224359 its anticlimatic for me you dont have to suit up you dont have to prepare
7224360 i was out at the silk market three four hours before the game
7224361 any coach should want to coach an olympic team assistant or head coach
7224362 id like to be at the top of my profession
7224363 we probably had three or four days of practices with this particular group of women i guess that speaks to maybe the best talent assembled

7224366 you see tears theyre tears of happiness though we came a long way this tournament
7224367 our whole sideline erupted and you could see the other sideline deflated i think its a great boost for us and you can build off that for sure i wish it was the regular season
7224368 we feel like they can be great returners for us and were anticipating a lot more things from them as the season goes along
7224369 both of those guys are really good returners and thats one of the reasons we brought them in
7224370 desean runs that punt back right before the half so i dont have to go out there and run the two minute drill its just an entire momentum thing you start riding on that kind of stuff something sparks and there you go we have an opportunity to score some points with those two guys and thats something we havent had in a while
7224371 when you see people perform well it certainly runs and radiates throughout the whole team
7224372 i have to say thats the first time ive seen two return touchdowns
7224373 im a very versatile player and i feel like im capable of doing whatever is needed whether its getting open as a receiver or taking punt returns to the house
7224374 coach reid was like get out of here what are you guys doing
7224375 coach reid is cool he was just joking around there are some things you have to do sometimes when youre feeling good and winning things like that happen
7224376 asking the questions no one had the guts to ask before challenging authority and political power fighting the fight few would fight
7224377 sundays thats the only fun part about the nfl to me
7224378 throughout the week its a job in the off season its a job everything that deals with football up until sunday is a job and a business on sundays thats the one time you get to put all that aside and just play the game
7224379 i love the challenge of it the play calling part of it the strategy the whole deal
7224380 its just a different feeling when you put your heart into something that you love doing the only other feeling like that for me is when im in church and getting excited just the energy sometimes i get the chills i feel it before every game
7224381 its all different depending on the time of the game
7224382 for a 1 oclock game everything is happening real fast you have to get up real early and you dont really have time to think about anything you prepare yourself the night before you make sure youre hydrated i really dont like night games because it seems like it takes forever to come around a 1 oclock game you wake up bam bam bam lets do it
7224383 i cant sit here and lie to you and tell you i dont the way we play were an aggressive defense so we have to be on our game at all times some opponents i definitely get a little nervous about its not a lack of confidence or preparation but you always want to go out and do your best and when a lot of pressure is put on you youre the guy that everybody is counting on
7224384 my hands are literally trembling but it has been that way for years for some odd reason ive been able to make an extra point almost feel the same way as a last second field goal its good for the last second field goal i dont think its so good for the extra point
7224385 most of the work is done during the week you exhaust it and then you get to the point where you just go ok im there im done and its over i go back through the game plan one more time sunday morning then drop it for a couple of hours and go over and play
7224386 and were laughing we may be laughing with the receivers and youll see guys with their ipods
7224387 i dont get into all that if the game comes down to a pregame speech youre probably going to get killed after the first hit those guys dont remember any of that stuff you get all that done during the week thats when you start building the bully by the time you get to game day then you just cut it loose
7224388 ive never gone into a game where i just felt like we were in trouble
7224389 i never felt that way i think its because as an offensive lineman you are playing against a better athlete 99 percent of the time and you find a way of beating that guy you just find a way to do it whether its by preparation angles whatever thats kind of the same approach i take with coaching games
7224390 when i get over to the stadium i get into the hot tub get a good stretch and then go out on the field and run around and get acclimated to the weather
7224391 when the officials give their two minute call i head out dodge a couple cheerleaders and try to get a couple more kicks in
7224392 im always the last guy called when they introduce the offense
7224393 you have to understand that youre going to have highs and lows
7224394 when you have highs you dont want to get overly excited and when you have lows you dont want to pull yourself down in the dumps you always have to have confidence that one play can get you back in your rhythm again
7224395 i always feel like my job out there is to get everyone involved in making plays and you want them to feed off making those plays so they bring energy to the huddle
7224396 some guys are good when theyre out of their mind hugh douglas was better that way for me that doesnt work ive got to stay focused on the job at hand blowing up doesnt help yelling at players and screaming at coaches thats not my deal it doesnt work for me and i dont think it works for the guys around me
7224397 i take it to heart because i know how much work we put in and its not a good feeling i usually talk about it for a couple of days me and brian westbrook talk about what we could have done or what we should have done
7224398 the whole next week is so much better with a win
7224399 everyone is in a better mood winning makes the bad things go away its the best kind of medicine you can take
7224400 the sick part of the game is whether you win or lose you go back and you analyze everything
7224401 its a weird deal but you do feel a lot better after wins than you do after losses my wife would probably tell you that after a loss im right back at the novacare complex im not good with that ill go home and try to hang out but im not good with it thats the only time i probably take stuff home
7224402 activities such as poetry story telling oral arts or like chanting things of this nature that involve the language
7224403 we now have an extremely modern road and i know that many of the parents that drop their kids off at school and the church thats serviced here the flow of traffic is tremendous dpw says non arrival of anti skid material delays yona road widening project
7224404 of any team we should know how hard it is to get there and win that game
7224405 i thought he might end up going but i wasnt sure he ever wanted to go
7224406 theres pressures so when he decided to stay obviously i was excited because hes a great kid and a great leader
7224407 i remember when i told him i was coming back
7224408 i firmly believe that if i get hurt that wasnt gods plan for me to play football
7224409 my dad was in and out with wrestling so it wasnt like we went to church every sunday
7224410 i used to pray and read a lot of bible in high school
7224411 freshman year when you dont have mom and dad there all the time youre on your own and maybe you dont read as much i kind of put that on the backburner
7224412 ever since then ive put my trust in a higher authority
7224413 the timing is a bit unfortunate i think we could have celebrated it first and find ways to resolve the issue

7224423 there is concern at the very highest level that kate middleton still does not have a job one royal source told the newspaper
7224424 the queen is keen that the monarchy should lead by example and that the princes and their girlfriends should all be seen to be hard workers
7224425 the queen has made it known that she feels kate should get involved with a charity possibly an animal charity where she can be seen to be doing something proactive and something entirely safe
7224426 it is important that kate isnt seen to be doing anything controversial and she needs to do something completely different from any of the charity work that diana did
7224427 she has quite a bad reputation for being rude when it comes to responding to letters one friend told the newspaper
7224428 she often fails to rsvp when she is asked to attend events she once failed to reply to a wedding invitation from one of williams friends and it didnt go down very well

7224437 our agriculture heritage is so rich and we want to take dayton back to what it used to be in its heyday
7224438 we are trying to come up with a long term vision for job creation
7224439 we interviewed a lot of the business and community leaders in dayton to get the general feel of the community they need jobs and its a very agricultural area so thats why we started looking in the direction of value added foods organic and natural products are a growing industry and its something that can help the area attract smaller processors

7224444 the moderation in growth would be on account of issues like tight monetary policy and some global factors including rising prices of oil and commodities
7224445 the long term growth story remains intact and 2010 11 will see resurgence in growth
7224446 when you play as a striker it is always like this
7224447 when you stop playing it is difficult to come back and play again you need rhythm even more when you are a striker because you need confidence if you dont have confidence you are nothing
7224448 i dont think i am back to my best yet i am still looking to enjoy my football but i am starting to like it again because i am playing more games and the more i play the more i learn how chelsea play and i think the more i play the more confidence i will have

7224460 thirty seven percent of the colleges fleet runs on some form of renewable energy including biodiesel
7224461 using the butter sculpture is a unique way to fuel the esf fleet
7224462 this separates out the triglycerides which will be split in our reactor at esf a process known as transesterification that creates the biodiesel
7224463 dairy farmers are the original environmentalists recycling nutrients and water on their land so it makes sense that this annual tribute to them is itself finding new life in fuel rather than being discarded
7224464 this is a fitting way to mark the sculptures 40th anniversary

7224524 the avalanche occurred at dawn on the french side hitting a group of climbers who were roped together nine are missing and three are injured

7224547 why then they asked did moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away
7224548 in the old testament we find out in malachi that god says he hates divorce in genesis we find out that it was never gods original purpose it was his purpose that a husband and wife should be one flesh as our lord jesus says what god has joined together we have no business putting asunder matthew 19 6
7224549 so they are no longer two but one therefore what god has joined together let man not separate

7224601 the americans have killed that colored fellow whos been stirring up trouble
7224602 the goddamned russians have come across the line into germany

7224606 casi me caigo de la silla observar su esfuerzo con las palabras y la memoria no pod a creerlo ella ten a 75 a os pero siempre pensaba que era una persona que no envejec a sin tiempo y ciento por ciento de hierro
7224607 el contraste se ala fue a n m s sorprendente porque hasta ese momento su memoria era siempre como la web
7224608 he tenido que aprender a tener paciencia una cualidad que admito no es abundante tambi n he tenido que aprender que ten a una enfermedad y que no era nada personal
7224609 debido a su demencia ella no hac a m s que olvidarse que estaba muerto ten a que repetirle la mala noticia una y otra vez

7224617 you know we really are a handsome bunch of fellows
7224618 there are far few vegetables and the spices are all wrong
7224619 now head off to your kitchen and practice the techniques i have taught you off with you now

7224625 the arrls response to his queries though lengthy attempts to address them in detail with toms permission we are releasing both his original e mail and the arrls response in order to get the most accurate and full information out to repeater owners and users as possible it also gives us the opportunity to make sure a couple of other issues relating to the pave paws situation that have arisen are brought to the publics attention
7224626 the balance between not being able to know full technical details of the interference and the testing techniques and the desire need to know information its a tough challenge and while there have been a few errors in identifying call signs because of errors in databases being used by the air force there were actual measurements made of signals identified by the air force testing group
7224627 we will continue to expect the fcc to perform its responsibilities
7224628 i have nothing my neighbors feed me if they have food to share
7224629 we are but angels with one wing it takes two to fly
7224630 flow involves being completely involved in an activity for its own sake the ego falls away time flies every action movement and thought follows inevitably from the previous one like playing jazz your whole being is involved and youre using your skills to the utmost
7224631 simplify tax filings for middle class americans obama will dramatically simplify tax filings so that millions of americans will be able to do their taxes in less than five minutes obama will ensure that the irs uses the information it already gets from banks and employers to give taxpayers the option of pre filled tax forms to verify sign and return experts estimate that the obama proposal will save americans up to 200 million total hours of work and aggravation and up to 2 billion in tax preparer fees
7224632 obama made a huge mistake in not choosing hillary clinton as his running mate biden is part of the existing system and is not a change candidate obamas whole premise of change is now nothing but a joke i would never vote for him and will now actively campaign against him had he chosen hillary clinton i would have worked equally as hard for his campaign
7224633 they need the education and training particularly since more and more women are heads of their households as much or more than anybody else
7224634 hillary got so many damn votes and crushed obama in so many states important to win in nov that not choosing her was a stupid and seemingly vindictive act
7224635 were not promising perfection weve been very careful in that
7224636 what we are promising is that if its properly used it will improve over what they are currently doing
7224637 i dont understand how anybody could think that this is ready for deployment
7224638 sending these instruments into the field in iraq and afghanistan without serious scientific assessment and for use by untrained personnel is a mockery of what we advocated in our report
7224639 the pcass is envisioned more or less like a triage device
7224640 that is its not used as a standalone technology to make final decisions regarding a persons truthfulness there are locals there are iraqis and third country nationals who apply for access to u s military bases to provide support functions and as you might well imagine theres not really a good way to do a background investigation of these individuals and so decisions whether to allow them to come on post and to take these jobs are being based on some pretty imprecise methods primarily interviews and whatever record checks are available so the idea of adding the pcass is to incrementally improve the decisions that are made so that we protect our forces

7224643 i am concerned for the security of our great nation not so much because of any threat from without but because of the insidious forces working from within
7224644 experience hath shewn that even under the best forms of government those entrusted with power have in time and by slow operations perverted it into tyranny
7224645 our country is now taking so steady a course as to show by what road it will pass to destruction to wit by consolidation of power first and then corruption its necessary consequence
7224646 the republican is the only form of government which is not eternally at open or secret war with the rights of mankind
7224647 it is better to be silent and considered a fool than to speak and remove all doubt
7224648 two things are infinite the universe and human stupidity and im not sure about the universe
7224649 i wonder what the winemaker buys half so precious as what he sells

7224662 i cant imagine what happens if this situation is allowed what can happen in another international track and field meet with countries filing after the official timeline
7224663 the one that has to apply the rules is the iaaf

7224666 paying bills will actually hurt the economy because our system depends on the creation of new debt
7224667 its always one thing to be called an olympian youre an olympian for life to be called a gold medallist is i dont know what goes on top of a cherry on a banana split but its on top of that
7224668 after three olympics and us not medalling the only real common theme was that i was the setter as a young athlete in your 20s that starts to wear on you and your self confidence does go down
7224669 when youre young youre always looking for motives to win whether its you hate the other team or you want to be angry at this or you want to jack up with big music for me at this age i just enjoy playing
7224670 i mourn the loss of my father in law greatly my heart aches for my wife and for our family for their loss on the other hand i am extremely proud and happy for my team
7224671 those are the two emotions i have and they are a little bit conflicted obviously i cannot change what happened in either sphere i can just embrace whats occurred and try to deal with it accordingly
7224672 lord remember your church throughout the world make us grow in love together with with
7224673 a child becomes a catholic at baptism their godparents assume the responsibility of speaking for them at the baptism no children do not have a choice in this as with many many things throughout their childhood what to eat what to wear when to sleep etc parents are obligated to do what is best for their children and in the case of catholic parents to bring their children to mass until they are 18
7224674 if the beliefs of religion were real concrete provable facts then it wouldnt be religion it would be science thats why its called having faith
7224675 dont be brainwashed think for yourself and realize that if you dont believe no bolt will strike you down and the earth wont swallow you
7224676 jesus who didnt he mow my lawn with jose yesterday
7224677 the ways of the lord are not comfortable but we were not created for comfort but for greatness for good
7224678 aboard the papal plane pope benedict xvi said on tuesday he was
7224679 it is difficult for me to understand how it was possible that priests betray in this way their mission to these children
7224680 we are deeply ashamed and will do whatever is possible so that this does not happen in the future we will absolutely exclude pedophiles from the sacred ministry
7224681 let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man rather than a fool in his folly
7224682 you shall not make for yourself an idol whether in the form of anything that is in heaven above or that is on the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth
7224683 you shall not bow down to them or worship them for i the lord your god am a jealous god punishing children for the iniquity of parents to the third and the fourth generation of those who reject me
7224684 or i could just be another ignorant one wondering why the majority of roman catholics currently reside in third world countries
7224685 you must eat of my body and drink of my blood otherwise you cannot have life within you
7224686 id suggest you check out the douay rheims bible or if you want to dig back deeper try reading some of the original papyri they are the documents to which the original bibles are written
7224687 men in the next three months you are going to eat drink and breathe football
7224688 receive the holy spirit the sins that you forgive will be forgiven in heaven and those that you keep will also be kept
7224689 your ancestors came to this country with the experience of finding new freedom and opportunity
7224690 to be sure this promise was not experienced by all the inhabitants of this land one thinks of the injustices endured by the native american peoples and by those brought here forcibly from africa as slaves
7224691 no words of mine could describe the pain and harm inflicted by such abuse
7224692 ive been catholic all my life and my dream has always been to see the pope

7224694 no one comes to the father god but by me christ
7224695 your ancestors came to this country with the experience of finding new freedom and opportunity
7224696 to be sure this promise was not experienced by all the inhabitants of this land one thinks of the injustices endured by the native american peoples and by those brought here forcibly from africa as slaves
7224697 alot of african americans are getting help driving new cars and buying expensive clothing
7224698 keep the child abuse secret until which time the statutes of limitations has expired
7224699 he who is without sin among you let him be the first to throw a stone at her
7224700 people who live in glass houses should not throw stones
7224701 oh but thats how you get things done in washington
7224702 what has happened is in the past i am not responsible for the past
7224703 what happened to native americans and blacks happened so long it should be time to get over it and move on
7224704 to be sure this promise was not experienced by all the inhabitants of this land one thinks of the injustices endured by the native american peoples and by those brought here forcibly from africa as slaves
7224705 no one comes to the father god but by me christ
7224706 friday not mentioned the forbidding to marry has led the invitation of many sex deviates to enter the priesthood to hide under the cloak of the church therefore the many sex scandals
7224707 so it was not you who sent me here but god and he has made me a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of egypt
7224708 i was a father to the poor and i searched out the cause of him whom i did not know
7224709 in that day i will call my servant eliakim the son of hilkiah and i will clothe him with a robe and will bind a girdle on him and will commit authority to his hand and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of jerusalem and to the house of judah
7224710 my brothers if one of you has a word of exhortation for the people please speak
7224711 fellow children of israel and you others who are god fearing listen
7224712 i have found david my servant with my holy oil i have anointed him that my hand may be always with him and that my arm may make him strong
7224713 amen amen i say to you no slave is greater than his master
7224714 recieve the holy spirit whose sins you forgivve are forgiven them and whose sins you retain are retained
7224715 friday not mentioned the forbidding to marry has led the invitation of many sex deviates to enter the priesthood to hide under the cloak of the church therefore the many sex scandals
7224716 peter you are the rock upon this rock i will build my church
7224717 repent peter said to them and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ to have your sins forgiven then you will receive the gift of the holy spirit this promise is for you and your children and for all those however far away whom the lord our god calls to himself
7224718 rise up and receive baptism washing away your sins t the invocation of his name
7224719 let the children be do not keep them back from me the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these
7224720 i have suffered more than you so i am closer to truth
7224721 take note of those who hold heterodox opinions on the grace of jesus christ which has come to us and see how contrary their opinions are to the mind of god
7224722 i said holy father you need to know you have a cancer in your flock and i hope you will do something for this problem you have to fix this
7224723 he looked down at the floor and back at me like i know what you mean he took it in emotionally we looked eye to eye
7224724 came to america and they killed our children now the pope is sending priests all over the world who are raping our children
7224725 the pope is not coming to get mixed up in the local political process
7224726 constantine like his father worshiped the unconquered sun his conversion should not be interpreted as an inward experience of grace it was a military matter his comprehension of christian doctrine was never very clear but he was sure that victory in battle lay in the gift of the god of the christians
7224727 constantine himself presided actively guiding the discussions and personally proposed the crucial formula expressing the relation of christ to god in the creed issued by the council of one substance with the father overawed by the emperor the bishops with two exceptions only signed the creed many of them much against their inclination
7224728 constantine had basically no understanding whatsoever of the questions that were being asked in greek theology
7224729 the full development of trinitarianism took place in the west in the scholasticism of the middle ages when an explanation was undertaken in terms of philosophy and psychology
7224730 we worship one god in trinity the father is god the son is god and the holy ghost is god and yet they are not three gods but one god
7224731 the creed was unknown to the eastern church until the 12th century since the 17th century scholars have generally agreed that the athanasian creed was not written by athanasius died 373 but was probably composed in southern france during the 5th century the creeds influence seems to have been primarily in southern france and spain in the 6th and 7th centuries it was used in the liturgy of the church in germany in the 9th century and somewhat later in rome
7224732 the final orthodox definition of the trinity was largely a matter of church politics
7224733 the universe was divided into three regions each of which became the domain of a god anus share was the sky the earth was given to enlil ea became the ruler of the waters together they constituted the triad of the great gods
7224734 it will not come unless the apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness gets revealed
7224735 when i have gone fierce wolves will invade you and will have no mercy on the flock even from your own ranks there will be men coming forward with a travesty of the truth on their lips to induce the disciples to follow them
7224736 the time is sure to come when far from being content with sound teaching people will be avid for the latest novelty and collect themselves a whole series of teachers according to their own tastes and then instead of listening to the truth they will turn to myths
7224737 fourth century trinitarianism did not reflect accurately early christian teaching regarding the nature of god it was on the contrary a deviation from this teaching
7224738 christianity did not destroy paganism it adopted it from egypt came the ideas of a divine trinity
7224739 the trinity was a major preoccupation of egyptian theologians three gods are combined and treated as a single being addressed in the singular in this way the spiritual force of egyptian religion shows a direct link with christian theology
7224740 alexandrian theology as the intermediary between the egyptian religious heritage and christianity
7224741 if paganism was conquered by christianity it is equally true that christianity was corrupted by paganism the pure deism of the first christians was changed by the church of rome into the incomprehensible dogma of the trinity many of the pagan tenets invented by the egyptians and idealized by plato were retained as being worthy of belief
7224742 is a corruption borrowed from the heathen religions and ingrafted on the christian faith
7224743 keep away from these men and let them alone because if this plan or this undertaking is of human origin it will fail but if it is of god you will not be able to overthrow them in that case you may even be found fighting against god
7224744 i heard that you have many fanatics in your church
7224745 fanatics are people who think their piece of pie is the whole pie
7224746 well your holiness do you want to deal with them for us we will send them all to rome
7224747 love your god with all your heart your mind and your soul and love your neighbors as yourselves are the two greatest commandments and all laws are summarized in those two
7224748 thinking their piece of the pie is the whole pie
7224749 the lord has pronounced a curse upon those who take from or add to the scriptures
7224750 but since it would be too long to enumerate in such a volume as this the successions of all the churches we shall confound all those who in whatever manner whether through self satisfaction or vainglory or through blindness and wicked opinion assemble other than where it is proper by pointing out here the successions of the bishops of the greatest and most ancient church known to all founded and organized at rome by the two most glorious apostles peter and paul that church which has the tradition and the faith which comes down to us after having been announced to men by the apostles
7224751 when therefore we have such proofs is it not necessary to seek among others the truth which is easily obtained from the church for the apostles like a rich man in a bank deposited with her most copiously everything which pertains to the truth and everyone who wishes draws from her the drink of life if there should be a dispute over some kind of question ought we not have recourse to the most ancient churches in which the apostles were familiar and draw from them what is clear and certain in regard to that question what if the apostles had not in fact left writings to us would it not be necessary to follow the order of tradition the oral teaching of christ and the twelve which is just as much the word of god as the written scriptures which was handed down to those to whom they entrusted the churches
7224752 rape culture designed by all men to suppress all women
7224753 keep away from these men and let them alone because if this plan or this undertaking is of human origin it will fail but if it is of god you will not be able to overthrow them in that case you may even be found fighting against god
7224754 by a tradition handed down from the apostles which took its origin from the very day of christs resurrection the church celebrates the paschal mystery every seventh day which day is appropriately called the lords day or sunday
7224755 the lords day the day of resurrection the day of christians is our day it is called the lords day because on it the lord rose victorious to the father
7224756 i did not come to destroy the law but to fullfil it
7224757 i did not come to destroy the law but to do away with it
7224758 you see me you see the father the father and i are one
7224759 no one can call jesus lord without the holy spirit
7224760 nobody knows when the end will come not even the son
7224761 1 thessalonians 5 1but of the times and the seasons brethren ye have no need that i write unto you
7224762 dont worry about it rumors of war are permanent whatever jesus said was in general etc
7224763 if mary was a special person then shes in heaven
7224764 no one comes to the father except by me jeus
7224765 both ways would be wrong the first because its a blasphemy because only god can forgive our sins and the second because you could pray directly to the father god of heaven and earth in jesus name and through the holy spirit
7224766 so i now say to you you are peter petros or kepha i e rock and on this rock petra or kepha i will build my church and the gates of hell can never overpower it i will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven
7224767 our apostles knew through our lord jesus christ that there would be strife for the office of bishop for this reason therefore having received perfect knowledge they appointed those who have already been mentioned and afterwards added the further provision that if they should die other approved men should succeed to their ministry our sin will not be small if we eject from the episcopate those who blamelessly and holily offered its sacrifices this can only mean the eucharist blessed are those presbyters who have already finished their course and who have obtained a fruitful and perfect release for they have now no fear that any shall transfer them from the place to which they are appointed
7224768 only pray for me that i may have strength both inward and outward that i may not merely speak but also the will that i may not only be called a christian but may also be found to be one for if i be found to be one then i can also be called one and be deemed faithful even when i am no longer visible in the world i am writing to all the churches and i enjoin all that i am dying willingly for gods sake if only you do not prevent it i beg of you do not do me an untimely kindness allow me to be eaten by the beasts which are my way of reaching to god i am gods wheat and i am to be ground by the teeth of wild beasts so that i may become the pure bread of christ
7224769 i will send you further doctrinal explanations especially if the lord should reveal to me that all of you to a man through grace derived from the name join in the common meeting in one faith and in jesus christ who was the family of david according to the flesh the son of man and the son of god so that you give ear to the bishop and to the presbytery with an undivided mind breaking one bread which is the medicine of immortality the antidote against death enabling us to live forever in jesus christ
7224770 those indeed who belong to god and to jesus christ they are with the bishop and those who repent and come to the unity of the church they too shall be of god and will be living according to jesus christ do not err my brethren if anyone follow a schismatic he will not inherit the kingdom of god if any man walk about with strange doctrine he cannot lie down with the passion take care then to use one eucharist so that whatever you do you do according to god for there is one flesh of our lord jesus christ and one cup in the union of his blood one altar as there is one bishop with the presbytery and my fellow servants the deacons
7224771 take note of those who hold heterodox opinions on the grace of jesus christ which has come to us and see how contrary their opinions are to the mind of god for love they have no care nor for the widow nor for the orphan nor for the distressed nor for those in prison or freed from prison nor for the hungry and thirsty they abstain from the eucharist and from prayer because they do not confess that the eucharist is the flesh of our savior jesus christ flesh which suffered for our sins and which the father in his goodness raised up again they who deny the gift of god are perishing in their disputes
7224772 you must all follow the bishop as jesus christ follows the father and the presbytery as you would the apostles
7224773 we call this food eucharist and no one is permitted to partake of it except one who believes our teaching to be true and who has been washed in the washing which is for the remission of sins and for regeneration and is thereby living as christ has enjoined
7224774 he took from among creation that which is bread and gave thanks saying this is my body matt 26 26 mark 14 22 luke 22 19 1 cor 11 23 24 the cup likewise which is among the creation to which we belong he confessed to be his blood he taught the new sacrifice of the new covenant
7224775 there were sacrifices then sacrifices among the people and there are sacrifices now sacrifices in the church
7224776 but what consistency is there in those who hold that the bread over which thanks have been given is the body of their lord and the cup his blood if they do not acknowledge that he is the son of the creator of the world that is his word through whom the wood bears fruit and the mountains gush forth and the earth gives first the blade then the ear then the full grain of the ear how can they say that the flesh which has been nourished by the body of the lord and by his blood gives way to corruption and does not partake of life let them either change their opinion or else stop offering the things mentioned for thanksgiving is consistent with our opinion and the eucharist confirms our opinion for we offer to him those things which are his declaring in a fit manner the gift and the acceptance of flesh and spirit for as the bread from the earth receiving the invocation of god is no longer common bread but the eucharist consisting of two elements earthly and heavenly so also our bodies when they receive the eucharist are no longer corruptible but have the hope of resurrection into eternity
7224777 if the lord were other than the father how could he rightly take bread which is of the same creation as our own and confess it to be his body and affirm that the mixture in the cup is his blood
7224778 if the body be not saved then in fact neither did the lord redeem us with his blood and neither is the cup of the eucharist the partaking of his blood nor is the bread which we break the partaking of his body as we are his members so too are we nourished by means of created things he himself granting us the creation causing his sun to rise and sending rain as he wishes he has declared the cup a part of creation to be his own blood from which he causes our blood to flow and the bread a part of creation he has established as his own body from which he gives increase to our bodies when therefore the mixed cup and the baked bread receives the word of god and becomes the eucharist the body of christ and from these the substance of our flesh is increased and supported how can they say that the flesh is not capable of receiving the gift of god which is eternal life flesh which is nourished by the body and blood of the lord and is in fact a member of him
7224779 likewise in regard to days of fast many do not think they should be present at the sacrificial prayers because their fast would be broken if they were to receive the body of the lord does the eucharist then obviate a work devoted to god or does it bind it more to god will not your fast be more solemn if in addition you have stood at gods altar the body of the lord having been received and reserved each point is secured both the participation in the sacrifice and the discharge of duty
7224780 eat my flesh he says and drink my blood john 6 55 the lord supplies us with these intimate instruments he delivers over his flesh and pours out his blood and nothing is lacking for the growth of his children o incredible mystery
7224781 the blood of the lord indeed is twofold there is his corporeal blood by which we are redeemed from corruption and his spiritual blood that with which we are anointed that is to say to drink the blood of jesus is to share in his immortality the strength of the word is the spirit just as the blood is the strength of the body similarly as wine is blended with water so is the spirit with man the one the watered wine nourishes in faith while the other the spirit leads us on to immortality the union of both however of the drink and of the word is called the eucharist a praiseworthy and excellent gift those who partake of it in faith are sanctified in body and soul by the will of the father the divine mixture man is mystically united to the spirit and to the word
7224782 formerly there was baptism in an obscure way in the cloud and in the sea now however in full view there is regeneration in water and in the holy spirit
7224783 also in the priest melchisedech we see the sacrament of the sacrifice of the lord prefigured in accord with that to which the divine scriptures testify where it says and melchisedech the king of salem brought out bread and wine for he was a priest of the most high god and he blessed abraham gen 14 18 19 that melchisedech is in fact a type of christ is declared in the psalms by the holy spirit saying to the son as it were from the father before the daystar i begot you you are a priest forever according to the order of melchisedech ps 110 3 4 the order certainly is that which comes from his sacrifice and which comes down from it because melchisedech was a priest of the most high god because he offered bread and because he blessed abraham and who is more a priest of the most high god than our lord jesus christ who when he offered sacrifice to god the father offered the very same which melchisedech had offered namely bread and wine which is in fact his body and blood
7224784 for our savior ate the passover with his disciples on that night celebrated on the fourteenth and the sign of the passover he fulfilled in truth with his disciples for after judas had departed from them he took bread and blessed it and gave it to his disciples and said to them this is my body take eat of this all of you so too he pronounced a blessing upon the wine and said to them this is my blood the new covenant which for many is poured out to the remission of sins in like manner do this in memory of me whenever you gather together matt 26 26 28 mark 14 22 24 luke 22 18 20 1 cor 11 23 25 but the lord was not yet arrested after having spoken thus the lord rose up from the place where he had made the passover and had given his body as food and his blood as drink and he went with his disciples to the place where he was to be arrested but he ate of his own body and drank of his own blood while he was pondering on the dead with his own hands the lord presented his own body to be eaten and before he was crucified he gave his blood as drink
7224785 after the disciples had eaten the new and holy bread and when they understood by faith that they had eaten of christs body christ went on to explain and to given the the whole sacrament
7224786 you shall see the levites bringing loaves and a cup of wine and placing them on the table so long as the prayers of supplication and entreaties have not been made there is only bread and wine but after the great and wonderful prayers have been contemplated then the bread is become the body and the wine the blood of our lord jesus christ let us approach the celebration of the mysteries this bread and this wine so long as the prayers and supplications have not taken place remain simply what they are but after the great prayers and holy supplications have been sent forth the word comes down into the bread and wine and thus is his body confected
7224787 for just as the bread and the wine of the eucharist before the holy invocation of the adorable trinity were simple bread and wine but the invocation having been made the bread becomes the body of christ and the wine the blood of christ so in the same way such foods belonging to the pomp of satan though in their own nature simple become profane by the invoking of demons
7224788 do not therefore regard the bread and the wine as simply that for they are according to the masters declaration the body and blood of christ even though the senses suggest to you the other let faith make you firm do not judge in this matter by taste but be fully assured by the faith not doubting that you have been deemed worthy of the body and blood of christ
7224789 when we speak of the reality of christs nature being in us we would be speaking foolishly and impiously had we not learned it from him for he himself says my flesh is truly food and my blood is truly drink he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood will remain in me and i in him john 6 56 57 as to the reality of his flesh and blood there is no room left for doubt because now both by the declaration of the lord himself and by our own faith it is truly flesh and it is truly blood and these elements bring it about when taken and consumed that we are in christ and christ is in us is this not true let those who deny that jesus christ is true god be free to find these things untrue but he himself is in us through the flesh and we are in him while that which we are with him is in god
7224790 to communicate each day and to partake of the holy body and blood of christ is good and beneficial for he says quite plainly he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life john 6 55 who can doubt that to share continually in life is the same thing as having life abundantly
7224791 the bread again is at first common bread but when the mystery sanctifies it it is called and actually becomes the body of christ so too the mystical oil so too the wine if they are things of little worth before the blessing after the sanctification by the spirit each of them has its own superior operation this same power of the word also makes the priest venerable and honorable separated from the generality of men by the new blessing bestowed upon him yesterday he was but one of the multitude one of the people suddenly he is made a guide a president a teacher of piety an instructor in hidden mysteries
7224792 he did not say this is the symbol of my body and this of my blood but this is my body and my blood matt 26 26 28 teaching us not to look upon the nature of what is set before us but that it is transformed by means of the eucharistic action into flesh and blood
7224793 when you see the lord immolated and lying upon the altar and the priest bent over that sacrifice praying and all the people empurpled by that precious blood can you think that you are still among men and on earth or are you not lifted up to heaven
7224794 do not look upon it as bread do not regard it as wine nor are these excreted into the privy like the rest of foods perish the thought but like wax brought into contact with the fire where nothing is lost and nothing is left over so too the mysteries are thought to be consumed by the substance of the body
7224795 reverence therefore reverence this table of which we are all communicants christ slain for us the sacrificial victim who is placed thereon
7224796 because the bread is one we the many are in one body 1 cor 10 17 why do i say communion he says for we are that very body what is the bread the body of christ what do they become who are partakers therein the body of christ not many bodies but one body for just as the bread consisting of many grains is made one and the grains are no longer evident but still exist though their distinction is not apparent in their conjunction so too are we conjoined to each other and to christ for you are not nourished by one body while someone else is nourished by another body rather all are nourished by the same body
7224797 not in vain was it decreed by the apostles that in the awesome mysteries remembrance should be made of the departed they knew that there was much to gain for them much benefit for when the entire people stands with hands uplifted a priestly assembly and that awesome sacrificial victim is laid out how when we are calling upon god should we not succeed in their defense
7224798 priest and victim therefore are one and the same but the priesthood and the sacrifice are a duty of the human condition for like the lamb he was led to the slaughter and he is a priest according to the order of melchisedech
7224799 my flesh is truly food and my blood is truly drink john 6 56 you hear him speak of his flesh you hear him speak of his blood you know the sacred signs of the lords death and do you worry about his divinity hear his words when he says a spirit has not flesh and bones luke 24 39 as often as we receive the sacramental elements which through the mystery of the sacred prayer are transformed into the flesh and blood of the lord we proclaim the death of the lord
7224800 the flesh and blood of christ is understood in two ways there is either the spiritual and divine way by which he himself said my flesh is truly food and my blood is truly drink john 6 56 and unless you shall have eaten my flesh and drunk my blood you shall not have eternal life john 6 54 or else there is the flesh and blood which was crucified and which was poured out by the soldiers lance
7224801 after the type had been fulfilled by the passover celebration and he had eaten the flesh of the lamb with his apostles he takes bread which strengthens the heart of man and goes on to the true sacrament of the passover so that just as melchisedech the priest of the most high god in prefiguring him made bread and wine an offering he too makes himself manifest in the reality of his own body and blood
7224802 what you see is the bread and the chalice that is what your own eyes report to you but what your faith obliges you to accept is that the bread is the body of christ and the chalice the blood of christ this has been said very briefly which may perhaps be sufficient for faith yet faith does desire instruction how is the bread his body and the chalice or what is in the chalice how is it his blood those elements brethren are called sacraments because in them one thing is seen but another is understood what is seen is the corporeal species but what is understood is the spiritual fruit if then you wish to understand the body of christ hear the apostle speaking to the faithful you however are the body of christ and his members 1 cor 12 27 if therefore you are the body of christ and his members your mystery is presented at the table of the lord you receive your mystery to that which you are you answer amen and by answering you subscribe to it for you hear the body of christ and you answer amen be a member of christs body so that your amen may be the truth
7224803 paul was able to preach the lord jesus christ by means of signs in one way by his letters in another way by the sacrament of christs body and blood for when we speak of the body of christ and of his blood certainly we do not mean pauls speaking nor his parchments nor his ink nor the meaning of the sounds issuing from his tongue nor the signs of letters written on skins by the body and blood of christ we refer only to that which has been received from the fruits of the earth and has been consecrated by the mystical prayer and has been ritually taken for our spiritual health in memory of what the lord suffered for us
7224804 the fact that our fathers of old offered sacrifices with beasts for victims which the present day people of god read about but do not do is to be understood in no way but this that those things signified the things that we do in order to draw near to god and to recommend to our neighbor the same purpose a visible sacrifice therefore is the sacrament that is to say the sacred sign of an invisible sacrifice
7224805 christ is both the priest offering himself and himself the victim he willed that the sacramental sign of this should be the daily sacrifice of the church who since the church is his body and he the head learns to offer herself through him
7224806 one bread and one body we are many 1 cor 10 17 he then that is in the unity of christs body that is in the structured christian membership the sacrament of which body the faithful communicating at the altar are accustomed to receive the same is truly said to eat the body of christ and to drink the blood of christ and consequently heretics and schismatics separated from the unity of this body are able to receive the same sacrament but with no benefit to themselves indeed more to their own harm in that rather than being liberated more slowly they are judgment the more severely for they are not in the bond of peace which is expressed by that sacrament
7224807 my flesh he says is for the life of the world john 6 52 believers know the body of christ if they do not neglect to be the body of christ they can become the body of christ if they will to live by the spirit of christ none lives by the spirit of christ except the body of christ the body of christ cannot live except by the spirit of christ that is why the apostle paul explaining this bread says one bread and one body we are many 1 cor 10 17 o sacrament of piety o sign of unity o bread of love anyone who wants to live has both to live and whence to live let him draw near let him believe let him be embodied that he may be made to live
7224808 this dds only know accusations which probably not even his own only what he heard from other protestants in sunday school
7224809 these things i tell you now though you may not understand them so that you will believe when you see them happening and know that what ive said was true

7224815 woman what do you want from me my hour has not yet come
7224816 now a great sign appeared in heaven a woman robed in the sun standing on the moon and on her head a crown of twelve stars the woman was delivered of a boy the son who was to rule all the nations with an iron scepter

7224818 um die ruhe der touristen und bewohner unserer insel nicht zu gef hrden
7224819 i ended up lying around and tossing and turning a lot its probably not the best way to deal with something like that but i didnt know what else to do
7224820 that didnt do anything either tried to read but i wasnt interested in what kurt vonnegut had to say yesterday or today which is strange because i usually eat it up
7224821 i hate to say that but its been a hard 24 hours i was just stressed out my cortisol levels were through the roof probably and i could just feel that
7224822 if i dont see my name in third im going to i dont know try to disappear
7224823 its hard to see him down on himself like that and its hard to hear him apologizing for everything because he has nothing to apologize for
7224824 but i knew hed bounce back because he always does hes a strong person i always tell him that hes too stressed out and he just needs to take a break but he thrives on the drive and constantly going
7224825 im used to finishing on top and im very fortunate to have that distinction its a little bit too much to ask to do it every single time although thats what i wanted
7224826 its not a failure you shoot for the stars and sometimes you only make it to the moon
7224827 but when i got out of bed this morning i wrote down things i wanted to be
7224828 a lot of young kids have a habit of broadcasting a little too much of their personal information so theyll put right on their profile im 12 years old and my name is whoever
7224829 it essentially says anyone can be anybody on the internet and we try to teach kids to be a little less trusting when they talk to people or a little more aware of the dangers when they are talking to people
7224830 we know personal information is too easily accessible by the criminal element and facebook is one of those areas people post personal information
7224831 we know the criminal element is going to this information to build a portfolio an identity profile and perpetrate crime

7224835 he tried to warm up for this game but he was in too much pain
7224836 im not really one who gets inspiration i dont go to sleep at night and have a dream and then wake up and go aha i know what i have to write next but in the case of this book it did start that way with marianne engel from the moment she arrived she had the look that she had and the name that she had
7224837 this wild haired woman standing in front of a church saying crazy things
7224838 im not given to multiple personalities or anything like that
7224839 it was so strong it was a little unnerving at the beginning but i came to realize that this character was not going to allow me to ignore her and it was going to require a larger space in which she could breathe
7224840 and ive no reason to cheat im on the best horse in the world why would i cheat ive won four five star grands prix this year im in the top 20 in the world i know what ive done all year and i did nothing different for the olympics
7224841 how can a horse test negative all year and then test positive when ive changed nothing thats the question i didnt change anything i did nothing different for the games why change anything when i was doing the same thing all year and winning
7224842 and a lot of international riders have been using the product for the last eight years over half of them i would say you can buy it from every vet in every tack shop at shows all over the world it does not make a lame horse sound it does not make a horse jump higher its a cream that we rub on a horses back to warm him up and make him loose
7224843 but everyones been using it fifteen horses were tested and four were positive if 40 horses were tested then 14 would have tested positive and what would have happened then if you use it equi block over eight years and ive been tested and tested and tested why would you think it was a doping product its not about cheating its got nothing to do with cheating
7224844 do you know how much capsaicin is in the cream well i dont either and yesterday thursday the fei couldnt tell me how much of the substance was in the sample they couldnt say how long he lantinus was positive was it two days in his system was it two hours in his system they couldnt tell me anything
7224845 jesus i dont have a clue about it ive used it on horses backs thats it theres no ifs and buts anymore thats all ive got nothing to do with it i know nothing about it i never want to have anything to do with it
7224846 my mum called me and said reporters were there tormenting them she hasnt slept my father hasnt slept theyre getting hammered by the media its sickening sickening ive got fantastic support from my family my friends my sponsors people in tipperary and from all around the country and then to be slaughtered like that its wrong
7224847 i belonged in the ring that day that was my dream i worked 15 years to get there i didnt go to the olympics hoping to come 17th or 24th or whatever i went there with a realistic chance of a medal and then to be shot down like this
7224848 but whatever sanction they give me will be nothing compared to this to have everything taken away from you the biggest thing you could ever do in this sport is to represent your country at the olympics and to have it taken away from you like that is a total shock
7224849 to thank the people for their support before the olympics and especially for their support now and afterwards life has got to move on
7224850 i went out there on a mission to win a gold medal or a medal of some sort and that was it nothing else

7224854 i came here the day after finishing the martin scorsese
7224855 i just had the flight time between the two filming schedules essentially thats how its working out its pretty well back to back right now
7224856 which is great because the variety of work i can choose to do now is stupendous i can choose to do a film like
7224857 i can also really allow myself to push the parameters of recklessness in my work i dont mean in my discipline but i do mean in the performance although im absolutely word perfect on the text i did allow myself to be a lot looser and more reckless in
7224858 and i can also choose to play a silly little role like in
7224859 for the most part if you look at my cv
7224860 very often im either the moral center of the film or the political center of the film but to be part of the comedic half of the film as in
7224861 so those four films in philadelphia pretty well represent what im allowed to do now what i allow myself to do and the great position i find myself in which is having these wonderful choices so i say yes i can do that for mike myers that would be wonderful as well as of course doing this immensely committed and dedicated role with penelope in elegy
7224862 there was no accent there is no disguise the clothes i wore could have been mine
7224863 its the closest that ive ever been to sounding and looking like me
7224864 but in order to be challenged by the role and feel the danger in playing him i had to get out of my suit of armor i had to get out of my actors disguise tricks so that was a constant challenge hearing my own voice coming out of my head saying those lines
7224865 i think for me the sustained difficulty was not to judge the character nor to sentimentalize him but ushering him up exactly as he is to the audience and let them accept him without any filtering of my judgment
7224866 so i had to be free of any judgment of him positive or negative and as i say to remove as many layers as possible through which to filter him

7224872 i know ben stiller has said that hes making fun of actors not people with disabilities still the movie is geared toward a younger crowd and i fear a lot of those teenagers will leave the theater thinking retard is an ok word to use
7224873 i have a mentally handicapped brother and when we were growing up all i heard was the word retard
7224874 people called him that and other cruel names it was terribly painful for both of us

7224896 i personally improved about five per cent in the gym and 10 per cent in my power output on the track leading up to the games i was improving immensely and beyond what i thought was possible it was exciting leading up to the race in the last few weeks as i knew i was on target for a personal best again
7224897 yeah youre not wrong were the only people now that you can call pikey and things like that on the telly and get away with it takes the piss out of us every week mate
7224898 them houses were the worst houses in the area they were dangerous
7224899 some people dont like you in their area they dont want you there they look on us as were the worst kind of people in this country
7224900 if the government cant control ya then they dont want ya
7224901 they talk about china and all these places theyre just as bad they aint no different they just do it craftily
7224902 theyre killing our culture thats what theyre doing theyre doing it slowly but theyre doing a good job of it
7224903 for many a year i have now been telling you and in the final words of this first course of lectures in which i have been permitted again to resume work among you let me tell you once more and if possible more vehemently that neither sound art policy nor religion can exist in england until neglecting if it must be your own pleasure gardens and pleasure chambers you resolve that the streets which are the habitation of the poor and the fields which are the playgrounds of the children shall be again restored to the rule of the spirits whosoever they are in earth and heaven that ordain and reward with constant and conscious felicity all that is decent and orderly beautiful and pure 16 and this work this restoration of the
7224904 no one will enter the kingdom of god which has come close to us in jesus unless he makes a turnabout and returns to the mentality of his beginning amen i say unto you whoever does not receive the kingdom of god like a child will not enter into it mk 10 15
7224905 for it is quite an inexorable law of this poor human nature of ours that in the development of its healthy infancy it is put by heaven under the absolute necessity of using its imagination as well as its lungs and its legs that it is force to develop its power of invention as a bird its feathers of flight that no toy you can bestow will supersede the pleasure it has in fancying something that isnt there and the most instructive histories you can compile for it of the wonders of the world will never conquer the interest of the tale which a clever child can tell itself concerning the shipwreck of a rose leaf in the shallows of a rivulet
7224906 but mercantile economy the economy of merces or of pay signifies the accumulation in the hands of individuals of legal or moral claim upon or power over the labour of others every such claim implying precisely as much poverty or debt on one side as it implies riches or right on the other
7224907 this robbing the poor because he is poor is especially the mercantile form of theft consisting in talking advantage of a mans necessities in order to obtain his labour or property at a reduced price the ordinary highwaymans opposite form of robbery of the rich because he is rich does not appear to occur so often to the old merchants mind probably because being less profitable and more dangerous than the robbery of the poor it is rarely practised by persons of discretion
7224908 it is impossible to conclude of any given mass of acquired wealth merely by the fact of its existence whether it signifies good or evil to the nation in the midst of which it exists
7224909 in a secluded and mountainous part of stiria there was in old time a valley of the most surprising and luxuriant fertility it was surrounded by steep and rocky mountain peaks which were always covered with snow and from which a number of torrents descended in constant cataracts one of these fell westward over the face of a crag so high that when the sun had set to everything else and all below was darkness his beams still shone full upon this waterfall so that it looked like a shower of gold it was therefore called by the people of the neighborhood the golden river it was strange that none of these streams fell into the valley itself they all descended on the other side of the mountains and wound away through broad plains and by populous cities but the clouds were drawn so constantly to the snowy hills and rested so softly in the circular hollow that in time of drought and heat when all the country round was burnt up there was still rain in the little valley and its crops were so heavy and its hay so high and its apples so red and its grapes so blue and its wine so rich and its honey so sweet that it was a marvel to every one who beheld it and was commonly called the treasure valley
7224910 they killed everything that did not pay for its eating
7224911 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good
7224912 the rise in oil prices affects the mobility of the community and it is critical for action to be taken now
7224913 every citizen really enjoys watching the games they are proud of the culture and all the things that china can present
7224914 when they get nervous things go wrong they were too eager to get things perfect
7224915 not anywhere near in same league as sydney los angeles seoul or atlanta
7224916 in real society you dont see people becoming vocal thats what china has lost and thats very tragic
7224917 theres so much security and control its like some kind of invisible wall
7224918 theres no festival atmosphere or street celebration anywhere that i can see
7224919 our assessment all along has been that the preparations for the games and the holding of the games have actually contributed to a worsening of certain areas of human rights
7224920 in naming my colleague and friend sen joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee sen obama has continued in the best traditions for
7224921 in naming my colleague and friend sen joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee sen obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7224922 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7224923 we now have the ticket thats going to bring the change weve all been hoping for i join all of the members of the senate democratic caucus in congratulating joe biden a great friend a great democrat and now our partys nominee for vice president
7224924 joe biden is the right partner for barack obama his many years of distinguished service to america his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century
7224925 joe biden is a great american and typifies what the democratic party is all about making sure hardworking middle class americans
7224926 joe biden is a great american and typifies what the democratic party is all about making sure hardworking middle class americans get a fair chance he is a good choice that demonstrates how an obama administration will run he will use his solid experience to help guide the change america needs
7224927 the no 1 thing he brings to the ticket is foreign policy experience hes been in the senate for 30 years chaired the foreign relations committee and worked on these issues a long time he travels extensively and has very close relationships with a lot of the key leaders certainly in the whole israel palestine area in the middle east as well as pakistan and europe
7224928 i like joe biden many of us were hopeful that obamas selection would be sen hillary rodham clinton and thats disappointing but again not surprising
7224929 ive worked side by side with joe for 16 years in the u s senate and ive seen his dedication to americas families firsthand joe has always been willing to take on the tough fights and stand up for what is right even when its not always the popular thing to do joe biden spoke up for domestic violence protections for women when no one else was talking about it he fought for the armor our troops need and deserve to do their jobs safely in iraq and he has stood with me time and again to protect our veterans workers and children
7224930 i think compared to the others that we read were on sen obamas list gov tim kaine of virginia and indiana sen evan bayh i think that biden is probably better known nationally
7224931 i think democrats are excited about obama and excited about biden and we feel like we have a ticket that contrasts with george bush and john mccain biden voted for the war but then quickly became one of its most extreme critics and i think joe biden knows how many houses he owns
7224932 six months ago joe biden said barack obama was not ready to be president biden was right then hes right today and washington voters will realize hes right by the november election no vice presidential nominee can make up for obamas lack of experience and judgment especially one whose own words have documented the fact that obama is not ready to be president
7224933 this ends up being i think an incredible partnership and thats what a vice president is the vice president is one heartbeat away but the vice president does what the president of the united states wants to have done it will be a strong team and we will restore the respect of the world i think well be making much better moves overseas than we have made over the last eight years
7224934 i think its a great pick i think it will serve the democrats well in the campaign but more importantly it will serve the country well when hes vice president biden will make any folks who are still wavering probably more likely to get excited and inspired and charged up about sen obama
7224935 i was expecting actually a female maybe because of the hillary situation and i was very shocked that he chose joe biden kind of a rabbit out of a hat because joes been doing this for a long time and so i think its a good chance for joe as well as barack to join forces
7224936 biden just seems to be more of an authentic candidate someone who has kind of been through the mill he might add more experience and balance i just think that they might make a good team together
7224937 seems like a very vanilla safe choice sounds like john kerry all over again with john edwards what a terrible pick that was i would really have liked to see new mexico gov bill richardson if hed have chose richardson i would have voted for him
7224938 i think itll really help the balance will really help that was a good choice on his part go barack i love barack obama
7224939 i thought of hillary as vice president but id never thought of biden because id never heard of him before saturday so i have to start thinking about it now what hes about
7224940 before they sank into the stage to the tune of
7224941 madonna considering shes now 50 is so fit she did a really good job
7224942 i think its always important and this time perhaps its more important
7224943 because of sen mccains age and health history it means succession is more of a concern than it might otherwise be and then there is sen obamas newness to public life and the concerns some people have as to whether hes ready
7224944 with international problems swirling around even as iraq recedes hes got to get his bona fides on national security in order
7224945 we always knew it would be close its always difficult to beat an incumbent
7224946 shaheen spent 700 000 this summer and didnt move her numbers at all
7224947 the clinton people are all with us but we need more from the obama side to win this
7224948 it is striking how pervasive the pro city sensibility is within this generation particularly among its elite
7224949 at a moment in which the massive outward migration of the affluent that characterized the second half of the 20th century is coming to an end
7224950 an america that seemed destined for ever increasing individualization and sprawl is experimenting with new versions of community and sociability
7224951 almost decadent use of space resource consumptive damaging the planet starts to decline
7224952 it was interesting when we screened the film for some of the parents and the kids
7224953 the parents were really moved they had no idea the kids were thinking those thoughts it just goes to show that if you take the time and pay attention and if youre quiet enough you hear things

7224978 children need to feel good about themselves and i encourage parents to encourage their children to be their best
7224979 set the example not only in education but with character be a good citizen were not only teaching skills that apply to education were teaching life skills as well
7224980 some parents may feel intimidated about going to their childs school but they dont need to
7224981 get involved and visit your childs school we really do welcome parents
7224982 for the little ones just let them know school is a great place so they wont be anxious or nervous
7224983 its very helpful when a child believes in themselves and believes the parents believe in them
7224984 parents can help improve attendance grades and the relationship students and teachers have
7224985 be an active participant in the childs education get involved with pto volunteer in the classroom be there and active
7224986 just know teachers are trained and are out to help the student
7224987 when a child has wonderful things happen we let the parents know that
7224988 that way if things dont go well at times we can call and theres much better rapport with the parent
7224989 let us know early if there are potential problems that could effect the childs education
7224990 a lot of the time if we know up front we can do things to assist the child and nip a lot of the problems in the bud
7224991 talk to your children and know their goals and how those goals fit in with the goals of the school
7224992 almost without exception the students who fail are the ones who dont turn in their work or dont get things done on time its not because they dont have the mental capacity its because theyre not doing the work

7225000 there is concern at the very highest level that kate middleton still does not have a job one royal source told the newspaper
7225001 the queen is keen that the monarchy should lead by example and that the princes and their girlfriends should all be seen to be hard workers
7225002 the queen has made it known that she feels kate should get involved with a charity possibly an animal charity where she can be seen to be doing something proactive and something entirely safe
7225003 it is important that kate isnt seen to be doing anything controversial and she needs to do something completely different from any of the charity work that diana did
7225004 she has quite a bad reputation for being rude when it comes to responding to letters one friend told the newspaper
7225005 she often fails to rsvp when she is asked to attend events she once failed to reply to a wedding invitation from one of williams friends and it didnt go down very well

7225011 the people who make your industry so wealthy are so addicted to your product that they will jeopardise their own financial well being and the well being of their families he said
7225012 they will steal from their partners their bosses and their children just to churn money through your machines

7225014 sickened during the mid 1990s when working as a lawyer he would see people lose their personal injury payouts to poker machines including an intellectually impaired man who lost almost 30 000
7225015 addicted and reluctant to wind back poker machine numbers because every year they reaped almost 4 billion in gaming taxes he said
7225016 i also believe there is one more group of poker machine addicts and that group is you the manufacturers the owners the operators he said
7225017 i am not willing to accept that you dont see the harm that you do
7225018 you do yet you choose to do it anyway and that may be the saddest part of this sad sad situation
7225019 agree with pretty much all of what senator xenophon just said im not offended and we need to have this debate

7225028 my concern is for the health and safety of our students
7225029 alcohol use and especially its abuse is a health and safety threat to many university of maryland students just as it is to students at colleges and universities across the country i joined more than 100 other signers of the amethyst initiative to advocate for a serious and sustained discussion of this problem and about all current polices including the 21 year old drinking age that collectively have not come close to controlling the problem
7225030 you always have to be open for debate dialogue and discussion to look at what the outcomes are for any policy or law
7225031 i think that its really interesting that theyre taking some sort of initiative
7225032 a lot of time when theres a problem the first thing they do is to criminalize it then they have to deal with legal procedures i think that will help out with how many students get in trouble for underage drinking
7225033 just changing the drinking age alone will not change the problem
7225034 a lot of our students are first generation college students
7225035 the expectation that you have to make it is significant students carry that and internalize the family expectations to go back and help their families and help themselves
7225036 if you allow young people to drink its like giving them a free pass to go do what you want
7225037 because i started drinking earlier which is irresponsible i am a more responsible drinker as an adult now that im 23 im more aware of how drinking affects me so im less inclined to drink and drive

7225060 we have done our best to embrace peace but the milf started the hostilities by pillaging villages and murdering innocent civilians in mindanao
7225061 now we are implementing the full force of the law and we will arrest those responsible for the traitorous attacks against civilians
7225062 this is a grim scenario and i dont even want to think about it but if the peace talks collapse then there will be war again in mindanao
7225063 the voice of reason is dwarfed by the voice of hatred and prejudice

7225065 tengo casi 40 a os y quiero empezar a leer
7225066 nu voi face schimbari de ce sa schimb echipa pentru ca am pierdut nu cu dinamo va juca acelasi unsprezece care a fost pe teren si la galati iar asta cred ca este o informatie buna pentru dinamo cred ca dupa infrangerea de la galati jucatorii au reactionat bine s au antrenat bine am pierdut la galati pentru ca am jucat mai prost decat adversarii dar am pierdut doar un singur meci nu este nicio problema trebuie sa progresam toata lumea stie capacitatea noastra individuala si colectiva
7225067 sper ca vom face un joc bun si ca vom castiga desi stiu ca va fi dificil pana acum nu simt ca este un meci special cred ca mai am nevoie de inca un an sau doi pentru asta stiu ca este un mare derbi dar eu nu il simt astfel acum voi fi insa la stadion duminica si atunci voi simti aceasta atmosfera dar pentru mine este mai important faptul ca daca vom castiga putem trece peste dinamo in clasament oricum acest meci este greu si pentru rapid si pentru dinamo
7225068 sunt pregatit mergem sa castigam aceasta partida sunt sase puncte puse in joc si vrem sa le luam pe toate sunt pregatit pentru orice in giulesti e un meci important si o batalie mare din ce am vazut la televizor rapid joaca un fotbal bun rapidul este o masina de pase desi suntem pe locul 1 nu jucam fotbalul pe care l am dori asa cum a spus un jucator al meu dinamo este un diesel care porneste mai greu dar cand porneste nu se mai opreste
7225069 el are experienta este un baiat linistit un profesionist care nu creeaza probleme drept dovada a semnat un contract cu clauze asupra meciurilor in care joaca si asta spune multe despre el

7225133 we are getting to the stage of close quarter fighting and that is when we can expect more casualties

7225135 the railway was mined and that was the reason for the explosion

7225137 there were no changes in the position of russian peacekeepers overnight but we are expecting that they will withdraw from poti today
7225138 they were taken under the threat of firearms it was an abduction
7225139 its clear that they were kidnapped because their schedule was to come back to the hotel before 12 in the afternoon and we dont have their whereabouts
7225140 we contacted the place where they were heading but so far they havent seen them
7225141 we are deeply concerned that our son nigel brennan may have gone missing near mogadishu in somalia yesterday
7225142 he is a freelance photographer who arrived in kenya just over a week ago
7225143 we understand that the australian government is making urgent contact with relevant somalian authorities as well as the canadian french and british embassies to help locate nigel
7225144 has deplored the recent killings of innocent victims and the resulting displacement of people in kismayo
7225145 he said that the fighting was to control the port for resource generation and not as portrayed in some places a political or other issue
7225146 kismayo is relatively calm today saturday but residents in janayabdale village reported new clashes in the area
7225147 the remnants of the clan militias and some of their commanders tried to cross janayabdale where they encountered an attack from the islamists several people were injured in the clashes
7225148 there was some sporadic gunfire overnight from friday to saturday but no fighting
7225149 the major battle is over but the militiamen that were dislodged by islamists may try their luck to regain the town
7225150 if your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills
7225151 ladies and gentlemen that is not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7225152 above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7225153 today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency joe biden
7225154 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7225155 he has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters he is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7225156 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president
7225157 he has to make people more comfortable with him as a person
7225158 in fondo anche nelluomo pi laido c una scintilla divina
7225159 im really lost about esther williams work in the movies but if nothing else they had to be extremely dangerous to film
7225160 esther what the hell are you doing we cant keep you in focus at the bottom of the pool were not lit for that
7225161 in the water shes fabulous on dry land shes just a nice girl who should settle down and have children
7225162 how the hell do you make films in a pool
7225163 the same way darryl f zanuck does with sonja henie and ice skates
7225164 who the hell wants to see a picture about some dame that dies
7225165 i owe it all to joe he resurrected me from the dead
7225166 its amazing how people change their minds its a huge shock
7225167 after closing one with a lot of disharmony which was quite difficult and a lot of people had to go elsewhere to play rugby you have to ask why
7225168 they want a stronger player base but how strong is the region going to be and where is it going to be
7225169 when the regions got created in the first place there was big talk of having a region in north wales
7225170 there was so much discussion of where and who was merging but unfortunately for personal reasons people looked after themselves
7225171 the financial backing is another huge element but if its done correctly and for the right reasons then i wish it all the best
7225172 i do think theres a place for the game in north wales because of the catchment area giving opportunities to schoolchildren
7225173 im so glad for shane what hes achieved in his whole rugby career starting from amman united hes just got better and better
7225174 the only thing around here thats been rehearsed is the camera

7225184 alasan bahawa forum itu anti islam tidak berasas selama 50 tahun majlis peguam mempunyai ahli daripada pelbagai kaum dan daripada semua agama ini berpunca daripada unsur unsur ekstremisme yang tidak faham bahawa malaysia merupakan sebuah negara sekular

7225191 anywhere else in the world it would be called compost
7225192 keep coming keep coming keep coming at bat after at bat at bat after at bat
7225193 how can you ever say were out of it there are so many professional players in here with a quiet confidence when things dont go so well nobody dwells on it we bounce right back and keep fighting thats what i love about it here
7225194 weve got three against boston and three against tampa bay coming up
7225195 he knows he has to accept less money jason bobby they both love being here and playing here they want to stay here
7225196 ive been on four teams now and this is a great group of professional players every day i get more comfortable
7225197 i guess were in this red sox yankee rivalry from different sides and going through it for the first time against each other
7225198 i think jason is going to do very well with that organization it seems like hes fitting in right away and hes really contributed im very happy for him
7225199 hes in good position now to make the playoffs but like i said weve got time here to make up ground and get in i dont think youre going to see any one of these guys quitting
7225200 it came down to one of three lefties for the final fifth spot cliff
7225201 hes an amazing story really hes had success in the league before obviously winning 17 games a couple of years ago but hes had some injuries like everyone has at some point and hes needed time to get his game together i guess youd say hes got it together pretty well
7225202 he used to throw in the mid 90s but now hes 89 91 but he can blow that high fastball right by the best of hitters
7225203 he pitches at a good pace throws strikes and never gives in to anyone he just competes about as well as anyone ive ever seen out there
7225204 hes fun to watch hes got a lot of confidence out there on the mound he comes right at you i hope he does it its been a long time for the indians
7225205 sometimes as young pitchers we get ourselves out of our mechanics and we have to be reminded of things its a constant process of making one adjustment after another ive had to do it myself now im trying to come back from this shoulder thing
7225206 im getting excited ive been able to throw off flat ground without any discomfort throwing fastballs and changeups right now and i feel its coming along so i hope it wont be too much longer
7225207 nothing on my part ive never said a word to him i guess its just one of those things
7225208 not recently but we keep in touch hes helped me so much with my pitching and the thought process of pitching its unbelievable id be crazy not to listen to a guy with those credentials whos one of the greatest pitchers ever he taught me a lot when he was in this clubhouse
7225209 i remember talking to his sister out in hawaii and ill never forget she said to me that i reminded her of a young roger i was so flattered by that got a long way to go before im ever that but its nice to hear
7225210 hes a tremendous guy and competitor believe me we understand what we have
7225211 sheets has put together a good season but his history of injuries makes it tough to commit that kind of money to
7225212 therell be a controversial call and people will start saying we have the technology so why dont we use it for other things then pressure will mount on the higher ups and theyll succumb to the public pressure and start using it for everything
7225213 we cant worry about whether the games are home or away
7225214 were in the part of the season where we have to win series doesnt matter where we do it or how we do it
7225215 he played hard every day very very competitive he knew how to dial it up hed dial up the intensity when he needed to a phenomenal hitter and defensive player
7225216 if tom glavines career is over hell end his final season with a 2 4 record and a 5 54 era in his first season in 1987 glavine was 2 4 5 54 not much improvement in 21 years
7225217 as gary sheffield edges closer to 500 homers should he do it for the tigers hell be the first player to reach that milestone while playing for detroit the only other 500 homer guy who ever played for the tigers was eddie mathews who hit the last nine of his 512 homers with detroit
7225218 god must share responsibility with the world for our existence for our ability to be kind and cruel but now that we are here we must accept responsibility for what we do god cannot save us from ourselves or from the rest of the world upon which we depend
7225219 the atmosphere was very tough with so much heat and humidity
7225220 its not every day that you see a game stopped to allow footballers to cool off still the joy of the gold makes up for everything
7225221 our squad is a good group of players good young people many of whom won the world u 20 title the basis of the team for south africa world cup 2010 is this side its easy to play with this group
7225222 hugging real madrids fernando gago here with argentina there are no club colours the cornerstone of our success in our football is the great relationship we all have
7225223 he was in the dressing room with us diego is a phenomenon like any other argentine he greatly enjoyed the moment
7225224 this deal is helpful for us as kallon has great experience of playing in europe and also arab clubs
7225225 we are also trying to sign bahraini mohamed salmeen and godwin attram of ghana
7225226 the avalanche occurred at dawn on the french side hitting a group of climbers who were roped together nine are missing and three are injured
7225227 slikao bih te svakoga dana tako bih zapamtio kako si izgledala svakoga dana svoga zivota
7225228 ne ne izgleda sve vreme se menja svakog dana pomalo da mogu sacuvao bih sve to
7225229 razmisli malo nije to tako kod svakoga zna neki ljudi kao na primer tvoja sestra postaju samo srecniji i srecniji svakoga dana a neki ljudi kao bejla a postaju samo tuzniji i tuzniji a neki ljudi kao ti postaju oboje
7225230 a ta je sa tobom da li si ti najsrecniji i najtuzniji sada nego to si ikada bio
7225231 it has been a long journey since our decision in july 2001 to bring the olympic games to china but there can now be no doubt that we made the right choice
7225232 we are first and foremost an organization devoted to sport but it is sport with a purpose
7225233 the ioc and the olympic games cannot force changes on sovereign nations or solve all the ills of the world but we can and we do contribute to positive change through sport
7225234 the world has learned about china and china has learned about the world and i believe this is something that will have positive effects for the long term
7225235 others will become apparent with time the legacy of these games for china is ultimately up to the chinese people
7225236 it is clear that china has put the bar very high
7225237 so its going to be a challenge for london and all the subsequent games i believe and my hope will be london can even put the bar higher
7225238 we found it unusual that none of these applications have come through
7225239 we heard about these cases and we discussed them with bocog
7225240 the reply we received from the chinese authorities this was an application of chinese law the international olympic committee is not a sovereign organization we have to respect chinese law
7225241 als ik met je mee mag vertel ik het in jouw huis
7225242 je bent een mislukkeling maya een nietsnut je kunt even veel als je bent niets begrijp het dan je bent ongewenst gekomen een neukfout het enige waar je goed voor bent is klusjes doen en dat doe je ook niet goed
7225243 een ongeluk een ngeluk ik zal je eens laten voelen wat een ongeluk is
7225244 the minute i started it started hurting a little bit i started focusing on the hip and i couldnt get away from it i just kept thinking hip hip hip i fell off a little bit and i decided to give it one last hurrah and get back up there but i couldnt do anything my hip just started seizing up when i came around i dont know what lap it was i really didnt see myself coming around again
7225245 i dont know why people think its a gift to be able to find someones weakness and write about it or talk about it or comment about it
7225246 it shouldnt be a matter of finding dervals orourke weakness or finding a weakness in david gillick it should be a matter of finding a strength and telling youngsters this is what you have and this is what you can become she beats herself down and david beats himself down they are professionals and they are looking towards the next step they know the weight they carry from ireland and i think they can handle it but they need support they are two strong heads and they can go a long way
7225247 instead of being train operators we were plumbers painters and mechanics
7225248 this is a first class train theres no amtrak train thats going to give you this kind of service
7225249 its never a good idea to plan your yellowstone trip just as a walk in
7225250 we might do a rain forest walk on one island visit a beautiful beach on another
7225251 the intelligent homosexuals guide to capitalism and socialism with a key to the scriptures
7225252 were not the kind of place that stops everything just because a celebrity comes in
7225253 we get celebrities in here all the time was in here the other day
7225254 oh god i cant write look at it its terrible no one will ever want to read my stuff ill never get published aaaaaarrrrrrrrrgh
7225255 its a lot on us right now but weve got to settle down and learn it and work together
7225256 i guess i got a little taste of it this spring so i had some knowledge of it
7225257 youve got to put in a lot of time with film and with the playbook the terminology is totally different and the plays are totally different its just a whole new world for me but i enjoy it
7225258 since ive been here weve been running around having fun
7225259 this offense offers more options more routes and were getting more people involved
7225260 there are 11 players on the field at one time only five of them are unable to touch the ball all the rest of them are able to
7225261 if you have six athletes on the field that can make big plays why not use them
7225262 i enjoy everything that coach mullens is teaching us im trying to soak it all in or try to at least
7225263 hes a young great mind with a lot of great ideas what he brings to the table will help us out a lot
7225264 im going to have problems no matter what i had problems when i was a young guy with the offense
7225265 it takes time to learn hopefully ill get it done
7225266 i think so we have a lot of great athletes to fill in for them
7225267 theyre definitely hard guys to fill in for they did a lot for the program
7225268 schmitt is definitely a legend reynaud is one of the best wideouts ive ever seen and steve is one of the best backs ive ever seen
7225269 they brought in some good some young guys that are going to step up to the plate
7225270 it was definitely there we just didnt utilize them the way we should have
7225271 arnett and starks definitely bring a deep ball threat as well as a big play threat
7225272 you can throw them a short five yard pass and they can take it to the house at any time i dont think teams will be able to double team anybody because theres so many guys who can make plays
7225273 i work with him after practice or before practice or on the side
7225274 i like to sit back and let coach coach them im not the coach
7225275 we definitely help each other out we all help him out me jarrett brown and bradley starks i guess i enjoyed the first day now its time to work
7225276 its a nice one they did a great job on it it made my mom and dad smile so what more can i ask for
7225277 i think were on track were going to have a pretty good season
7225278 i feel like realistically we can be in the top three in the district
7225279 if we play to our ability from game to game you never know with the ability we have i feel like we could reach that plateau
7225280 most of the girls that i have back got a little bit of playing time or they were regular starters last year
7225281 experience wise we should be better this year than we were at the start of last year
7225282 weve got a good mix all the younger players the freshmen and sophomores are all good athletes
7225283 they have worked in camp the last three years and that has helped develop their playing skills
7225284 that will be a big help to the team and help pick up the slack so the other girls are not playing marathon volleyball all the time i think once they get a little game experience theyll do a really good job
7225285 i think well be better off this year weve got a good group with experience
7225286 with that year of experience they know what to expect theyve been in high pressure situations and they kind of know how to handle pressure moreso than last year
7225287 some of the girls on this team beat carroll county in the jv championship
7225288 they matched up well then hopefully well give a run at it this year
7225289 about 15 or 20 more than what weve traditionally had so were excited about that it speaks well about the recruiting efforts of our assistant coaches
7225290 we really looked at speed in the secondary and at the wide receivers on the offensive line we knew we needed help there and some depth in the defensive line then a couple of quality linebackers as well as a place kicker
7225291 ive been real happy our team came in in excellent shape
7225292 our fitness level has allowed us to get a lot done
7225293 im real pleased with the work our young people did over the summer for division ii student athletes a lot of those guys have jobs they come home at night and go to the gym and run it really takes a lot of intrinsic motivation
7225294 is paying dividends now because weve been spending time getting a lot of work done
7225295 the kids have acclimated very well and bonded im really happy that our older guys have embraced our younger players and brought them into the fold
7225296 its going to be a great opportunity a great challenge for us
7225297 if we can match the intensity and enthusiasm they will bring to the game its going to help us
7225298 is a mark of the respect that all coaches at every level have for him not only is he a classy coach hes a classy gentleman coach sparks is one of the coaching legends
7225299 we played very well from the beginning and certainly pleased with that effort
7225300 i thought they had a lot of good speed and moved the ball well and overall just played better than we did
7225301 we had good possession and we had the advantage of being at home and sleeping in our own beds
7225302 point played at beckley last night against midland trail so they stayed in a hotel and they may have been dragging a little bit so we felt like we might have a chance off the bat to get a goal off of them and we did
7225303 weve got a lot of young players inexperienced players that are playing up front
7225304 we werent as organized as we were in the first half we didnt play as well under pressure as i thought we might we didnt give them a lot to create out of it but they did have a lot of possession in our end for sure
7225305 we got that good run that got us our second goal
7225306 it was just a counter and that sometimes happens if the other team can counter sometimes the team with the possession advantage cant react to that and i actually think we got that advantage against point pleasant
7225307 my big concern with this team has actually been two things
7225308 were not a goal scoring team yet weve had some good opportunities but in terms of finishing thats always an area where were going to have to put some emphasis on
7225309 defensively speaking i think we give a little too much space at the top of the box and the goal they scored was simply that one reason we gave way too much space at the top of the box so well continue to talk about that
7225310 weve still got some things to work on were trying a couple different people in different positions so its going to take a little time for people to get used to playing again
7225311 well have to pick it up and play better and when we do well be fine we didnt pass well we missed a lot of easy shots didnt communicate the way we should
7225312 we like to play a possession game and spread the field
7225313 and in order to do that you have to be able to pass and trap so weve really been working hard on fundamentals
7225314 defensively its just a matter of putting the right people in the right spots and today they werent there
7225315 the guys we did put in did fine it wasnt that they tried hard they worked hard and they played hard but theyre not ready to play on a high school team yet
7225316 hes played actually right back the last two and a half years i guess hes a senior this year and we decided to move him up and give him an opportunity a little bit further forward than hes used to
7225317 just working on a few things midfield depth our outside backs and to score a little bit more offensively we need to work on our finishing some as well we had more opportunities to score than we actually put on the board
7225318 were going to have to work on positioning and work on attitude mainly in terms of seniors stepping up and showing leadership that theyre supposed to be showing
7225319 i really love it here in the bluefield the people are very nice and it is a beautiful city
7225320 if i need to come back next year im looking forward to coming back
7225321 i really enjoyed it if there was one place i would like to come back it would be here
7225322 were thankful to go out with a win especially with that type of game that moreland pitched and then barajas comes in and does an outstanding job
7225323 its tough to see here sometimes with the signs but i got a good 1 0 pitch on the outside corner
7225324 i stayed back on it and lifted it a little bit but i hit it good enough to get it out
7225325 there are a lot of good players in this league and i just got in so im excited it is quite an honor
7225326 its encouraging after we got beat twice and the way we got beat and to play the type of game we played tonight
7225327 it was very encouraging that shows you that the kids never died and the kids never quit
7225328 i feel pretty good about the season it was hard in the beginning they were learning but in the end we were right there and showing how they play the game it is very encouraging to see how they have worked and the things they do in the field
7225329 it would be nice to win three more games and finish with a good note
7225330 but im proud of the players that we have and the coaching staff and the city i really enjoyed it
7225331 i loved it the people are really nice its a good start to your career i liked it a lot
7225332 im excited hopefully every day ill keep improving and make it to the big leagues one day
7225333 finally we got that run i tip my hat off to our kids and the princeton rays also for playing a hell of a ball game
7225334 we found a way to tie it up but then we had several opportunities to win it and we didnt execute and that part of it is frustrating
7225335 theyve showed character all year but character and lack of execution thats two different things and lack of executions what hurt us tonight
7225336 we had a base on balls bunted him over and get him in
7225337 so thats what it was base on balls bunt him over and get him in and thats how we want to win it
7225338 certainly there was a lot of talent now some of these guys that were not playing as much or playing every day now theyre rising to the occasion and my hats off to them
7225339 we work every day on offense defense pitching base running bunting the whole gambit
7225340 we work every day on those things and theyve all gotten better i think
7225341 they came out and they worked they didnt complain they had fun working and they got better and theres going to be a lot of guys on this club probably playing in the big leagues in a few years
7225342 with a brilliant smile and the early facial creases of happy dissipation he was known for being cranky curious passive aggressive and most of all persnickety
7225343 of course i want to start but so does sean
7225344 thats our goal going into the season but every day all i can do is come out here and perform at a high level
7225345 it was very hard i didnt expect to play last year i expected to redshirt coming in but things changed and i got a chance to get on the field
7225346 it was kind of like me learning on the go actually
7225347 it was a good experience and i hope i can just build off of that for this year
7225348 i think all of us would like to resolve it its just easier when youve got your starter and youve got your backup
7225349 life is easier but i think we are dealing with a complicated situation
7225350 the best thing that i like is it is two really good quarterbacks that are two really good people and good kids and smart were going to get it worked out were going to get it figured out
7225351 sometimes it was a little overwhelming but i didnt turn down the opportunity to play because im a football player and i love to play football
7225352 i learned on the go and this year im just trying to go out there and be better than i was last year
7225353 it was pretty good but you could tell i was young on the field at times as far as reading defenses and maybe running too quick instead of going through the checkdowns
7225354 but thats what i have been working on and i feel like i am improving now
7225355 then whatever it takes to help the team win im with it
7225356 the young guys at wide receiver and running back they are looking very good in practice
7225357 thats their goal to show the coaches they can perform on this level as well as the players
7225358 sometimes last year i didnt because of the defenses but ive been working hard this offseason to go out there and read the defenses and i feel like i have improved
7225359 its going good hes pushing me and im pushing him and at the same time im in competition with myself too
7225360 i just want to go out there and be the best quarterback that i can be
7225361 i just have to respect the system day in and day out and just try to take care of the football be accurate and make good decisions
7225362 i think that is a possibility that has been talked about among the staff
7225363 i think that is one of the possibilities but it has never been said that this is what we need to do
7225364 im just out trying to become the best quarterback in preseason and just go out there and work hard every day
7225365 its hard to answer that since i havent thought about that they havent brought that up to me
7225366 were going to have a very good team he said
7225367 we just have to go out there and work hard in practice and everyone stay on the same page
7225368 i improved a lot last year in terms of reading defenses and that was my goal in the offseason
7225369 i feel more comfortable as a signal caller to go out there and perform at a high level
7225370 that was my goal to come out here and feel more relaxed behind the center and take control of what is going on
7225371 its going to be so much fun to be out there again and to compete
7225372 itll be harder to come back next season weve got to be a whole lot better than we were last year if we want to compete like we did last year so itll be a task
7225373 if we want to be like last years team weve got to really work hard
7225374 ive got to step in and replace them to try to do a better job than they did or as good a job as they did
7225375 they gave it their all so i need to give it my all every time i go out
7225376 as soon as i heard i was going to be able to come back it really hit hard
7225377 to be a teammate and help everybody out and never lead em wrong
7225378 its my last year when i was a freshman i was just anxious to get on the field when the time finally comes its mind blowing its amazing
7225379 i just enjoyed being out there just whenever i could it was just a good time being out there with the team
7225380 has really nice hands and could definitely help will cole in getting open and catching the ball when he gets it there
7225381 everything is on the money he doesnt lead you too far or jam you too close
7225382 since he didnt get to play last year but i think hes smart enough to pick it up pretty quick
7225383 as you go on its a whole lot easier you see where the defense lines up and everything you just watch their feet and cut off of their feet if they take a step wrong you can capitalize on their mistakes then get open as fast as you can
7225384 little things like hurdle drills and cone drills just to get our feet right
7225385 every time we did it we felt like we get a little bit better we go out the next day and try to get better than we were the day before weve worked pretty hard
7225386 theres so many things you have to do to get ready for the game
7225387 just play your game and try to out play your defender
7225388 ever since i was little i used to watch them play
7225389 its probably like the biggest family we can have i love it i wouldnt trade it for anything
7225390 le commandant a dit quil y avait un contre temps il a pr sent ses excuses dit quil y avait un voyant allum et quun technicien allait lexaminer
7225391 we know people are going to drive we want them in their cars for less time
7225392 i believe in local control i come from a city council
7225393 but traffic congestion doesnt all of a sudden go from bad to good when you cross any particular city or county border and air quality and climate challenges dont respect artificial boundaries
7225394 most people dont want to live in dense urban cores most people want a little elbow room they want a yard for their children to play in
7225395 they want a little grass a little garden a little breathing room they can call their own and who the hell are you to tell people they cant
7225396 its either going to be some regulation restricting your behavior or some huge tax and neither of those is politically popular
7225397 so theres been a big debate about whether we can do this all with carrots
7225398 ive spent most of my 30 year career fighting regional planning and regional government
7225399 but what you are seeing here is a pretty thoughtful approach there are incentives for in fill development and building along transportation corridors and in the end it doesnt prevent development in suburban areas it just says there are standards and it has to be done well
7225400 he has the foreign policy chops that obama lacks and the experience inside d c he clearly could be commander in chief if need be
7225401 he speaks to blue collar america and the ivy league in strategy and foreign relations
7225402 you sense a tougher environment a more restricted environment a more pessimistic environment its a moment of turmoil i think
7225403 with shootings you need to get there quick enough to get the shot of them loading him into the ambulance
7225404 unless hes dead on arrival if hes d o a youve got all the time in the world

7225416 when you go to trial and somebody is actually not guilty and the jury finds them not guilty theres sort of no better feeling because you were vindicated and due process was vindicated

7225418 they did what theyre supposed to do making sure dangerous people are held accountable but when we win its not whats supposed to happen its because somewhere along the way the police or prosecutors got it wrong and were the vigilant check against the system

7225448 the olympic games in beijing were a huge success for adidas both in china and around the world
7225449 we were clearly the leading brand in terms of visibility across all sports during the games we provided first class service and exciting products that were especially made for beijing we also made our mark in communication with our campaign together in 2008 impossible is nothing that won the first ever golden lion for china at the cannes festival so the olympic games in beijing brought us another giant step closer to our mission to be the leading sports brand in the world
7225450 we already used the uefa euro 2008 tm in austria and switzerland to grow our football leadership and now we demonstrated at the olympic games again that we are the brand that is at the core of sports with the platform of the beijing 2008 olympic games brand adidas has become market leader in china in terms of revenues market share and brand perception
7225451 our olympic journey will continue as we have already started to prepare for the london 2012 olympic games where adidas will again be official sportswear partner
7225452 we are well on track to reach our sales target of more than eur 1 billion for the adidas group in china by 2010
7225453 these successful olympic games in beijing will leave a legacy for sport in china and for all brands of our group therefore i am convinced that we will continue to achieve dynamic growth in this market for the years to come
7225454 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7225455 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7225456 i know hes working on the speech because theyre phoning in edits every few hours

7225476 its always been a moderate number only a handful of cases
7225477 its not like were carrying nuclear weapons and these surfboards arent much heavier than a carry on
7225478 its ridiculous when youre having to pay more for your board than the price of your airline ticket
7225479 you have to skip nice meals and give up that nice bottle of tequila
7225480 there are handling costs associated with surfboards that we have to account for
7225481 they just think that its an extra pain on their employees that the boards take up extra space on their planes and that we make up a small percentage of its passengers
7225482 you know i just realized im going to be paying 360 to take my board along
7225483 a lot of hip hoppers are saying things that obama cant exactly endorse
7225484 so we wanted to make sure the video reached beyond black america and could be something everyone could appreciate
7225485 we wanted to reach a broader audience and feature the lyrics verbatim throughout the video in case some people are not used to digesting hip hop lyrics
7225486 we wanted a video that united people working for a cause
7225487 its a chance to reflect on a remarkable fact that what you have here is a repository for all the knowledge and all the people for all time

7225501 afghanistan takes every necessary measure to avoid and stop such tragic accidents happening in the future
7225502 coalition forces are aware of allegations that the engagement in the shindand district of herat province friday may have resulted in civilian casualties
7225503 all allegations of civilian casualties are taken very seriously coalition forces make every effort to prevent the injury or
7225504 almost without exception i find these defendants to be honestly amazed at the seriousness of their conduct as far as the system is concerned
7225505 many of the defendants have no previous criminal history and have been productive members of the community and often there are complex psychological reasons why they are interested in child pornography
7225506 the images themselves are truly horrible even passive viewers of such material help to make its production profitable
7225507 the practical effect of possessing child pornography is to stimulate the market in child pornography which encourages things such as child torture and rape
7225508 and i didnt look at them or dwell on them very much
7225509 what we know is very limited to a very skewed sample because these are just the guys who get caught
7225510 as a prosecutor i dont really need to know why
7225511 for every one of these people we take down were intervening in preventing child abuse
7225512 the elements are very easy for the government to prove
7225513 there is nothing about prosecuting the bernie wards of the world that is going to stop the east european exploiters from marketing this stuff
7225514 weve gone from being characterized as environmental terrorists to being embraced this is like falling down a rabbit hole i feel like alice in wonderland
7225515 its been unbelievable to me that this has happened but this isnt my victory i just sat on guard
7225516 we hope to duplicate the things we do well one county away

7225521 but at the end of the day green bay had to do whats best for the future of the team
7225522 i was a player so i know what im talking about because i lived it
7225523 i thought wes was wrong for calling out asante wes broke the rules you dont hate on another player saying this guy is chasing money and not a championship when you wes just signed a 5 year 18 million dollar contract yourself i mean to say hes chasing paper and not a championship asante has two championship rings already wes is the one with no championship ring
7225524 i made my comments because i felt the point he was trying to make about the black athlete was totally false and the timing for such an article was inappropriate

7225554 i dont want to lose it i want to win things for the club i want to get experience here i want to play for arsenal

7225557 i am happy with everything my number four playing for arsenal in centre midfield and giving 100 every every game

7225566 the column originated after getting an e mail from a friend i have known for 30 years
7225567 he cannot figure out why people would choose to leave places like the town of tonawanda and amherst for clarence or wheatfield
7225568 i kept trying to come up with an answer for him but i kept coming back to the fact that this is a continuation of a migration that our forefathers and foremothers started in the 40s and 50s
7225569 to me that sounds like the clarence and wheatfield of today and i wonder then what that means for the first ring suburbs of today in 50 years
7225570 the tonawanda that my grandparents moved to in 1953 had fields everywhere a lack of services like garbage pickup and mail delivery

7225582 new york the state sent 3 000 letters in july to companies given tax breaks in exchange for promises to invest money and create jobs the letters went to companies that failed to meet 60 of their goals

7225606 ah doctor are you just going to stand there and be rude or are you going to introduce me to your friend here
7225607 can we save the introductions and the dating plans until later
7225608 there are actually more pressing issues at this time like how in the world he got here
7225609 well jack turns out that good old jake here happens to be from the same parallel universe where one rose tyler resides i first met him when mickey rose and i went to a parallel world then mickey stayed with jake to liberate the world from the cybermen and then we met up again at canary wharf that was shortly before i lost rose
7225610 captain jack also happens to be an old companion of rose and myself rose and i met him in 1941 i looked a lot different back then and the ex time agent joined us after we saved the world from a bomb and some gas masked zombies
7225611 now jake tell me how in the world you got here because i told rose at bad wolf bay that if i tried to cross the void into her universe that the two universes would collapse so i am curious how you can get through without disrupting the time circuit and have all the universes collapsing into the void
7225612 ever since the torchwood on our planet opened we have been finding ways to advance our technology to be more environmentally friendly it took years but we finally got it right a week ago right before the daleks decided to cross the void into your world i know what you are thinking doctor so now we can cross the void without having any problems with other worlds or the void courtesy of torchwoods weapons experts mickey smith and me
7225613 so it sounds like you guys have been doing better than i thought you know i was a bit wrong about you lot i guess torchwood can do more good than evil
7225614 unfortunately we can only travel for a short time and only one or two people can go at a time once i go back we have to close the rift the only way it can open again is if another alien opens it we do not have the power to do that it usually takes two weeks for it to open up again
7225615 the only real bad thing about all this is that the only spot where the rift can open is either in our cardiff or where you closed the breach in your torchwood in london doctor the likelihood of our part of the rift opening is slim the aliens seem to favor cardiff
7225616 i have an extra disc that i was going to use for the dalek but since jack still wants to work on it i cant take it back i will stay here with it until jack is done with his research i was wondering if you would like to take the disk instead
7225617 i dont want to take it jake i could rip a hole in the universe it is easy for you but what about me i am a time lord the energy i have is different from yours especially after i took the time vortex out of rose i am sorry i cant do it
7225618 doctor look at me now listen i know you do not care about the void i mean it is a big deal to you but not now you are just afraid of seeing rose again that everything changed and she does not love you anymore knowing her i think she does still love you
7225619 doctor she has never forgotten you there has never been anyone else since you believe me her mother tried to get her to move on but she refused she never got back with mickey either the only man she loves is you she has been wanting for this moment for years what do you say
7225620 you are right i was just so afraid of losing rose she has waited long enough my thoughts have only been on her for the last year and a half i even drove martha crazy because of it and i am sorry for that every night when i close my eyes i see her on that beach crying and i wished i could hug her i know she loves me but i never told her the truth about how i feel about her now is the time i am going jake give me the disk
7225621 the only other thing is that you have to be and the same spot where exactly you want to go in order for it to work
7225622 ah doctor are you just going to stand there and be rude or are you going to introduce me to your friend here
7225623 ah doctor are you just going to stand there and be rude or are you going to introduce me to your friend here
7225624 just let me take my foot out of my mouth and say i support barack america
7225625 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
7225626 the world can say with gratification we have made a correct decision by selecting beijing and china as the olympic host
7225627 we couldnt be more pleased with the chinese peoples presentation of the games
7225628 whether its the village or the venues theyve done an incredible job
7225629 it is indeed the most precious gift the chinese nation has presented to the world
7225630 they keep talking about rivalries we might have one now
7225631 he did it at milwaukee and hes done it a few other times its just his normal fashion thats fine ive grown to know that now
7225632 to pass a guy to hit him getting into the corners chatters his very tires is what he did i tried to get him back but i thought better of it and tried to pull down and pass him back but i didnt have a good enough car to stick and denny hamlin got to his outside and he got by me and then i had to battle with him towards the end we were as clean as could be of course but just one other dude we had a problem with
7225633 a real smart racer explained it to me this way after he wrecked me and i was really mad
7225634 he said i just had to look at your rear bumper and decide would you do this to me and you had before so it was a real simple decision
7225635 earlier this year we had a nationwide race and kyle was a lot faster than me and he went ahead and got to my back bumper of my car and sent me up the racetrack
7225636 so thats the way it went and thats the decision i made and id do it again
7225637 one thought can overcome time and distance just one thought

7225643 entgegen der entschlie ung des sterreichischen nationalrates internationale rechtsschritte einzuleiten hat die sterreichische bundesregierung bis heute keinerlei rechtlichen schritte gesetzt
7225644 wenn die bundesregierung die sterreichische bev lkerung im stich l sst m ssen verantwortungsbewusste parteien wie die fp eben selbst initiativ werden
7225645 die aktuelle bedrohung der sterreichischen bev lkerung und ganz europas durch das atomkraftwerk temelin die h ufung der st rf lle die nach wie vor offenen sicherheitspunkte und das fehlen rechtsverbindlicher sicherheits normen haben die fp deshalb im interesse der sterreichischen bev lkerung veranlasst jetzt zu handeln

7225647 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7225648 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7225649 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7225650 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7225651 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7225652 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7225653 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7225654 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7225655 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7225656 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7225657 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7225658 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7225659 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7225660 hes in the clear and was very happy about it
7225661 we gave him a self testing kit to take away
7225662 id love to replicate this in india as well im sure theyve many such initiatives in india but if i can link up and do something more why not
7225663 if a face and a voice can help spread the message then im more than happy to be that face and voice
7225664 some right honourable and honourable members will have diabetes but will be unaware of it
7225665 whats the point of being nervous its done and gone its not like a stage performance where i can improve on the performance mumbai meri jaan and maan gaye mughall e azam are very different films am i proud of both films im happy with both films i was even proud of a few of my three scenes in shaurya
7225666 i got to do comedy again in maan gaye mughall e azam this is an entirely new genre for me the director sanjay chhel comes from gujarati theatre i play a ghazal singer haldi hassan with a roving eye slightly sleazy and though i sing quite well i left it to the professional playback singers to sing for me im only an actor
7225667 but genres are not relevant i leave it to the pundits to segregate by genre i go by what the script requires from me for me acting is cathartic it gives me a chance to be and do what i wouldnt in real life we actors are a blessed lot acting gives me a chance to recognise myself
7225668 i play an unemployed guy he can apply himself to work but chooses not to and hangs around with younger boys in an irani caf its all very interestingly done
7225669 i used to joke about me being a garlanded photograph in sarkar raj that didnt happen
7225670 sarkar was one of my most popular films im quite happy with the work i do im getting to live my life the way i do
7225671 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7225672 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7225673 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7225674 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7225675 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7225676 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7225677 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7225678 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7225679 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7225680 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7225681 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7225682 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7225683 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7225684 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7225685 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7225686 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7225687 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7225688 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7225689 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7225690 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7225691 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7225692 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7225693 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7225694 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7225695 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7225696 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7225697 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7225698 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7225699 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7225700 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7225701 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7225702 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7225703 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7225704 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7225705 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7225706 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7225707 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7225708 throughout the 12 months of the crisis it is difficult to avoid the impression that the fed is too close to the financial markets and leading financial institutions and too responsive to their special pleadings to make the right decisions for the economy as a whole
7225709 if no countervailing actions are taken what would be perceived as an implicit expansion of the safety net could exacerbate the problem of too big to fail possibly resulting in excessive risk taking and yet greater systemic risk in the future
7225710 it creates a troubling perception when washington policy makers appear to be hitting the fast forward button when major institutions are on the line but are between the pause and the slow motion button when massive home foreclosures are on the line
7225711 market participants failed to soundly manage measure and disclose risks with ignorance greed or hubris playing their customary roles
7225712 the alarms of the financial sector have been overstated the real economy has slowed down but is not yet in severe difficulty
7225713 it headed off disaster the history of financial crises tells you the economy doesnt get sick the next week it takes a while
7225714 madonna considering shes now 50 is so fit she did a really good job
7225715 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7225716 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7225717 ich frage mich ob eine firma mit 4 000 besch ftigten keine abteilung hat die in der lage ist sich mit den angeh rigen von neun mitarbeitern in kontakt zu setzen die bei einem arbeitsunfall ums leben gekommen sind
7225718 viele von uns erhielten vor dem absturz von unseren verwandten sms aus dem flugzeug dass mit der maschine etwas nicht stimmte
7225719 the two new cyber shot phones that we have announced today share certain characteristics both phones place ease of use and best in class picture quality at the heart of their designs
7225720 yet both appeal to different audiences one is engineered to let you take more pictures in more places and the other is designed to look as stunning as the pictures it takes
7225721 viele deutsche obstbauern und landwirte verspritzen illegale und hochgef hrliche pestizide weil es einfach billiger ist

7225725 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7225726 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7225727 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7225728 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7225729 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7225730 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto

7225734 if you go back 12 months brand china was in tremendous difficulties with toxic toys and a number of other issues
7225735 chinas amazing haul of gold medals has mirrored its spectacular economic growth to signal to the world that china has truly arrived
7225736 from the grandeur of the opening ceremony to the self assured way chinese athletes expected to win in so many events china exceeded every expectation
7225737 companies like li ning that are looking to expand globally are going to use the olympics as a chance to do that
7225738 it wont do much to lift growth as the chinese economy is so huge
7225739 before the games people were anticipating a business boom in tourism benefiting hotels airlines and local restaurants
7225740 now its becoming clear that the impact wasnt all that big i dont think industries like that are likely to benefit greatly from one month of olympics and paralympics
7225741 analysing the one off macroeconomic impact or the economics of the games is not really an issue of such great importance
7225742 if we look at how much more water we will need for food and how much more for biomass for energy going forward it is quite worrying
7225743 almost every increase in water used in agriculture will affect water availability for other uses including that needed to keep ecosystems healthy and resilient in the face of change and perturbation
7225744 it might be environmentally reasonable to withdraw maybe 6 000 cubic kilometres but if we withdraw more water it would be at a very high environmental cost because we need water to flush the system and for different ecosystem services
7225745 by 2030 the same amount of energy that we produce today with fossil fuels will have to come from biomass
7225746 meet food demands by 2050 if we have a much more efficient use of water that does not include the water we need for all that biomass
7225747 we are at the end of the road when it comes to irrigation because all the water available in rivers and so on has already been now more or less used up
7225748 in a large part of africa if you look at the total rainfall throughout the year the amount is usually enough to grow many crops
7225749 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7225750 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7225751 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7225752 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7225753 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7225754 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

7225756 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7225757 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7225758 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7225759 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7225760 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7225761 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7225762 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7225763 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7225764 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7225765 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7225766 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7225767 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7225768 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7225769 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre

7225771 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7225772 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7225773 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
7225774 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
7225775 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
7225776 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
7225777 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
7225778 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
7225779 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
7225780 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
7225781 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
7225782 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
7225783 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
7225784 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
7225785 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
7225786 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
7225787 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
7225788 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
7225789 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen

7225811 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7225812 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7225813 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7225814 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7225815 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7225816 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7225817 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
7225818 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7225819 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior

7225822 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7225823 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7225824 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7225825 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7225826 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7225827 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7225828 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7225829 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
7225830 love can make you weep can make you run for cover wounds that spread so deep
7225831 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7225832 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7225833 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7225834 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7225835 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7225836 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7225837 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7225838 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7225839 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7225840 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7225841 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7225842 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

7225845 mi ni a no fue expulsada yo fui quien decidi sacarla de ese lugar porque estaba siendo maltratada ella no puede tener ese maltrato me la traje a la casa y busqu una profesora para que me le diera clases privadas no quiero que mi nieta regrese al colegio salzburgo mi decisi n es ponerla en otro colegio
7225846 los funcionarios que laboran en el colegio no pueden sacar antojadizamente a ning n ni o sin embargo hacen las cosas para que la gente se retire por su gusto aparentemente eso es lo que ha pasado con la ni a que vive con vih no le dicen andate pero le hacen la vida imposible para que se vaya de la escuela
7225847 the main thing is not to be intimidated very few streets will be closed there are dozens of activities the public can participate in you just need to approach them from ways other than speer boulevard
7225848 thats not that much we have that many people downtown all the time and no one even notices thats the size of a rockies game
7225849 im sure some people have used the dnc as an excuse to get away but most people who stay will find it to be one of the most fascinating weekends denver has ever had
7225850 if you go a couple blocks out you can save money
7225851 it might be like a broncos game where you would want to leave a little more time for coming into the city but there are so many ways to get into denver
7225852 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo

7225875 im an east end boy and im proud that its happening in london i was very proud to be involved in the first place bringing it back to england and to london its going to generate so much interest in sport and kids are already getting excited about it
7225876 we have seen what the chinese have done here and im sure we will better that without a doubt
7225877 today weve beaten one of the very best teams in the league and maybe shown the pedigree to prove that we do belong here the last 15 20 minutes there was an element of panic stations as we had some players who had to go off because of injury or tiredness and it wasnt easy for the ones who came on the arsenal had three or four big lads flying around up front so it was a case of hanging on
7225878 i believe that fulham started stronger than us they had a corner that we didnt defend very well in the second half it was all arsenal if you look at the number of shots on goal but they were sharp motivated and we didnt create enough chances to win but i think it is harsh to lose the game when you want to play at the top you have to start the game differently from how we did with more personality and authority
7225879 i was very pleased with the first 15 minutes but after that we did not play well then they scored and we had to throw people forward last season we drew far too many games at anfield but this time we have sent out a message that in such situations we can win the game we have winners here
7225880 that was hard to take the players are heartbroken in the dressing room we deserved more we certainly deserved a point their equaliser was a freak and we should have been able to see out the game even at 1 1 but i have told them that they can leave anfield with their heads high
7225881 the idea is that we do want michael to stay all of us we have just got to get to the point where we have got an agreement and thats got to be right for both parties i know he wants to stay i know he likes it here really likes it here and i have made it absolutely clear i want him to it will run its course i think we are pretty close but we will find out on wednesday and we will see
7225882 a fair result is neither here nor there it doesnt matter whether if it was fair or not we had an opportunity to get something from that game today and i feel win the game but we didnt take that
7225883 he didnt play because he wasnt in the right condition this is what he told me before the game when i spoke to him so he did not play well have to wait and see tomorrow sunday well speak to the player and then well make a decision on his future its a situation that is very personal there are players able to play under these circumstances and others whose head is not right berbatov is in the latter category well have a meeting with the player and clarify a few points and see if there is a decision to be made
7225884 we wont be dancing in the streets in sunderland for beating tottenham away from home well have a cup of tea and sandwich as normal
7225885 well enjoy this but we know it will be difficult and we need the supporters to stick with us we have to make sure that defeats dont get us down and that we dont labour over them i dont want to single any players out as everyone played a part and thats what will get us through this season
7225886 theyre very dangerous but we thought we had resolved the problems of coping with them we had one last long throw to deal with and whether it was a bit of luck or what the ball ended up in our net one thing you shouldnt do in the last minute of a game is if you cant win it then at least dont lose it
7225887 generally we controlled the match for long spells and with lots of possession that is a positive for us and i cannot remember them having a shot apart from their two goals but we were probably guilty of not creating enough real chances despite seeing a lot of the ball
7225888 they were much better than us in the first half and maybe they were a bit unlucky not to be in front but the first goal of the game was always going to be the important one and i am glad that we got it we did not do too much else in the game apart from get our goals but we defended well to stay in it
7225889 players have been away on international duty and the performance wasnt the best i had about an hour with my players yesterday and i think it showed in the second half we played into hulls hands they deserved their point

7225896 we have 100 opening in 2010 there will be very strong pressure from parents and local authorities to maintain that rate

7225898 individuals who embark on the heroic journey of expatriation take a risk but the rewards are a positive life and career enhancing experience employers looking to stimulate interest in international working should be mindful that the willingness to expatriate is a key element in the hero or heroines psyche that needs to be nurtured

7225903 i am determined to work with the football associations and the olympic committee to ensure that when we come to 2012 we have a mens football team and we have a womens football team playing
7225904 this is a spectacular own goal for brown he is out of touch with the overwhelming views of football supporters throughout the uk
7225905 all the national supporters groups oppose this move and see it as a threat to the status of their nations to field independent football squads
7225906 as the olympic games in beijing draw to a close i have been particularly impressed by the british and commonwealth athletes who have taken part in this memorable competition and who have contributed so much to the spirit of these remarkable games in the various disciplines
7225907 to all the participants and to everyone who has supported them so well i send my warmest congratulations
7225908 as a nation we now look forward to holding the olympic games in london in 2012
7225909 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success
7225910 the towers are completely down now and the demolition has been carried out as planned the site is now completely safe
7225911 one tower came down completely as expected and then there was about one third of the other one left standing but angled away from the viaduct as the demolition experts designed it to
7225912 people were looking at it saying are we supposed to be able to see it but the demolition crew went to the site and manipulated what remained so that it has now completely come down

7225919 ill take care of you as soon as i give daddy what he needs
7225920 hey my spouse just walked in i have to go ill call you later
7225921 my grandmother used to say if intimacy leaves the marriage it will go somewhere else
7225922 i crossed over the fifth tee and steve and hunter mahan were standing there and i looked at their board and steve was 12 under and i was only six under
7225923 so i really felt i was out there playing for position
7225924 luckily i got some birdies going after i dropped a shot on 12 and next thing i knew i was tied for the lead standing on the 17th tee
7225925 so im very very surprised to be sitting here right next to the lead right now
7225926 i made two stupid plays in a row at 11 and 12
7225927 really the one at 12 was one of the dumbest plays i ever made trying to do what i did out of the rough there and from that point on it was a struggle to get in
7225928 four back not a good day today it wasnt what i was looking for
7225929 and now israel what does god ask from you other than to fear him
7225930 well all that god really wants is that you fear him
7225931 they went off so quickly in the first kilometre i deliberately backed off the pace
7225932 im a little disappointed not to make the top 20 but you can only do what you can maybe i didnt get my pacing quite right but im satisfied with the run
7225933 and you will serve there in exile gods the works of mans hands of wood and stone gods which cannot see nor hear nor eat nor smell
7225934 and you will serve there the nations that worship idols
7225935 when you have children and have grown old in the land and you will make a statue and do that which is evil in the eyes of hashem your god you will be swiftly removed from the land and hashem will disperse you among the nations and you will serve there man made gods
7225936 jeff shouldnt we stay out of this part of the lake and stick to where the counselors can see us
7225937 aw dont be such a worry wart anyway what could possibly
7225938 were gonna capsize were gonna capsize where are the life jackets
7225939 i guess i kinda um lost my cool out there but you were the man how did you ever pull that off
7225940 you know jeff im not really sure i just wasnt that scared could be cuz when i was younger i had pretty bad asthma and couldnt do a lot of stuff one of the games i used to play to keep myself occupied was called what would you do if i used to make up really scary dangerous situations and id have to figure out how to get out of them this was nothing compared to being charged by a pack of elephants in a rainstorm
7225941 abby says that when i get braces the doctor will ask me what my favorite color is and if i dont say blue everyone knows alyssas favorite color is pink the doctor will give me the head gear with the screws in my neck
7225942 acepten aplicar la jornada intensiva durante los meses de verano
7225943 no es comprensible que el ministerio de sanidad haya lanzado una campa a preventiva sobre los peligros del sol mientras la autoridad laboral no media entre la patronal y los sindicatos a la hora de aplicar la jornada intensiva
7225944 dejen a sus trabajadores comenzar la jornada unas horas antes para evitar las de m s calor
7225945 se llevar a un poco mejor el calor si se trabajara desde las siete de la ma ana hasta las tres de la tarde
7225946 la gente no viene hasta que la sensaci n de calor baja pero hasta que llega ese momento siempre me pregunto qu hago aqu bajo este sol de justicia
7225947 pasas mucho calor porque tienes que estar m s pendiente de los ba istas que del sol adem s el uniforme que llevamos es muy grueso y no ayuda mucho
7225948 he will be praised and beloved and others will desire to emulate him this person has sanctified the almighty
7225949 tell everyone to get on and let those in the back pass up their money or cartisiot
7225950 i set before you a blessing and a curse the blessing if you obey the commandments of god the curse if you do not and you follow other gods
7225951 you will slaughter animals according to the manner i god have prescribed
7225952 you are a nation consecrated to god your lord god has chosen you from all nations on the face of the earth to be his own special nation deut 14 1 2
7225953 see i am placing before you this day a blessing and a curse the blessing if you will listen to the commandments of the almighty which i am commanding you this day and the curse if you do not listen to the almightys commandments
7225954 he is speaking to everyone else here i dont have to take what he says seriously since he is not really directing his words to me
7225955 hi boss hey i wanna talk to you about something
7225956 hey just go ahead and email those 623 people his social security while youre at it
7225957 the joint venture is a great way for us to approach the us market
7225958 i cannot disclose their details now but towards the end of this year we expect to announce our next big project
7225959 we are very selective in taking up new projects and do not feel that the company has entered the market very late the real estate market in dubai has been booming we are bullish and believe that it will remain strong and healthy at least for the short to medium term based on our assessment
7225960 people who are waiting for this and sitting on the sidelines are actually missing a lot of opportunity the market is healthy both in terms of the real estate developers who are looking at exactly what they want to develop as well as the end users becoming smarter in selecting projects and are looking at the reputation of the developers they are becoming more selective in terms of acquiring assets and are making sure they know that they are buying from the right people
7225961 the idea behind this is to maintain the companys target and to take into account the inflation rising costs of building materials etc which we are seeing currently happening in the country
7225962 our idea of releasing stock for sale on an incremental basis will allow us to accommodate these potential increases at a later stage when we sell them this will not only give us more room to adjust the price spikes but will also allow us to maintain our sales growth
7225963 actually we have seen major laws being introduced in the dubai real estate sector ever since the freehold law was first announced in 2002 this has created more maturity in the market and has given international investors more confidence to invest in dubai the strata law which has been in the making for a while is now functional and people who own units can actually register their units with the land department
7225964 all of the gb team has achieved way beyond their expectations we knew it was possible but youve still got to do it first
7225965 as for carrying the flag its going to be a once in a lifetime experience a fantastic end to an amazing few weeks
7225966 helped us all stay motivated throughout the whole of the games
7225967 rebecca romero is the first british woman athlete ever to take an olympic medal in two different sports and of course chris hoy is great britains first triple gold medallist in an olympics since 1908
7225968 if you have that teacher who has been trained gone through all the background checks and is perfectly capable of carrying a concealed weapon that would be the logical thing to do
7225969 the sad thing is we live in a society where we never know for sure when something like thats going to happen and we have our second amendment rights so they teachers are entitled to protect themselves as well as their students
7225970 you couldnt have a starker contrast between the multiple layers of check and balances at cbs and a guy sitting in his living room in his pajamas writing
7225971 we boycotted the grammys when they didnt televise the rap categories in the fresh prince days but now not acknowledging other music we should be doing songs with country rock and pop stars
7225972 i wanted to work with bruce springsteen on this album but it didnt happen because of a scheduling conflict
7225973 white kids who make rock music with hip hop roots
7225974 now hip hop needs to do it instead of keeping hip hop locked into one thing we should be blowing it up and expanding it thats the way you stay at the top and the music remains dominant
7225975 for every solution there is also a new set of problems
7225976 for the bread of god is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world
7225977 the son of man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many
7225978 if billy graham were to win 10 000 people a day to christ it would still take him twelve hundred years to win the world to christ at todays population but suppose i were to lead you to the savior and then spend a year building deep into your life and then we both turn around and do the same for someone else the following year if the chain remaind unbroken the enormous power of multiplication would kick in and the world would be won to christ in an incredibly short thirty two years
7225979 you cant change america when you supported george bushs policies 95 of the time
7225980 i say with every fiber of my being i believe we cannot as a nation stand for four more years of this
7225981 joe wont just make a good vice president he will make a great one
7225982 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are firmly rooted in the middle class
7225983 he has stared down dictators and spoken out for american cops and firefighters
7225984 hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7225985 reports provided courtesy of the smithsonians global volcanism program and the us geological surveys volcano hazards program
7225986 report provided courtesy of the smithsonians global volcanism program and the us geological surveys volcano hazards program
7225987 you should try to nab them abdur rahman and bangla bhai
7225988 they us government have shown happiness and satisfaction at the steps we have taken against terrorism
7225989 they have given them training time and again and have proposed some more courses the us also has offered to train our trainers
7225990 they did not mention anything specifically but said we should give attention to aspects of human rights
7225991 bangladesh is not only a functioning democracy but also a role model for muslim countries
7225992 rocca was very appreciative of the governments anti militant crackdown and hoped that this effort would continue
7225993 we were urged to continue our efforts to increase bilateral trade and cooperation in economic and other areas
7225994 when there isnt any money left you dont buy la cucina
7225995 a month ago we were ranked the best wine in israel by the american magazine wine spectator
7225996 it is quite problematic for someone who is self employed
7225997 uncompromised wine making modest pricing and community involvement in the project
7225998 we went to the graduate exhibition asking for the years best student
7225999 a 39 year old tried to hit on me i dont feel like it
7226000 mitt f rsta skolminne var krig nu m ste jag uppleva ett till
7226001 we are continuing the operation encircling a 5km area and we hope to arrest them if they are in the circle
7226002 about 1 000 members of police rab and bdr cordoned off five kilometres of area and started searching each house for the militants
7226003 we did not have specific information about their presence but we had information from a reliable source that 2 3 of jmbs majlish e shura members are present there the two may or may not be among them
7226004 in fact we do not know exactly what other majlish e shura members except bangla bhai and abdur rahman look like we are working to be sure of the identity of the arrestees
7226005 no one with suspicious attitude or identity can escape our dragnet there
7226006 we hope to get the result by tomorrow friday noon
7226007 we have taken the information seriously and are conducting the operation we cannot undermine any such information
7226008 we warn that individuals who violate covenants of chastity who abuse spouse or offspring or who fail to fulfill family responsibilities will one day stand accountable before god further
7226009 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7226010 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7226011 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7226012 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7226013 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7226014 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7226015 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7226016 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7226017 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7226018 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7226019 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7226020 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7226021 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7226022 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7226023 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7226024 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7226025 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7226026 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7226027 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7226028 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7226029 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7226030 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7226031 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7226032 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7226033 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7226034 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7226035 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7226036 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7226037 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7226038 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7226039 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7226040 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7226041 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7226042 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7226043 this is a planning took where all things are going
7226044 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7226045 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7226046 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7226047 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7226048 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7226049 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7226050 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7226051 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7226052 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7226053 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7226054 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7226055 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7226056 its amazing how people change their minds its a huge shock
7226057 after closing one with a lot of disharmony which was quite difficult and a lot of people had to go elsewhere to play rugby you have to ask why
7226058 they want a stronger player base but how strong is the region going to be and where is it going to be
7226059 when the regions got created in the first place there was big talk of having a region in north wales
7226060 there was so much discussion of where and who was merging but unfortunately for personal reasons people looked after themselves
7226061 the financial backing is another huge element but if its done correctly and for the right reasons then i wish it all the best
7226062 i do think theres a place for the game in north wales because of the catchment area giving opportunities to schoolchildren
7226063 im so glad for shane what hes achieved in his whole rugby career starting from amman united hes just got better and better
7226064 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7226065 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7226066 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7226067 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7226068 whew as a concerned citizen and mccain supporter i am relieved and encouraged by the biden selection
7226069 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7226070 obviously joe and i have been on different philosophical sides but we have been i consider him a good friend and good man
7226071 he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7226072 i love my mothers roast and my plate is always filled twice as high as everyone elses
7226073 for me being british is about politeness kindness and fair play you see it in the athletes village people from other countries can be quite aggressive pushing in queues and not treating each other with respect but our lot are the complete opposite and i love that
7226074 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7226075 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7226076 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7226077 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7226078 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7226079 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7226080 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7226081 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7226082 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7226083 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7226084 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7226085 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7226086 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7226087 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7226088 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7226089 ich war jetzt grad im internet und habe da eine bestattung f r 449 euro rausgesucht da hab ich auch schon angerufen
7226090 ja und die haben mich nach der postleitzahl gefragt und mir einen bestatter genannt
7226091 das machen die so viele von den anbietern im internet f hren gar keine eigenen bestattungen durch sondern vermitteln blo an vertragspartner weiter
7226092 ist mir klar aber der bestatter den ich da dran hatte der hat gleich gesagt da das f r 449 euro nur ohne beratung geht ohne trauerfeier die wollen meinen vater montag in der fr h abholen und gleich zum krematorium bringen das w r dann aber wie das grab im ausland
7226093 k nnen sie meinen vater abholen ich will n mlich gar keine feuerbestattung der soll ein ganz normales grab bekommen mit trauerfeier und pfarrer und allem pipapo
7226094 das k nnen wir selbstverst ndlich alles organisieren kein problem
7226095 wir m ssten uns dann nur mal zusammensetzen und alles durchsprechen
7226096 ja wie jetzt ist bei ihnen denn eine beratung inklusive
7226097 toll und das alles f r 449 euro da bin ich aber froh da ich doch noch bei ihnen angerufen habe
7226098 moment f r 449 euro geht das nat rlich nicht sie wollen eine erdbestattung mit grab und trauerfeier da wird das schon ein st ck teurer
7226099 was das ist ja eine unversch mtheit da k dern sie mich mit einem niedrigen preis und wenn man dann nachhakt wird es doch viel teurer
7226100 i had heard that it was by far above and beyond other communities
7226101 like taking a spoonful of water out of the pacific ocean
7226102 it doesnt really mean a lot to raise fares because at the end of the day its not an efficient service
7226103 eventually id like to see these monies allocated to something thats successful
7226104 most of these people theyre handicapped not to the extent that theyd take metro mobility but to the extent that they cant walk a couple blocks to the bus
7226105 it has had a huge impact on our driver program just a huge impact
7226106 get more bang for our tax money and maybe even serve more people in the city
7226107 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7226108 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7226109 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7226110 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7226111 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7226112 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7226113 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7226114 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7226115 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7226116 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7226117 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7226118 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7226119 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7226120 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7226121 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7226122 dont tell me about the law the law is anything i write on a scrap of paper
7226123 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7226124 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7226125 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7226126 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7226127 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7226128 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7226129 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7226130 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7226131 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7226132 fuck you kevin two of my friends died while getting their heads shaven
7226133 the real question is will it keep crazy fanboys from shooting up your school
7226134 cut it cut her of we going for a commercial break now
7226135 collections attorneys are an amazing group of professionals who take their job seriously
7226136 its not a matter of who can harass the consumer most its a matter of you owe money to our client that you should pay back
7226137 i was assuming id go to court go before a judge with all this documentation
7226138 many people tell us they didnt understand when they received the summons and complaint they didnt realize they were being sued
7226139 debt collectors have an uncanny ability to come up with the right address once it comes time to get the money but they have a hard time coming up with the right address when it comes time to serve the summons and complaint
7226140 its not as if all of a sudden out of the blue collectors say hey mr
7226141 i dont know what else we can do other than to make the default judgment papers pink
7226142 that back end piece where the burden is shifting back to the consumer to prove the money is exempt is unfair to the consumer
7226143 collectors need to adhere to the consumer protection laws that are already on the books in minnesota to ensure that they do not freeze or garnish exempt funds
7226144 it makes no sense to me that you can use the power of the state of minnesota to sue somebody without paying a fee to us and bringing it into court
7226145 our civil judges in hennepin county carry way over the national caseload
7226146 once youre in danger of losing money i think the court should be on top of it i think they need to stop rubber stamping
7226147 we are aware of the challenges that some of our families across the state are facing due to the rising energy costs
7226148 the west virginia utility assistance program will help many families lift a burden as the winter season approaches i commend dollar energy fund our utility companies businesses and other community organizations for stepping up and joining an effort that will certainly help our citizens have quality of life that they deserve
7226149 it is designed to help defray costs for people who are having difficult times with their heating bill
7226150 the salvation army offices would be the place to apply but it wont begin until oct 1
7226151 nato is enhancing its military presence on the black sea under the pretext of providing humanitarian aid
7226152 i apologize for this long letter i didnt have time to shorten it
7226153 we come more and more to see through the follies and vanities of the world and to appreciate the real values we load ourselves up with so many false burdens our complex civilization breeds in us so many false or artificial wants that we become separated from the real sources of our strength and health as by a gulf

7226156 we come more and more to see through the follies and vanities of the world and to appreciate the real values we load ourselves up with so many false burdens our complex civilization breeds in us so many false or artificial wants that we become separated from the real sources of our strength and health as by a gulf

7226162 according to very preliminary information a train carrying fuel exploded on the railway which we think was mined
7226163 we should find out first how big the fire is and how soon it will be extinguished in order to assess the damage

7226166 there is concern at the very highest level that kate middleton still does not have a job one royal source told the newspaper
7226167 the queen is keen that the monarchy should lead by example and that the princes and their girlfriends should all be seen to be hard workers
7226168 the queen has made it known that she feels kate should get involved with a charity possibly an animal charity where she can be seen to be doing something proactive and something entirely safe
7226169 it is important that kate isnt seen to be doing anything controversial and she needs to do something completely different from any of the charity work that diana did
7226170 she has quite a bad reputation for being rude when it comes to responding to letters one friend told the newspaper
7226171 she often fails to rsvp when she is asked to attend events she once failed to reply to a wedding invitation from one of williams friends and it didnt go down very well
7226172 you know i have been through a hell the likes of which most people cannot imagine i lost over seventy relatives in a little over a year including seven children my wife and parents i have no place to mourn them no grave they are ashes in the skies over europe and i have no idea
7226173 but this son at least this son i know why he died he died so we could have a home for the jewish people in the land of israel and he has a grave here on mount herzl in jerusalem and that is not a reason to cry it is a reason to sing

7226319 eat as usual my prince and on the appointed day i will give you the golden deer
7226320 go to the palace prince and here is your golden deer
7226321 on the seventh day from now at sunrise you must bring me the rice that never becomes stale and meat that is ever fresh
7226322 eat as usual sleep as usual and on the appointed day i will give you the rice and meat
7226323 my lord go to the palace now and here is your rice and meat
7226324 this is positively the last task on the seventh day from now at sunrise bring me the most beautiful woman on this earth
7226325 our wives are very beautiful and we will bring them one of us is sure to be declared heir and our good for nothing brother will be nowhere this time
7226326 dear princess i must go and look for the most beautiful woman on this earth my brothers will bring their wives for they are really beautiful but i will find someone who is more beautiful
7226327 eat as usual sleep as usual and you can take me to the palace on the appointed day surely i shall be declared to be the most beautiful woman
7226328 all right princess i will take you with me on the appointed day
7226329 my lord i must make myself beautiful so please wait outside and call me when it is nearly time to go

7226332 perhaps real world climate sensitivity is very much below the ipccs estimates perhaps therefore there is no climate crisis at all the correct policy approach to a non problem is to have the courage to do nothing
7226333 i was impressed by an hour long academic lecture which criticized claims about global warming and explained the implications of the physics of radiative transfer for climate change
7226334 to me the value of this paper lies in its dispassionate but ruthlessly clear exposition or rather expos of the ipccs method of evaluating climate sensitivity the detailed arguments in this paper and indeed in a large number of other scientific papers point up extensive errors including numerous projection errors of climate models as well as misleading statements by the ipcc consequently there are no rational grounds for believing either the ipcc or any other claims of dangerous anthropogenic global warming
7226335 was 0 3 f cooler than the 1901 2000 average

7226394 were not in a position given their weapons and equipment to defend themselves effectively or even to resist
7226395 the deployment of air power despite the regrettable civilian casualties can be seen as militarily appropriate to the operation
7226396 this is the worst game of the tournament for us serbia won today because they were the team with the most experience

7226400 they came here with no experience and they have won eight medals no gold i know but nobody was expecting more than one or two medals from us
7226401 when boxers like triple olympic champion teofilo stevenson used to fight for cuba it was completely different because they had a lot of experience in international competitions
7226402 during the entire fight i felt like i had the advantage
7226403 i had no doubts at all that i would win even though the win was by two points only
7226404 tomorrow ill go back home and tell my family all my stories from the competition
7226405 the injury continued from then so when i was fighting today i felt a lot of pain in my shoulder and i decided not to force myself
7226406 i am very happy because i won the first boxing gold medal for my country
7226407 after a very good preparation i wanted to deliver to the spectators but i did not expect that my opponent would get injured
7226408 i told myself when you get gold you can cry
7226409 two journalists a man and a woman were kidnapped at the camps
7226410 they were taking pictures of the refugees but armed men surrounded them and took them away along with other somali men
7226411 we are appalled by this cruel abduction and call for the immediate release of our colleagues who are being held captive because of their noble work for somali people
7226412 people automatically assume that if it weakens the hazards go down with it but in the case of rainfall its not a function of wind speed
7226413 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather
7226414 people automatically assume that if it weakens the hazards go down with it but in the case of rainfall its not a function of wind speed

7226421 stuarts not happy about it at all he had no idea
7226422 stuart rang me and asked if i was a member of the bnp he was shocked when i told him i was he didnt know before we have this rule never to talk politics in the family
7226423 i back the bnps manifesto completely the country is full up theres too many people here its time to shut the door on immigrants immigration isnt helping crime rates drop thats for sure i served in the army it was about fighting communism because communists stopped freedom of speech im fighting for the same with the bnp this is a christian country islam is not compatible with this country
7226424 ive met nick about half a dozen times at red white and blue i complimented him on the hog roast hed brought a pig from his farm for us to eat his wife jackie cooked us a roast dinner
7226425 stuart and i are very close and i see him regularly ive always supported his football career and im proud of what hes achieved ive been to his house in wiltshire to see him and his wife many times the last time i saw him was at a concert by the police in hyde park a few months ago it was a great day out
7226426 quite a few of us feel he has brought disgrace on the regiment we are disgusted by his drift into right wing politics dennis used to be in charge of a very multi racial platoon and seemed comfortable with the ethnic mix so no one can understand why he got mixed up with the bnp
7226427 my brothers views are his own and do not in any way reflect mine
7226428 stuart is very keen to stress that his brothers beliefs are not what he is all about he wants to distance himself completely
7226429 we have to prepare for the world coming to the arctic
7226430 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off it is imminent
7226431 the evidence is overwhelming that there is a specialized system dedicated to processing faces and not other objects

7226441 i think alabamas economic development strategy is quite sound because it is based on a balance of both large medium and small projects and because it touches all parts of the state

7226446 employees use swearing on a continuous basis but not necessarily in a negative abusive manner
7226447 we hope that this study will serve not only to acknowledge the part that swearing plays in our work and our lives but also to indicate that leaders sometimes need to think differently and be open to intriguing ideas
7226448 managers need to understand how their staff feel about swearing the challenge is to master the art of knowing when to turn a blind eye to communication that does not meet their own standards
7226449 i want you to chase your tail around your ass for a few weeks until such time as i tell you that we should have pursued the safe boring uninspired route we always take so please start over and have it on my desk before you leave tonight
7226450 oops i never showed this to my boss but she just saw it and she says it needs to be changed significantly but we cant move our deadline and we cant give you any more money and you should probably just get on your knees and lick my boots for even getting you in with a company of our stature thanks bye
7226451 conditions have already become so parlous that a failure to put in place a purposeful and internally consistent reform programme will lead to serious supply disruptions that will eventually put the overall economy into considerable difficulties there is a clear capacity for the financial stress arising out of the petroleum sector to cause serious and lasting damage to the indian economy and the finance of the government unless dealt with in an urgent and cohesive fashion

7226454 hi excuse me have you seen a cat that looks like this
7226455 no i havent someone came here this morning looking for her
7226456 oh yeah that was me sorry did we wake you
7226457 oh no i was already up wow thats a neat looking cat
7226458 yeah you cant really miss her if she walks by here take a flyer it has my phone numbers on it
7226459 did i tell you i lost bear about a month ago to the coyotes
7226460 yeah i had to let him out everyday if i didnt hed piss on everything
7226461 yeah those coyotes are relentless ive shot three of them fuckers already but they just keep comin
7226462 but i dont mean to scare you umas probably just out there being a cat i bet she comes back
7226463 well you guys dont have to stay any longer ill keep looking thanks for coming
7226464 is it ever anyones fault when a pet goes missing uma was an indoor cat but with her wild blood she always had a craving for adventure wanderlust shed watch the birds through the window all day long shed beg and plead to come outside if ever i was hanging out in the yard shed snuck out a few times before but never for longer than two hours shes now been missing for 20 i understand uma she is a lot like me always wanting her freedom only shows love and appreciation when she wants to in a sense i feel more guilty about keeping her cooped up in a house for four years than i do about one careless step i may have taken resulting in her escape she always wanted it she always asked for it and now she got it but at the same time i was the guardian of a naive little creature i know the danger of coyotes cars and poisonous bugs and snakes i also know too well about dishonorable humans who are full of greed and lust especially if they were catch sight of such a stunningly beautiful cat as uma she did not know about these consequences i should have protected her but no matter how much a mother protects her daughter and no matter how many times we are told by our parents whats right and whats wrong we as beings with spirits are curious we know the best way to truly learn is through our experiences and our mistakes im sure my mother would agree that sometimes i might as well have been a cat speaking and hearing in a different language constantly slipping and wriggling out of her grasp as reasuarnce ive always ask my mother to trust my instincts even though they might sometimes go against hers because no one is always right now the roles are reversed and uma is in effect asking me to trust her instincts and well i guess there is nothing more i can do but have faith and wait
7226465 i didnt understand everything that was going on so i had to just take it in but i could

7226491 the vicious and abrupt collapse of the market in january and increased volatility thereafter had resulted in investors adopting a more cautious approach with higher emphasis on limiting losses
7226492 in contrast to trading the stock and index futures where risk is unlimited a purchase of a call option where the premium cost is the maximum possible loss enhances the traders ability to withstand higher volatility without undue panic
7226493 the reduced presence of retail investors is clearly reflected in the lower cost of carry of futures futures are trading at 60 70 bps higher than their underlying spot as compared to late 2007 early 2008 when cost of carry was 100 120 bps
7226494 the higher cost of carry was due to presence of retail investors who were doing leverage trading to make quick money
7226495 currently there is more than rs 9 000 crore of open interest in options expiring on or after december 8 there are institutional investors active in these long dated options

7226500 the best sounding love song ever produced an amazing techno acid line carries you through some of the greatest lyrics ever written it changed my life because after hearing the track i joined the depeche mode fan club and ended up at some of the weirdest parties in london imaginable these parties were often held at clubs so before you knew it you were missing the last train home and dancing to techno music all night at 14 i thought this was pretty cool my parents thought otherwise
7226501 they might be a bunch of complete american idiots now but when i was little well 14 green day were punk as anything and are largely responsible for my love affair with heavy music and anything vaguely associated with punk rock live music and getting obsessed with bands in general i look back on them with the same kind of fondness my parents have for the clash except green day havent always been rubbish

7226552 by segmenting the market across one campaign different incentives can be offered to consumers
7226553 with an exhaustive list of niche websites available whether by subject matter or region the power is in selecting those sites which can generate a positive roi
7226554 it wont happen quickly as the portals have shareholders to consider but certain channels will move to an impression based rate the market is maturing and more transparent online media buying is required
7226555 we may supplement some time based packages with a component of cpm but only very small the issue of transparency and data reporting is separate and tom online is working with both nielsen and local chinese data companies to formulate a standard 3 rd party system for data auditing
7226556 although online advertisements such as banner ads still boast a higher percentage the sponsored links are rising rapidly
7226557 sponsored search links enable specific audiences to be exposed to a click through and data from advertisers indicates better quality users are gained via search these paid links will gain popularity but for branding effectiveness banner ads will continue to rule
7226558 there has been a shift from static banner ads to ones which are floating animations or interactive games within the banner ad
7226559 in most cases to support the sponsored campaign users are driven to the segment by banner ads emails advertorials editorials and search some even use offline mediums to do so
7226560 sponsoring entire games or designing branded avatars that gamers can purchase are just some of the ideas currently in play
7226561 a big trend to look at in the next six months is that portals will be able to monetise games better us technology will come to china whereby advertising can be served within games and can be changed on the fly in real time this opens up a whole new advertising space in the cyberworld
7226562 the rise of social networking across greater china is a phenomenon which advertisers need to take seriously instant messaging video sites such as youtube com yoqoo com is a chinese version and other community sites are rapidly infiltrating the online space and attracting massive audiences
7226563 the main power in mainland china is in the content of the publishers sites we want to be in the text and are working closely with the publishers editorial teams and opinion leaders to get our clients mentioned in the portals on blogs and social networking sites
7226564 the chinese companies may not be as sophisticated in approach but they are far more willing to roll the sleeves up and experiment digitally
7226565 at this early stage in the mobile internets development users are interested in new content and advertising is a new feature so almost any type of ad gets high click through rates freshness wears off quickly however so advertisers need to frequently change both their ad creative and the sites where their ads appear
7226566 these mobile campaigns work exceptionally well because there is audience participation that is easily trackable and measurable
7226567 the market for mobile advertising is still in the early stages however consumers will see some interesting campaigns rolling out in the next months and then leading up to the 2008 games
7226568 brands are still testing the potential as well as the limitations of the medium
7226569 taiwan is a good market for mobile campaigns a combination of high mobile penetration and the latest in hardware make this an ideal testing ground for campaigns before they are launched into china
7226570 iptv is growing and will continue to come out of nowhere we believe the younger demographic would prefer to sit and watch tv they have selected via ip rather than having a set schedule served to them as in traditional tv
7226571 chinese designers have a profound lack of understanding of website usability fundamentals part of this stems from a lack of international education and training there are very few academics in china who have researched or written material for the chinese web design market technology is good but you dont need to use it all at once
7226572 to target the young consumers in china you have to use flash flash flash but it has to be done in a cool way
7226573 the audience for business to consumer sites in china is young hip and savvy chinese who are very trendy and they want lots of online action
7226574 for example cognac company hennessy vsop which traditionally markets to an older genteel clientele in europe and the united states has adapted its web presence for the china market its online campaign uses a lot of flash and provides a database calendar advertising the music djs that hennessy brings to china
7226575 the majority of people requiring sites for china are small to medium size businesses these clients have a website in english and they come to us to put it into chinese however chinese web users want lots of new information and constantly changing content
7226576 a notable trend is that clients are losing search engine positions to local chinese companies taking advantage of the online space to compete foreign websites need to aggressively add content as the local companies are adding content all the time
7226577 for content it needs to be written into a chinese context by a bilingual person
7226578 the connection can be lost if not written by a very good chinese copywriter and unfortunately there is a huge lack of quality chinese copywriters to complete this work
7226579 blogging softwares are sophisticated with the option to monitor and mediate to a certain level
7226580 we need our business portals to be fast in any country so we have several domain names or urls and we mirror the main site by hosting in different locations
7226581 we advise that companies keep their com urls and also purchase a cn url the two can then be tightly integrated this is more powerful for search engine recognition of both unique english and chinese keywords
7226582 the competition is rife for search engine rankings and taking a finger off the pulse could lose valuable exposure
7226583 companies need to be committed to a trial and error process and to drive their websites in the chinese way then they will be successful
7226584 most water companies are still publicly managed through local governments but there are an increasing number where they use private operators with the legislation for foreign owned companies opening up a few years ago so did the opportunity to manage water distribution to individuals
7226585 before that suez used to produce and sell water in bulk to municipalities now suez has long term distribution contracts in chongqing sanya tanggu and tanzhou
7226586 debt collection is 99 and we have a number of payment methods including direct debit customer payment at banks throughout the city and at our offices this is better than european figures
7226587 to further extend our technology output in china a multi million dollar r amp d center will open this year in shanghai the focus of the research will be on industrial effluent optimization for cost effectiveness and the reuse of industrial wastewater
7226588 the companys focus on the chinese water market includes the urban water supply and wastewater treatment sectors at present beijing capital has a daily water treatment capacity of more than 6 million tons and provides services to more than 10 million customers
7226589 the difficulty is when we have certain candidates getting several calls a week from headhunters the downside of this is it tends to push up salaries and candidates get an inflated idea of their importance in the marketplace this is one of the serious issues we are seeing managing the expectations of candidates in regards to their worth and the companys budget
7226590 high level executives in china tend to fall into two categories those who have an inflated view of their worth and those who dont
7226591 rather than job hopping they have been promoted to senior management on the basis of merit in china they are paid at international levels and have a realistic view of their worth because they understand the true benchmarks for assessment
7226592 these candidates are of most value after they have returned for two to three years and have shown they can relate their international experience to the needs of the local market
7226593 there are three distinct levels of candidates for level one finance positions the preference is asian expatriates they demand the highest salary and benefit packages then prc returnees and then you have local level born and bred in china perhaps trained with one of the big four accounting firms or within a mnc
7226594 more and more clients are trying to localise and they are filling the mid level positions with local talent pushing up local and returnees salaries
7226595 chinese companies are becoming amazing organizations and are a popular choice for candidates perhaps already working in foreign firms this places further demand on the already limited options for senior level candidates
7226596 haier lenovo baosteel huawei and other major chinese corporations offer comparative salaries the primary reason for the movement of staff from mncs to chinese firms is the opportunity to be number one
7226597 these senior staff are being offered extremely competitive executive packages in the future with the eye to ipos insurance companies to a certain extent require the window dressing and also they need to significantly upgrade their systems and processes to advance competitively in this sector
7226598 the platform available in chinese companies has improved with better opportunities for chinese lawyers for international law firms or mncs the concern is what type of career path they can realistically give chinese lawyers international law firms particularly are restricted by the licensing regulations as to the career level they can provide resulting in a flow of chinese staff to local companies
7226599 headhunting is not the same in china as anywhere else in the world it is completely different
7226600 you have companies with global expectations and they report heavily on their top and bottom line there isnt the opportunity for headhunters to make quick placements within a company every single facet of the spend has to be attributed to the bottom line
7226601 often companies localise at senior executive levels based entirely on cost because a prc national can be 60 per cent cheaper than an expatriate in the same role
7226602 unfortunately they generally provide just 50 per cent of the solution localisation on these terms makes no sense if the localised executive is incapable of building on the foundation already in place
7226603 in our industry there is so much movement in the middle levels talent are not in roles long enough to grow into senior positions we are only now seeing mncs bringing in trainers to develop programs specifically for the china market and the area most in demand is in leadership training
7226604 this compounds the lack of supply we have because culturally in china this industry has not gained enough momentum it is still not seen as a concrete profession and there are few university programs relating to advertising and pr
7226605 law schools in china are ramping up their programs to feed this supply however these graduates are not that useful until they have gained practical knowledge there is an oversupply of these graduates but not enough experienced lawyers at the top end
7226606 companies should not import products and attempt to maintain their western labels the label should take into consideration cultural considerations like colour the benefits of health and the product names should connect with chinese consumers
7226607 to make these rules including the labelling regulations more efficient we are constantly refining them a new rule from 1 april is that labels that were previously pre approved through beijing will no longer be required
7226608 the label and product will be inspected at the point of entry of the imported products the primary requirement is for the chinese label to be submitted alongside the overseas label with the additional required paperwork if the inspection team finds any discrepancy between the label and the products they test in the lab the product will be rejected
7226609 the new system is quicker and within three days we can have our goods released before in beijing the process could take weeks because of the sheer volume of trade as companies all over the world increase their efforts to export their food and beverage to china the demand on the aqsiq has risen enormously
7226610 the primary reason is related to the health benefits of the premium quality product with the chicken and pork scares in china the market for premium quality beef and seafood is substantial
7226611 it is still a challenge for importers to supply fresh chilled goods to us and we have no really sizeable storage facilities at the restaurant therefore the logistics costs of the importers to provide this fresh product pushes the costs up further
7226612 a great example is the olive oil market this is unquestionably one of the fastest growing premium import growth markets yet not one supplier actually stands out from the rest
7226613 no brand has established itself as the number one brand and part of the reason is the consumer does not yet know how to differentiate between a good olive oil and an average olive oil
7226614 the chinese consumer will often make a choice based on price the higher the price the better the product therefore educating on product value is essential
7226615 in the beginning in china we had endless problems with intellectual property infractions companies would copy our label and then sell an inferior product within
7226616 we fought it for a long time in the courts but then realised that as pioneers we just need to focus on our real customers and both educate them and continue to develop quality products for them
7226617 this is a golden age for csr in china as attitudes are still being formed
7226618 china needs long term sustainable programmes that not only benefit the company but ultimately the end user these are the kinds of projects that are now possible in china because in many ways csr mindsets have not been solidified
7226619 foreign firms are answerable to their headquarters and they need to show employment confidentiality and compliance contracts and operational handbooks that state how business operations should be conducted staff sign off on these and consequently this decreases the companys liability whether these policies are enforced is another consideration but by and large the mncs do implement these guidelines
7226620 o ver half of respondents believe that companies should engage in csr activities and would feel more loyal towards that company for doing so
7226621 historically chinese stakeholders have worried about mncs taking short term views in china and also potentially viewing the country as a place to market and sell products and services that could be of lesser quality
7226622 now with chinas accession into the wto its not surprising to see chinese stakeholders demanding even greater levels of quality and transparency from foreign business
7226623 80 per cent of respondents in a study of chinese opinion leaders feel that mncs operating in china are held to a higher standard of performance versus chinese firms 56 per cent say that those standards have increased during the past year and 95 per cent believe this increase is reasonable
7226624 there is a real need for companies to engage stakeholders in their businesses in more relevant ways that underscore the mutual benefits for both
7226625 an example of poor csr is when mncs donate large amounts of money to a random charity with no requirement of transparency no idea of where the million dollars are going to go the company gets its photo in the paper and then thinks it was money well spent
7226626 we are using public relations to further our goal however it is an integrated project whereby we engage the chinese public
7226627 we work closely with government departments and aim to meet our shareholder expectations
7226628 i heard about the chinese way of doing business but nothing prepared me for the challenges or the extent of the issues i would be confronted with
7226629 when i order things i am asked to pay a special price then there are special payments to ensure orders there are special customs prices that no one can explain the staff commissions are out of sorts and it is a complete ethical nightmare
7226630 i established early on that this isnt the way we do business back home and i am certain that the chinese government will start making examples out of foreign firms engaging in questionable business dealings
7226631 my staff know i have zero tolerance and they think im insane because they believed we wouldnt receive a repeat order and that the buyer is used to the old business arrangement
7226632 but my concerns are long term and im confident the business and its stakeholders will have a positive outcome
7226633 in china our core focus is on immigration assistance property services and helping employees to get settled with cross cultural education
7226634 on the surface it may appear relatively straightforward but a complex combination of information gathering counselling patience and knowledge is required this is far more than the traditional requirement of shipping personal and household effects and we are now engaged by companies for a longer period of time to deliver this assistance
7226635 projects related to china have greatly increased our consulting team has conducted research related relocations in china for three consecutive years in order to provide cutting edge and relevant data to our clients
7226636 the enormous growth in alternative assignment types and the realisation that a global relocation policy doesnt always have a good fit for china has resulted in us creating china specific addendums
7226637 the economic expansion in china has clearly led to pressures on recruiting retaining and developing talent
7226638 this may look like an anticipated decrease on the surface compared to the past three years
7226639 but when we see that more than three quarters of current assignments are long term traditional expatriate assignments even the status quo still represents a large anticipated number
7226640 this type of growth shows a shift in companies focus from a more traditional candidate pool of expatriates that came from the same regions as the company headquarters
7226641 it reflects a number of variables including an assumption that it could be less expensive to send employees from within the region and that ethnic chinese from other parts of asia may be more successful in the chinese business environment and in providing effective leadership in china
7226642 in the commercial sector mncs are still focusing on first tier cities initially shanghai and beijing followed by guangzhou
7226643 the growth in second tier cities is predominantly in the manufacturing and logistics industries manufacturing because it is cheaper and logistics to support the manufacturers
7226644 normally mncs anticipate the trend in a region and then ahead of time set up representative offices this is what we are currently seeing in the second tier cities for example as banks extend into second tier cities insurers follow by establishing their representative offices
7226645 firstly we are seeing shanghai companies relocate employees to neighbouring cities such as suzhou hangzhou and ningbo also in relation to the incentives provided by the china national plan we have seen increased activity in chengdu
7226646 for us relocation within the asia region is more frequent than that between china and europe and china and america says asian tigers lau
7226647 and at present intra china relocation is mostly from other provinces into shanghai
7226648 there is some increase but it is not nearly as dramatic as in shanghai which sees a steady 30 per cent increase per year the figures are nowhere near this in any second tier city
7226649 companies need to provide more amenities to support the lack of infrastructure housing schools and lifestyle
7226650 we are being asked to assist on some of these corporate campuses at a time when hardship allowances for first tier cities in china are being reduced they are increasing for second and third tier locations
7226651 as cities like shanghai develop at an incredible rate the away from home allowance is being drastically cut by companies
7226652 the biggest change however has been in the rental side
7226653 the law is significant because it is the first nationwide law and it will contribute to a comprehensive development strategy
7226654 there are many positives including an obligation for grid companies to enter into agreements with renewable energy enterprises it provides for investment by all economic entities and it forces accountability of personnel in charge and of legal entities which do not fulfil their obligations out of the law
7226655 the national laws and regulations are one element but then the local municipalities can have their own regulation and these are often more stringent than the national ones
7226656 we phase out some companies and we also release publicly the names of energy hungry or energy efficient companies
7226657 each province is now accountable under the new laws and is taxed according to their energy efficiency performance
7226658 the two year project has been endorsed by the government and will hopefully lead to future business with auto manufacturers in china
7226659 this is why we are accelerating the technology through partnerships with chinese academic institutions it is an opportunity for us to quickly develop a commercially viable option because most of the government bodies and enterprises seeking to invest in environmental protection work under financial constraints it is critical that the technologies they invest in are practical
7226660 at the moment we have three cell buses in beijing and we have signed an mou to supply fuel cells to 100 demonstration vehicles in shanghai in 2007
7226661 the songhua river contamination disaster in november 2005 was a significant turning point for the government there is now a real emphasis to develop industrial waste water recycling technologies and to clean up the river basins in china
7226662 our focus is on the chinese water market including the urban water supply and waste water treatment sectors
7226663 at present beijing capital has a daily water treatment capacity of more than 6 million tonnes and provides services to more than 10 million customers
7226664 china is our number one focus and we are making significant investment in china from an employee standpoint and from a technology transfer standpoint via joint ventures and partnerships
7226665 we are involved in several pilot projects in china and feel confident in our ability to deliver technology solutions in the water industry
7226666 waste water is a difficult area for companies in china the tariffs for waste water are so low in most areas that it is impossible to get economic return
7226667 as more and more chinese companies are getting involved so the cost basis is greatly reducing on industrial projects the good thing is the government is forcing companies to conduct clean ups therefore the demand for the technology is increasing
7226668 wind energy is one of the fastest developing areas in china
7226669 chinas wind power resources are abundant approximately 250 gigawatts of exploitable wind resources exist at a height of 10 metres above ground with world class winds along coastal regions of guangdong and fujian and superb sources in parts of inner mongolia xinjiang shandong liaoning and zhejiang
7226670 as a huge consumer of energy but without resources of our own we rely heavily on other provinces and from overseas for energy
7226671 so for shanghai it is important to speed up the natural gas station construction and also to develop alternative energies one issue is that the shanghai government does not have much experience with wind power generation our project at yangshan port is a pioneer project and we have been working with overseas companies to develop the technology
7226672 t he third generation solar cells that are being developed will be ready for industrial scale production at the end of the year
7226673 the new cells are developed from space technology and are the smallest solar cells available
7226674 the government is very interested in this technology specifically for use in industrial parks we have been offered significant economic incentives and subsidies to share the technology in solar parks in guanxi province
7226675 the project goal is to develop buildings that achieve 75 per cent energy efficiency 25 per cent higher than the shanghai government standard
7226676 the shanghai government has issued 20 pieces of land to be used for constructions that totally integrate renewable and energy efficient technologies there has been a lot of interest from the organisers of the 2010 expo looking at ways to integrate the technologies and concepts
7226677 to achieve the energy efficiency rating many technologies are utilised in projects including solar power efficient separators for insulation shade systems concrete protection systems water drainage and recycling systems
7226678 the interesting fact is that traditionally eco friendly buildings cost marginally more roughly 3 8 per cent higher yet some developers in the project believe they are meeting the 75 per cent standard at the same cost this will be an important factor when marketing to developers
7226679 at the time everyone thought the business was too early for the market in saying that i had several offers of over a million dollars to purchase the domain name ebooks com
7226680 as early adopters of the model we now have a market lead but other publishers are slow to gather momentum
7226681 the challenge for publishers is that the digital age forces us to rewrite our business plans epublishing means there are no printing and distribution costs yet consumers have different expectations of how to download books and on the pricing points
7226682 the business model can still be profitable but the view has changed
7226683 in china the market is very different it is a seductive market for almost everything but for electronic publishing it is especially attractive because the chinese are early adopters of technology
7226684 they have easy access to hardware and can easily swap between mp3 and ipods and other handheld devices the format of the digitised content is not as much of an issue as it is in other countries
7226685 at a recent conference a chinese academic was boasting of 300 000 ebook titles in their collection this is phenomenal for us we are proud to have almost 100 000 titles and we have been operating for years
7226686 in china there are about 500 000 k12 schools of these about 60 000 have campus lan and we supply digital libraries to 2 500 schools in 26 provinces we have only touched the edge of the opportunity
7226687 this market was tortured by phenomenon including piracy but the market is ready now and will continue to grow especially with the support of the government
7226688 in talking with the 200 publishers that we have partnered with there is a growing interest in digital publishing one issue is that most of the publishers are state owned companies in which there exists hardly any incentive scheme for r amp d the industry is highly segmented and so it is very difficult to launch their own digital works
7226689 the physical distribution of traditional media is not yet established in china so it easier for the population to obtain digital content the chinese are much more open than western consumers with regards to methods of buying media and the physical delivery of electronic content is easy
7226690 the chinese characters are easier to read on small screens than english downloading magazine articles and other material proves a simple and cost effective way of receiving information and entertainment for our clients we customise and then distribute econtent via web services or wap
7226691 to be proactive we have made sure we secure copyright correctly additionally we work with publishers to educate them on how to obtain proper copyright
7226692 for legitimate chinese companies they are often answerable to shareholders so they are securing proper rights for the use of material only a few years ago publishers were fighting big portals but now these same businesses are working to protect their own ipr in many areas and in turn are honouring copyright

7226714 el comandante tiene la facultad de darle salida a ese vuelo y eso es lo que ocurri lo que pas despu s desafortunadamente no podemos especular ni entrar a hablar de ello porque es una competencia exclusiva de la comisi n de investigaci n
7226715 es normal que en cualquier compa a con el volumen de operaci n de spanair con 300 vuelos al d a y 10 millones de pasajeros al a o tengamos incidencias t cnicas pero para eso tenemos un complejo de infraestructuras y personal que est n plenamente avalados por las autoridades a trav s de inspecciones continuas para dar soluci n a cualquier problema
7226716 just because we can brew a vaccine for nearly every known pathogen does that mean that we should
7226717 was there ever a time that vaccinations in practice made sense
7226718 do vaccinations in practice make sense in any setting today
7226719 epidemiologic studies have shown that as families improve their living conditions hygiene nutrition literacy and education the risk of life threatening acute infectious inflammatory diseases very much decreases families with good living conditions hygiene nutrition and education probably would benefit from vaccinations very little or not at all

7226723 from a planning point of view we want to prepare as well as we can for the champions trophy the bangladesh series is a great lead up to that the guys have had a bit of time off and are a little bit rusty so its going to be important that we use this series well
7226724 theyve really improved a lot and they have an australian coach in jamie siddons so they will know us well

7226766 nigeria produces almost 45 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in africa from its gas flaring by oil firms in the niger delta while south africa produces as much from industrial pollution
7226767 nigeria emits 20 billion cubic metres of gas flares annually accounting for 13 percent of the global 150 billion cubic metres of gas flares every year and making it second in the world after russia
7226768 the emissions from nigeria and south africa huge as they seem can by no means compare to the emissions from the industrialised countries the countries should do something about them at least for the sake of their immediate communities
7226769 this explains why south africa insists that developed countries should take the lead in emissions reduction before developing nations cut down their own emissions
7226770 it doesnt make sense for nigeria and south africa for instance to reduce their emissions while the industrialised nations who are largely responsible for climate change do not make any efforts at reducing theirs
7226771 the atmosphere is a common space for all and our emissions are infinitesimal compared to those in developed countries
7226772 emissions reductions should not be used as a ploy to create obstacles on our way to development the developed countries should help us with low carbon technology
7226773 it was obvious that the rhino was injured to some degree as it left its forest to come out on the flat terrain of the oil palm plantation

7226788 i crossed over the fifth tee and steve and hunter mahan were standing there and i looked at their board and steve was 12 under and i was only six under
7226789 so i really felt i was out there playing for position
7226790 luckily i got some birdies going after i dropped a shot on 12 and next thing i knew i was tied for the lead standing on the 17th tee
7226791 so im very very surprised to be sitting here right next to the lead right now
7226792 i made two stupid plays in a row at 11 and 12

7226811 luvdarts are much more than just a mobile video download to the consumer they are digital greeting cards they can send to their family friends and lovers but to a business they are valuable tools in harnessing the power of word of mouth peer2peer advertising
7226812 well its a well known fact that the most effective marketing comes from personal recommendations by family and friends and there have never been greater opportunities for a business to market directly to consumers than the mobile space presents today the problem is how to get directly to the consumer without violating their privacy and rules set forth to protect the consumer by the wireless industry luvdarts get people to spread the word family to family friend to friend lover to lover and we let the businesses subsidize the activity
7226813 its simple we let a business run a campaign whenever they want to drive more traffic to their physical location or website s they can choose the start and end dates their target market daily download budget and incentives we then stock their luvdart downloading store with co branded luvdarts they distribute a code to their customers who can visit that store and download luvdarts free under the terms of that campaign
7226814 oh i get it the business pays for the download later at a wholesale price
7226815 thats right the business only pays for whats been downloaded to be clear there is a setup charge for each campaign
7226816 hmmm very interesting concept i see where people will want to send luvdarts to their family and friends as they also carry a businesses message and promotions without violating their privacy how are you going to get this going with businesses
7226817 thats a great question first we think any business that advertises in the yellow pages will be interested in a luvdarts campaign why the average business is paying a monthly amount for an ad they cant change for 12 months in the yellow pages we give them the ability to run a campaign of different sizes and targets whenever they please for local businesses as well as national that is huge the traffic that will come from a campaign is generated mainly from their existing patrons word of mouth and the business is able to control the times when it may need more traffic driven to its location
7226818 well it seems like youve got a winner here i will be watching your progress
7226819 thanks we luv what we do and weve put a lot into it by the way we will be at the ctia entertainment conference seeking alliances as we are now set to do business with the world will you be there

7226925 when you play as a striker it is always like this

7226942 if chairman murad is not willing or capable of bringing in his three milf commanders to answer for their terroristic acts then he and his men must stand down as government forces enforce the law short of that there will be no let up in government offensive
7226943 the military and the police cannot suspend their law enforcement operations unless the three base commanders of the milf are neutralized and punished in accordance with our laws for their acts of terrorism against innocent and helpless civilians
7226944 they may continue their violent acts even if agreements are signed with the milf leadership
7226945 the inaction of the milf leadership will be construed as its tacit approval of the criminal acts of its three commander and will be a clear proof of milf leaderships insincerity to pursue the conclusion of the peace talks
7226946 we have gone a long way for peace but not at the expense of our innocent civilians who seek vindication for the violence inflicted on them by those lawless milf groups our peace loving citizens expect no less there is no all out war in mindanao this is waging all out peace in mindanao

7226950 some poems despite the flowery language are timeless they stay relevant forever
7226951 t4yp aims to do one classical production every year but i didnt want to do a full length shakespeare play because language is still a barrier so i decided to work with something a little more subjective poetry
7226952 of course we still had to tackle language but this way the ensemble were able to each take home a sonnet and work on decoding it and offer their own interpretations you should see what they have come up with youll be amazed
7226953 some of them are set to music some are portrayed via multimedia and some have been turned into dialogue if you pay close attention youll realise that one of them isnt even shakespeare
7226954 love amp beauty is a contemplation of just that love and beauty using the immortal words of a man that nearly everybody considers the authority on the subject we cant go wrong with that

7226964 that way i always hear the latest news which i can tell my friends
7226965 once there was a triangle that was as most triangles are always busy
7226966 holding up roofs supporting bridges making music catching the wind for sailboats being slices of pie and more
7226967 the triangles favorite thing however was to slip into place when people put their hands on their hips
7226968 that way i always hear the latest news which i can tell my friends
7226969 its sides were so smooth it had trouble keeping its balance
7226970 its friends couldnt tell which side it was on and began to avoid the shape

7226977 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7226978 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7226979 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7226980 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7226981 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7226982 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7226983 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7226984 you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of privatizing social security
7226985 you cant change america and end this war in iraq when you declare and again these are johns words no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have end of quote
7226986 a long process but it always pointed in bidens direction
7226987 many others were discussed but my impression was that those three a few weeks ago were really the centerpiece kaine bayh and biden
7226988 four years will be disastrous for the economy the political system the judiciary
7226989 i think its as good as any movie ive made
7226990 unless it was a film out of europe or something
7226991 these people onscreen lovers carradine and duvall werent big stars
7226992 a long process but it always pointed in bidens direction
7226993 many others were discussed but my impression was that those three a few weeks ago were really the centerpiece kaine bayh and biden
7226994 we made the final three in a competition where they dont give out silver and bronze medals
7226995 bidens not my fantasy vp choice or close to it but nonetheless pretty good better than many of the other floated names
7226996 bidens not a horrific pick hes fine considering the choices
7226997 biden wasnt my favorite choice for the gig but he was far from my least favorite choice either
7226998 any pick designed to cover up a flaw in obama i e lack of foreign policy credentials only accentuates those flaws
7226999 if obamas core message is change and judgment based on his prescience on the iraq war vote well then biden is the exact opposite of those things
7227000 extremely well suited to be an aggressive attack dog running mate
7227001 given obamas reluctance to play the partisan card it should be fun having a real pit bull in the number two position to do some of the necessary dirty work
7227002 while mccain is someone who is wealthy enough not to know how many houses he and his wife own biden is not a wealthy man even the city he was born in scranton pennsylvania kind of embodies this connection to working americans

7227009 when i became a guide i bait fished i had an instant clientele it was families moms and dads and kids it was so much fun i just had a blast but i thought there must be something else
7227010 its exactly the psychology of an arms race from the outside it seems totally crazy but from the inside it seems necessary and compelling
7227011 the base minimum is a thing of the past there is a lot of one upsmanship going on whatever the students want is prety much what theyre getting
7227012 by catering to the students theyre trying to court away from other schools theyre making their product more expensive
7227013 hell have a fist in the face of john mccain every day and i think he has this level of gravitas as well
7227014 were lucky to have both it showcases obamas judgment that he chose somebody like this a good pick not just for august or october but a good pick in the event that something happens when hes president of the united states
7227015 if he doesnt it wont be because he didnt have the opportunity
7227016 were fantastic so much better than we say we are
7227017 we tap into that need for whimsy in peoples lives
7227018 het leven is een kans profiteer ervan het leven is mooi bewonder het het leven is een zegen beproef het het leven is een droom verwezenlijk die het leven is een uitdaging neem die aan het leven is een plicht vervul die het leven is een spel speel het het leven is duur koester het het leven is rijkdom bewaar die het leven is liefde geniet ervan het leven is een belofte kom die na het leven is droefheid overwin die het leven is een lied zing het het leven is een strijd aanvaard die het leven is een tragedie zie die onder ogen het leven is geluk maak het het leven is te kostbaar verwoest het niet het leven is leven vecht ervoor
7227019 our approach has been exceedingly effective for both young men and women we are uniquely positioned to give clients the wake up call of wilderness therapy as well as the counseling services and tools to stay clean and sober permanently
7227020 we are the only wilderness program out there that teaches daily living skills and helps clients acclimate to being in a community setting prior to discharge so the transition onward doesnt come as such a culture shock that gives each individual a chance to see how recovery will look for them not just in the wilderness but back in real life
7227021 by living and working with these young people day and night both in the unfamiliar wilderness setting and familiar base camp environment we can go beyond words and talk therapy and actually see how their substance abuse and co occurring issues impact their daily lives
7227022 in just two years we have established a strong national reputation for clinical excellence
7227023 our therapists travel all over the country to attend conferences develop new skills and improve the quality of their services their hard work has helped us make a name for ourselves in a relatively short period of time
7227024 the substance abuse field is relatively young so there is always room for improvement
7227025 one of our hallmarks is that were never satisfied with the status quo we are always evolving and finding new ways to provide the highest quality clinical services and state of the art treatment when it comes to substance abuse and co occurring mental health issues
7227026 is dit iets waarmee we effici nter kunnen samenwerken of meer interactie met de samenleving kunnen krijgen zo ja hoe gaan we dat dan inzetten

7227041 no siento presi n a adida por afrontar el us open como n mero uno
7227042 estamos preocupados seriamente con este tema y estamos haciendo llamamientos constantes al gobierno socialista para que tome medidas porque no puede abandonar a la gente a su suerte
7227043 se trata de un gobierno que no quiso tomar en cuenta las propuestas de iu para limitar la capacidad de endeudamiento de la familias como ocurre en otros pa ses europeos y que ten a efectos beneficiosos sobre los precios de mercado porque los ajustar a
7227044 pues ahora prosigui que zapatero asuma estas consecuencias de su pol ticas y ayude a esas familias a las que ha permitido hipotecarse por encima de sus posibilidades con medidas reales para paliar la situaci n
7227045 estamos viendo ya las consecuencias estamos conociendo situaciones concretas y no hay m s que ver los datos de los propios juzgados para ver que estamos ante un incremento aunque un incremento menor que en espa a de las ejecuciones de hipotecas por impago
7227046 as como en espa a han apostado b sicamente por la vivienda libre en euskadi el peso de la vivienda protegida es muy fuerte
7227047 en poca de crisis hay muchos constructores que se han refugiado en la vivienda protegida para mantener su actividad y su empleo y es bueno porque eso aten a las consecuencias de la crisis

7227056 well keep it in our files and should our priorities change well be in touch
7227057 practice in the realm of ideas is what financial investors do in the stock market they defy the crowd to buy low and sell high buying low means pursuing ideas that are unknown or at least slightly out of favor but having growth potential just as not every stock with a low price earnings ratio is a good financial investment neither is every new idea a good creativity investment buying low is inherently risky selling high means finding buyers for ones work convincing them of its worth and moving on to new projects when that work becomes valued and yields a significant return analogous to stock market investment success sometimes creativity fails to occur because a person puts forth sells an idea prematurely or holds an idea so long that it becomes common or obsolete
7227058 ill sell when it gets back to where im even
7227059 this is a great idea thats just ahead of its momentum curve

7227070 where does this product fit into the grand scheme of things
7227071 its embedded into our system well pay but not stop
7227072 once youre found guilty of infringement if company x wants to force you to stop thats their call and we have no leeway in the matter
7227073 well an injunction isnt automatic it has to be weighed among certain factors
7227074 how dramatically different is product concept x from whats out there today
7227075 can we add jims name to the patent as an inventor
7227076 theyre pretty good given what youre trying to do product seems like its effective
7227077 and if we were company abc who saw this product successfully launch and wanted to develop a competing product where would we start getting around this patent
7227078 as your patent counsel id recommend you just add a bunch of other non active ingredients to the product mix that gets you around this consisting essentially language

7227240 who do you think will respond to this idea of an un church
7227241 i can see how this billing as an un church might attract an eclectic crowd but is that the type of audience that is going to support your efforts
7227242 i see by your sign on the front of the building with the proofreading notation inserting the
7227243 so youre not presenting yourself as the ultimate authority in your church
7227244 just tell me what to believe so that i can get on with my life
7227245 so youre saying that when you quote scripture you encourage the audience to decide for themselves whether the scripture is true or not
7227246 this scripture is not universally applicable in its literal sense
7227247 dont believe only the literal meaning of what you read delve into the deeper teachings of scripture test these teachings in your own experience and if you find them valid apply them with gusto
7227248 wait a minute you mentioned the scriptures of buddhism hinduism etc do you use those scriptures as well
7227249 ok youve said you call yourself a scriptural skeptic but you just referred to the likely teachings of jesus what did you mean by that
7227250 for god so loved the world that he gave his only son so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life
7227251 so it sounds to me like youre promoting spiritual anarchy when you depreciate the authority of scripture for your congregation

7227298 de koran is een fascistisch boek dat oproept tot geweld
7227299 ik roep het al jaren een gematigde islam bestaat niet een gematigde islam bestaat niet het bestaat niet omdat er geen onderscheid is tussen goede islam en slechte islam er is islam en daar houdt het mee op en islam is de koran en niets dan de koran en de koran is het mein kampf van een religie die beoogt anderen te elimineren die die anderen niet moslims ongelovige honden noemt inferieure wezens
7227300 ik wil niet aanzetten tot haat ik wil dat de koran wordt verboden dat is een politieke mening ik zit in de tweede kamer om die te uiten
7227301 ik kan uw mening nog zo abject vinden maar ik zal uw recht verdedigen om die te uiten
7227302 het geeft ook geen pas dat een parlementari r zich op deze manier uitlaat
7227303 om te wijzen op de angstaanjagende kanten van de koran als gruwelijke uitspraken uit de heilige schrift van de moslims worden geciteerd worden meestal direct twee vergoelijkende opmerkingen gemaakt de citaten zijn uit hun verband gerukt en de bijbel bevat ook minder fijne passages
7227304 de choquerende uitlatingen over vrouwen homos en joden sluiten naadloos aan bij de onverdraagzame toon in heel de koran die oproept tot een genadeloze strijd tegen ongelovigen dat is heel wat anders dan de boodschap van naastenliefde die domineert in het nieuwe testament
7227305 in het westen is het bovendien mogelijk de eigen heilige schrift ter discussie te stellen een mogelijkheid die in islamitische kringen ontbreekt een multicultureel probleem is ook dat de meeste moslims geen geestelijke distantie tot de koran kunnen opbrengen veel christenen zien de bijbel als een waardevolle inspiratiebron zonder alles letterlijk te nemen
7227306 ik ben er zelf een maar vertrouw nooit een moslim
7227307 de sleutel hierbij zijn liberale waarden debat felle geloofskritiek en volstrekte vrijheid van meningsuiting
7227308 ik vind de islam een achterlijke religie de koran een achterhaald en verdorven geweldpredikend schrift en de manier waarop moslims hun geloof praktiseren een teken van achtergesteldheid

7227320 aanvragers van de pardonregeling die niet bekend zijn bij de ind hebben een verklaring van de burgemeester van hun woon of verblijfplaats nodig dat ze het hele jaar 2006 in nederland waren in de volkskrant van vrijdag 29 juni zei bakker burgemeester van hilversum dat hij geen gegevens van aanvragers aan de staatssecretaris zou doorgeven als die geen positieve burgemeestersverklaring zouden krijgen
7227321 wallage burgemeester van groningen zal asielzoekers die kansloos zijn voor het pardon ontmoedigen een aanvraag in te dienen als ze dat niet doen dan zal hij ook geen gegevens doorgeven
7227322 ja maar soms moet je optreden tegen de heersende orde

7227329 het voorstel voor een nieuw eu verdrag is 96 procent hetzelfde als de ontwerptekst van de verworpen europese grondwet dat blijkt uit een eerste analyse van de wijzigingsvoorstellen die maandag is gepresenteerd aldus de britse denktank open europe dinsdag
7227330 we hebben een helder advies gehad een duidelijk nee het is nu aan de tweede kamer om het gevraagde advies van de bevolking op te volgen en te interpreteren of botweg naast zich neer te leggen dat laatste is dus geen optie voor de vvd wie dezelfde of ongeveer dezelfde tekst wil invoeren heeft geen respect voor de uitspraak van de bevolking en zou dus moeten uitleggen waarom er dan geen nieuw referendum plaatsvindt wie echter zoals de vvd de uitspraak wil volgen interpreteert die uitspraak en vervult daarmee de rol die de volksvertegenwoordiging moet spelen

7227332 ze zijn met nederland europees kampioen geworden en dan moet je niet met een surinaamse vlag gaan lopen als je uiting aan die gevoelens wil geven moet je dat op een ander moment elders doen

7227339 als je ervan uit gaat dat een substanti le bevolkingsgroep andere tradities een andere religie brengt dan zie ik dat als een wederzijds proces enerzijds zal de islam door de europese cultuur en tradities be nvloed worden en niet hetzelfde blijven anderzijds is het belangrijk dat zon grote groep zich wortelt in onze samenleving er een onlosmakelijk onderdeel van wordt
7227340 ja dat kan ik me voorstellen dat nederland is een land van joods christelijke islamitische tradities maar daar gaan wel een paar eeuwen overheen
7227341 voor het behoud en het versterken van onze nederlandse en westerse cultuur die gebaseerd is op de joods christelijke traditie die vele malen beter en beschaafder is dan de achterlijke islamitische cultuur en traditie en daar haaks op staat
7227342 we spreken echter over een joods christelijke traditie vanwege de historisch overgeleverde invloed van het joodse en christelijke geloof op de kernwaarden in ons land niet omdat enkele eeuwen geleden een bescheiden joodse gemeenschap naar nederland kwam
7227343 welk geloof je aanhangt maakt niet uit iedereen die naar nederland komt heeft onze kernwaarden te onderschrijven dat principe gaat bij deze coalitie van cda pvda en christenunie op de helling
7227344 popper wijst ons de weg de kritische methode kritiek niet alleen toelaten maar ook bevorderen we moeten de vrije keuze vrijwaren het individu boven de groep plaatsen niet wachten op de staat maar bovenal onszelf engageren
7227345 de overheid is een handelaar in gestolen goederen en elke verkiezing is een soort van geavanceerde veiling van die goederen
7227346 de vvd is zeer tevreden dat het voorstel dat ze zelf heeft gedaan om de rol van de nationale parlementen te verstevigen oranje kaart door de regering succesvol is overgenomen hiermee kunnen we een begin maken met een veel betere controle op brussel en krijgt nederland meer zeggenschap

7227363 in keeping with his abiding belief in due process president yaradua has directed that the army council as well as the navy and air force boards should meet early next week this week to ratify the promotions of the chief of defence staff and service chiefs to their new ranks he will decorate them with the insignias of their new ranks thereafter
7227364 in view of comments and speculations in the media concerning the recent changes in the command structure of the armed forces the presi dency wishes to affirm that the changes were made in the normal course of affairs and were not a reaction to any particular occurrence
7227365 the changes announced on wednesday were certainly not made in response to any perceived threat to government and the stability of the nation attempts to tie the changes to statements by some politicians should therefore be disregarded as mere mischief
7227366 the fact is that a change of guards in the armed forces had been on the cards for sometime since both the former chief of defence staff general andrew azazi and the former chief of naval staff admiral ganiyu adekeye became due for retirement several months ago
7227367 the changes were not made earlier because of the presidents insistence that things be done properly at all times he demanded proper background checks and briefs on all those recommended as replacements for the outgoing service chiefs and also undertook necessary consultations
7227368 reports that the president refused to see the former service chiefs before the announcement of the changes are also untrue
7227369 the former service chiefs are respected professionals who did their jobs to the best of their abilities and president yaradua met with them on wednesday afternoon to thank them for their services to the nation that was at least about two hours before their meeting with the minister of defence alhaji yayale ahmed

7227397 the ignorance and misinterpretation of computing threats are actually increasing the damage of the pending threats

7227402 the street doesnt need all that crap in the middle of it like that median strip just get a bulldozer through there and get rid of all the stuff that isnt needed
7227403 orange has been neglected in funding because the government does go on the census
7227404 we need to develop a profile of the community if we are going to compete with the dubbos and the waggas for funding
7227405 they do look at hard numbers when theyre looking at prioritising when they have areas with a lot more aboriginal people
7227406 we have tried to fix it by putting people in those communities to help fill out the forms during the last census but we still missed a lot
7227407 having read a lot of books and stories about people who have used doulas i was very keen to try it myself
7227408 i have always been against having too much intervention so ill work with the doula to see if i can avoid using pain relief
7227409 also the idea of being able to have someone by my side the whole time during the birth really appealed to me
7227410 i walk women through their fears the myths of childbirth and i encourage a range of methods for having an active birth
7227411 i encourage the father to be more involved at times many of them feel uncomfortable and dont know what to do
7227412 it doesnt have to be the situation where the woman is yelling you bastard you did this to me
7227413 i feel that if there is such a thing as a serene way to give birth then this will be serene

7227430 ive complained before about the undeserving admiration given to many science fiction novels and short stories of earlier decades such reverence frequently results in fans recommending these works to people wanting to try the genre and thats not a good thing readers new to the genre are not served well by recommendations to read isaac asimov ee doc smith robert heinlein or the like such fiction is no longer relevant is often written with sensibilities offensive to modern readers usually has painfully bad prose and is mostly hard to find because its out of print a better recommendation would be a current author such as richard morgan alastair reynolds iain m banks ken macleod stephen baxter and so on i can hear howls of outrage across the tinterweb

7227434 luvdarts are much more than just a mobile video download to the consumer they are digital greeting cards they can send to their family friends and lovers but to a business they are valuable tools in harnessing the power of word of mouth peer2peer advertising
7227435 well its a well known fact that the most effective marketing comes from personal recommendations by family and friends and there have never been greater opportunities for a business to market directly to consumers than the mobile space presents today the problem is how to get directly to the consumer without violating their privacy and rules set forth to protect the consumer by the wireless industry luvdarts get people to spread the word family to family friend to friend lover to lover and we let the businesses subsidize the activity
7227436 its simple we let a business run a campaign whenever they want to drive more traffic to their physical location or website s they can choose the start and end dates their target market daily download budget and incentives we then stock their luvdart downloading store with co branded luvdarts they distribute a code to their customers who can visit that store and download luvdarts free under the terms of that campaign
7227437 oh i get it the business pays for the download later at a wholesale price
7227438 thats right the business only pays for whats been downloaded to be clear there is a setup charge for each campaign
7227439 hmmm very interesting concept i see where people will want to send luvdarts to their family and friends as they also carry a businesses message and promotions without violating their privacy how are you going to get this going with businesses
7227440 thats a great question first we think any business that advertises in the yellow pages will be interested in a luvdarts campaign why the average business is paying a monthly amount for an ad they cant change for 12 months in the yellow pages we give them the ability to run a campaign of different sizes and targets whenever they please for local businesses as well as national that is huge the traffic that will come from a campaign is generated mainly from their existing patrons word of mouth and the business is able to control the times when it may need more traffic driven to its location
7227441 well it seems like youve got a winner here i will be watching your progress

7227447 support the prudent and calibrated use of all instruments of united states national power in iraq including diplomatic economic intelligence and military instruments in support of the policy with respect to the government of the islamic republic of iran and its proxies
7227448 the united states should designate the islamic revolutionary guards corps as a foreign terrorist organization and place the islamic revolutionary guards corps on the list of specially designated global terrorists
7227449 iran through the use of the iranian republican guard corps quds force seeks to turn the shiia militia extremists into a hezbollah like force to serve its interests and fight a proxy war against the iraqi state and coalition forces in iraq
7227450 the political power of the occupiers the united states and allied foreign forces in iraq is collapsing rapidly soon we will see a huge power vacuum in the region of course we are prepared to fill the gap
7227451 biden said the best deterrent to prevent pre emptive military action in iran is to make it clear even if it is at the end of his final term action will be taken against bush to ensure his legacy will be marred for all time

7227515 when you stop playing it is difficult to come back and play again you need rhythm even more when you are a striker because you need confidence if you dont have confidence you are nothing
7227516 i dont think i am back to my best yet i am still looking to enjoy my football but i am starting to like it again because i am playing more games and the more i play the more i learn how chelsea play and i think the more i play the more confidence i will have

7227528 what a wonderful book diabetes can feel confusing and overwhelming but it doesnt have to be especially thanks to books like this
7227529 i take januvia and have for 6 months i have no side effects i have experienced a decrease in appetite i have had no headaches or respiratory problems my bg has gone down it is a great drug
7227530 januvia has been a positive thing for me my sugar levels dropped from 240 to 110 10 after fasting i have taken 100 mg once per day for a month i am not as hungry as before usage
7227531 ive been on januvia for a little over three months and have lost over 15 pounds which i had put on with actos ive experienced no side effects other than i am not hungry all of the time for me it has been very effective
7227532 i am substantially less hungry then i have felt in years and my bg hovers around 100 120 between meals fasting and 120 160 for a few hours after a heavy carb meal the usual bg spikes of 180 200 are completely gone
7227533 prior to taking januvia my bg was in the 160 to 180 range now it has gone up into the 260 to 300 range i feel ok but this cant be right
7227534 januvia is no picnic from the first time i took it felt as if i had a fever would shiver as if i was freezing after a week added getting dizzy to the mix spent the day in the hospital my enzymes were all messed up but got better as time went on within 2 days of stopping januvia all symptoms went away
7227535 januvia seems to have raised my blood sugar to unacceptable levels
7227536 i used januvia for a month and a half it worked well at first then my right knee swelled my left foot i could not walk on when i stopped taking januvia swelling went away it worked well at controlling my blood sugar levels but too much pain oh i never injured my knee or foot

7227541 we do not want a civilian president with the same powers that musharraf had mainly the power to dissolve parliament farooq said
7227542 our top priority is restoration of the judges and we want it done on monday farooq insisted adding that the party would meet in islamabad tomorrow to discuss developments
7227543 im really trying to just compartmentalize whats been going on personally
7227544 one of the reasons im here is because i know so many more lives are invested in this than just my own

7227546 the flooding is definitely something that we are monitoring and tracking and he was down there to see what kind of handle he could get on that

7227566 this choice of biden is disappointing because he is the creator of the idea of dividing iraq
7227567 we rejected his proposal when he announced it and we still reject it dividing the communities and land in such a way would only lead to new fighting between people over resources and borders iraq cannot survive unless it is unified and dividing it would keep the problems alive for a long time
7227568 the idea as in bosnia is to maintain a united iraq by decentralising it giving each ethno religious group kurd sunni arab and shiite arab room to run its own affairs
7227569 the kurdish sunni and shiite regions would each be responsible for their own domestic laws administration and internal security the central government would control border defence foreign affairs and oil revenues
7227570 the original biden plan seems less relevant in iraq today than at any point
7227571 the trend in parliament is clearly in a more national direction with political parties coming together across sectarian divides
7227572 in other words there is a very strong iraqi mobilisation against precisely the core elements of the biden plan and it would be extremely unwise of the democratic party to make bidens ideas the centrepiece of their iraq strategy
7227573 we dont support establishing federal regions on a sectarian basis for example our region is not ethnic it contains kurds and non kurds the regions should be established on a geographic basis
7227574 his project was the reason behind the unity of many political blocs that once differed in viewpoints
7227575 such a person if he would assume the vice presidency post would not serve to improve iraq usa relations
7227576 no i think she is hispanic some hispanics have darker complexions than others
7227577 our teams cant even get close to the area because it is in flames and the munitions are continuously exploding
7227578 the railway is vital not just for the georgian economy but for the economies of neighbouring countries
7227579 that is a very interesting question you should ask the club
7227580 he didnt play because he wasnt in the right condition this is what he told me before the game when i spoke to him so he did not play
7227581 well have to wait and see tomorrow sunday well speak to the player and then well make a decision on his future
7227582 its a situation that is very personal there are players able to play under these circumstances and others whose head is not right berbatov is in the latter category
7227583 well have a meeting with the player and clarify a few points and see if there is a decision to be made
7227584 well meet primarily to know if he is in any state to play in the next match or we have to find another solution
7227585 we wont be dancing in the streets in tottenham away from home well have a cup of tea and sandwich as normal
7227586 we fancy our chances and were happy with the progress were making players showed the other side to them
7227587 the character of the players is there for everyone to see we have that and you can criticise in other areas but not character
7227588 when youve won the game you say berbatovs a talented boy but darren bent is also a good player

7227593 potverdorie ik had hem nog zo verboden met zn vingers aan de spullen van zijn vader te komen
7227594 baas zou ik alstublieft indien het mogelijk is vrijdagmiddag vrijaf kunnen krijgen
7227595 i was very pleased with the first 15 minutes or so we created a lot of chances and could have scored a couple
7227596 but after that we did not play well and we allowed them to control our attacks they did not create too much themselves but it was not a good performance from our team
7227597 then in the second half they scored a good goal and we had to throw people forward to get ourselves back in the game
7227598 i am sure that jamie carragher will be claiming that goal despite the deflection but afterwards he was only really concerned that we had got ourselves level
7227599 but it was gerrard who showed the winning mentality he has done that so many times from a similar position many other players would have put it high over the bar but you know gerrard will hit the target
7227600 last season we drew far too many games at anfield but this time we have sent out a message that in such situations we can win the game we have winners here
7227601 we deserved more we certainly deserved a point we produced a disciplined performance and the two matches we have played so far have given me plenty of confidence
7227602 their equaliser was a freak and we should have been able to see out the game even at 1 1
7227603 but i have told them that they can leave anfield with their heads high
7227604 there are so many people supporting me caring about me helping me along the way and i am really sorry
7227605 i also didnt want to see this happen i thought of soldiering on but if i did that my tendon might have been permanently damaged i really could not do it at the moment i couldnt even put my feeling into words
7227606 i know i have the potential if only i let my injury recover i wont explain more i believe i will get better the main task for me at the moment is to get treatment for my injury there are other opportunities next year and years after that i must think positively i will not blame the circumstances and i do not give up easily i will pull myself together that is who i am

7227608 chinese athletes training is provided by the state so our final achievement should also belong to the state
7227609 lots of people say youre so stupid you could have auctioned that medal for millions of yuan
7227610 but i reckon that a gold medal belongs to the nation
7227611 now things from china often connote poor quality but it was not too long ago that it was the west looking to the east
7227612 blanc de chine reminds us that things produced in china were looked upon by europeans for quality and tasteful design instead of the cheapness that chinese products nowadays are associated with i thought it would be a good aspiration to do something of quality
7227613 had been more craft than art in a certain sense repeating the things that have been handed down for hundreds of years
7227614 at the time when we started blanc de chine garment design had been predominantly visually driven
7227615 we decided to go beyond that and try to explore the other senses whenever applicable
7227616 we take something from the past and look to the future to come up with something for the present
7227617 by recognizing the senses we invoke multidimensional interactions between the body and clothes
7227618 in order to be socially relevant adaptation and modifications are necessary otherwise the clothes become mere costumes
7227619 i dont think i can be competitive coming from the cheap end
7227620 if i were to do that i may as well put my investment in real estate which is more rewarding and less demanding when i first started and was paying attention to the insides of garments as well as the outsides even my son would give me dirty looks and said obviously i was not in the industry i have no sense of cost but i always believed that people would pay for a well designed garment

7227622 it was all first class flights fantastic hotels being greeted by thousands of people screaming being driven around in fast cars wow what a buzz
7227623 and wherever you went with the beatles thered be some sort of press conference with people asking the most inane questions
7227624 it was inspired by a dream i had about the beatles being ripped to shreds by all these young girls when they came out of a stadium
7227625 they werent allowed off that yacht until about 4am so do you really think theyre going to rush off to have breakfast with mrs marcos
7227626 it was very very humid and they were nothing like as happy as they were in japan but they performed brilliantly there
7227627 at the airport we were all jostled shoved pushed and it was carry your own bags theres no porters for you it upset the beatles a great deal
7227628 when we were on the plane waiting to take off there was complete silence in the first class cabin we didnt know whether we were all going to be dragged off and slung into prison when the engines started up and we were finally in the air there was such elation among all of us to get out of that f hole
7227629 it might have been one of the last nails in the touring coffin
7227630 i think we should challenge tamera http www tamera org and damanhur and all the other enlightened fabulous communities to take part of the share of collective development work invite them to whatsoever be it advanced solar collectors tensegrity tents germ development only one condition products are open source which means that there are no trade secrets and all art is public and they are useful for others
7227631 butcher cover sleeves went back into record stores with a new cover pasted over the old one and thousands of unwitting record buyers ended up purchasing albums whose covers could be peeled or steamed off to create what would become one of most sought after pieces of beatles memorabilia
7227632 the first album to present a new growing beatles to the world for the first time we began to think of albums as art on their own as complete entities
7227633 were all really fed up at taking what one had hoped would be designer friendly publicity pictures
7227634 it was inspired by our boredom and resentment at having to do another photo session and another beatles thing we were sick to death of it
7227635 his personal comment on the mass adulation of the group and the illusory nature of stardom
7227636 i had toured quite a lot of the world with them by then and i was continually amused by the public adulation of four people
7227637 my own thought was how the hell do you show that theyve been born out of a woman the same as anybody else an umbilical cord was one way of doing it
7227638 if you could imagine the background of that picture shouldve all been gold around the heads would have gone silver halos jeweled
7227639 i wanted to illustrate that in a way there was nothing more amazing about ringo than anyone else on this earth in this life he was just one of two million members of the human race the idolization of fans reminded me of the story of the worship of the golden calf
7227640 snatched away and eventually was pretty well taken out of context

7227686 well be at the united nations in march to beg them for help and make them really understand and recognise that this is a major problem and its just going to get worse

7227694 i couldnt do anything so i went into a ball i thought if hes coming over this is it all i had was a big knife my heart was beating out of my chest i thought it was a bear but it was a deer

7227702 more confused with the arrival of new labour and things in this country have become trickier with spin doctory and all the rest
7227703 its almost like the politicians are second guessing the jokes that the comedians are going to do political comedy changes all the time from swift onwards but there is a new generation now who are really tired of the system that is in place the cynical advertising and marketing that is so much politics these days

7227710 i will get an iphone only after my customers both those who have pre booked or are walking into stores to order them have been serviced
7227711 we see 5 per cent of our store sales through smartphones
7227712 and estimate to see iphones take this number a notch ahead
7227713 considering we have had thousands of online enquiries and bookings it looks like a promising start
7227714 apple personnel have spent weeks training our sales executives about iphone features and we are ready to crack sales
7227715 worldwide mobile service providers are fighting tooth and nail for the right to sell the new iphone because of its ability to attract new customers
7227716 at 720 or rs 31 000 for the 8gb model the pricing is steep as against the first iphone device that included contract subscriber subsidies in most international markets given this pricing twice as fast half the price which is the iphone tagline doesnt fit in the indian market context
7227717 with more affordable pricing iphone could garner a share of the consumer smartphone market
7227718 we are bundling the iphone with access to the airtel live portal a host of applications and 500 mb of data usage free with every purchase
7227719 i see no reason for iphone to fail in india
7227720 we expect to see volumes even at this pricing those who own a nokia n95 or blackberry devices priced at rs 20 000 could be the first movers to iphone
7227721 apple has everything to make inroads into rims most important customers large corporations thanks to new phones and software that connects to microsofts exchange email calendar servers
7227722 if we go by similar experiences internationally the initial uptake of iphone is likely to be encouraging with sales over the next 12 months depending on customer feedback and product pricing
7227723 we think we have a real winner with our new iphone 3g and were busy finishing several more wonderful new products to launch in the coming months
7227724 over 10 million nokia n series and almost 2 million nokia e series devices in the second quarter 2008
7227725 we will price the gaming applications between rs 40 and rs 200 around 4 99
7227726 app store will make the iphone more attractive for users in the same way that itunes helped make the ipod a success
7227727 despite the global downturn flattening the growth of personal debt and uk gdp over the past few quarters debt levels continue to grow at a faster rate than the income the uk generates
7227728 although there is no cause for panic as personal debt is well covered by the uk housing stock the figures clearly illustrate the continuing problem of growing personal debt levels in the uk

7227802 visto come stava dice il suo tecnico luciano gigliotti come voto gli do 10 oggi baldini stato stoico e ha dimostrato di avere veramente gli attributi
7227803 con linfortunio che ha avuto un altro non sarebbe partito oggi stefano ci ha messo lanima ed stato grande ha corso in condizioni menomate ed alla fine era uno dei pi freschi
7227804 dopo diciotto anni di carriera questa la mia ultima maratona non solo con la maglia della nazionale ma proprio in assoluto il piacere di correre c ancora ma il fisico non mi regge pi troppi infortuni e non mi sembra il caso dinsistere
7227805 che io debba chiudere con la gara pi lunga insiste lo dimostra anche questa maratona mi ero preparato alla grande ma appena ho dovuto mettere quel qualcosa in pi che serviva per rimanere ad alto livello sono arrivati i problemi si vede che il fisico ha raggiunto il suo limite
7227806 correre anche ogni settimana una cosa che in questi anni di maratone mi mancato adesso vorrei riprendere quei ritmi
7227807 un po quello che bordin ed altri sono stati per me
7227808 ci vorranno almeno dieci anni prevede coach gigliotti prima di tirar fuori un campione come baldini se lo troveremo elementi interessanti come lalli e meucci non sembrano convinti di puntare sulla maratona per quelli ancor pi giovani c il vuoto assoluto del resto basta andare nelle scuole e si nota che i nostri ragazzini sono quasi tutti obesi i keniani vincono perch hanno strutture motorie diverse ma anche tanta fame
7227809 gli africani senza dubbio hanno una marcia in pi e anche molta pi disponibilit al sacrificio
7227810 credo sia giusto chiudere cos continua baldini e peccato per gli intoppi fisici degli ultimi mesi ad aprile e nei giorni scorsi senza questi problemi avrei ottenuto in risultato migliore non so se avrei potuto lottare per il podio perch davanti sono andati davvero forte ma nei primi otto sarei sicuramente entrato il baldini di atene se la sarebbe giocata con il keniano magari uno dei due avrebbe staccato laltro negli ultimi chilometri oppure ci saremmo giocati la medaglia doro in volata

7227893 the ability to bring in hundreds of thousands of volunteers to different sites not only in beijing but also qingdao where the sailing events were staged hong kong equestrian and other cities is something that numbers wise is not going to be easy for london
7227894 i believe london has unique assets if you look at the games each games have special identities
7227895 athens in 2004 was a return to the roots the country that has invented the olympic games china was coming to the most populous country of the world
7227896 london will be the city of the country that has invented modern sports the country that has invented the rules of sport and brought in the values of fair play that is the identity that has to be used in london

7227981 ayurveda unani greek medicine even the chinese concept of yin and yang record the fact that different food items generate different levels of heat in ones body and affect ones emotional well being satvik food helps control the emotions of a person and makes him more relaxed
7227982 it is not meant for people from all walks of life it is suited to those who choose to lead the path of self growth and emotional consciousness on the other hand you cant live on a diet of butter chicken and beer all the time that is why people bring about a conscious change in their diets during religious festivals
7227983 they pray to god and fast this combined with a satvik diet paves the way for spiritual well being
7227984 but if you had to choose between an american hash brown and a tikki a flavoured indian potato dish for a satvik meal the choice would obviously be the tikki because one cant separate food from tradition
7227985 satvik cooking is easy and full of flavour contrary to popular belief spices like cumin and coriander are often used only certain spices and ingredients need to be avoided eating such food also gives the body and digestive system a much needed break
7227986 one should always think of the body as a gift from god so one should always attempt to eat satvik
7227987 this may not appeal to many people who are too absorbed in their lives to care about eating habits surely one can find time to attend to habits that influence our soul in a negative manner this should be done routinely not just during festivals

7228057 everybody is playing politics in the valley over the allotment and then cancellation of land to the amarnath shrine board the mess has given a tool to the vested interests to vitiate atmosphere inside and outside the valley
7228058 no reasonable justification is being offered as to why the land was first allotted and the reason to cancel the allotment it is a total mess
7228059 such vacillation on the part of the government led to the peoples polarisation along religious lines the forces always ready to fish in troubled waters have compounded the problem
7228060 there is no alternative to talking to the people of the state i am sorry to say that the government did not adopt a correct approach in addressing the crisis
7228061 the all party meeting should have preceded a series of parleys with the agitating people without going into the peoples psyche we cannot have a lasting remedy to any problem nothing should be thrust upon the people of the state
7228062 a decision has to be evolved through mutual consensus of the states people thankfully the situation has not yet taken a communal shape the challenge before the government is how to restore peace without straining peoples relationship
7228063 the whole affair should be managed by the people of jammu and kashmir till a separate board was created to oversee the annual event the government was managing the show there was not a single incident of communal violence
7228064 it will now take some time for the states economy to pick up

7228071 estamos preocupados seriamente con este tema y estamos haciendo llamamientos constantes al gobierno socialista para que tome medidas porque no puede abandonar a la gente a su suerte

7228168 and that you may love the lord your god listen to his voice and hold fast to him for the lord is your life and he will give you many years in the land he swore to give to your fathers abraham isaac and jacob
7228169 praise be to the god and father of our lord jesus christ the father of compassion and the god of all comfort who comforts us in all our troubles so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from god
7228170 dont worry about anything instead pray about everything tell god what you need and thank him for all he has done if you do this you will experience gods peace which is far more wonderful than the human mind can understand his peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in christ jesus
7228171 many are the plans in a mans heart but it is the lords purpose that prevails
7228172 have i not commanded you be strong and courageous do not be terrified do not be discouraged for the lord your god will be with you wherever you go
7228173 plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you hope and a future
7228174 the lord is my rock my fortress and my deliverer my god is my rock in whom i take refuge he is my shield and the horn of my salvation my stronghold
7228175 yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of god but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to god being fully persuaded that god had power to do what he had promised
7228176 but beloved do not forget this one thing that with the lord one day is as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day
7228177 i tell you the truth if you have faith as small as a mustard seed you can say to this mountain move from here to there and it will move nothing will be impossible for you
7228178 and without faith it is impossible to please god because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him
7228179 for it is with your heart that you believe and are justified and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved
7228180 see god has come to save me i will trust in him and not be afraid
7228181 is anyone among you suffering let him pray is anyone cheerful let him sing psalms is anyone among you sick let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him will oil in the name of the lord

7228188 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7228189 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7228190 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7228191 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7228192 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7228193 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

7228196 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7228197 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7228198 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7228199 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7228200 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7228201 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7228202 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7228203 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7228204 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7228205 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7228206 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7228207 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7228208 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7228209 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7228210 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7228211 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7228212 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7228213 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7228214 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7228215 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7228216 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7228217 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7228218 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7228219 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7228220 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7228221 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7228222 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7228223 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7228224 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7228225 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7228226 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7228227 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7228228 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7228229 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7228230 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7228231 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7228232 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7228233 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7228234 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7228235 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7228236 who are open to doing something on the production side
7228237 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7228238 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7228239 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7228240 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7228241 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7228242 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7228243 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7228244 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7228245 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7228246 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7228247 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7228248 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7228249 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7228250 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7228251 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7228252 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7228253 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7228254 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7228255 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7228256 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7228257 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7228258 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7228259 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7228260 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7228261 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7228262 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7228263 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7228264 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7228265 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7228266 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7228267 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7228268 see the world visit london celebrates a historic moment for our capital the olympic handover the campaign celebrates our city in a unique way capturing our truly global status and underpinning the importance of london as the number one international tourist destination

7228276 your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk about what you need thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7228277 and dont talk to me about him being an ex marine
7228278 lord that was 40 years ago a lot of stuff can happen in 40 years
7228279 you also become aware of the need to put only nutritional foods and substances into your stomach knowing that your baby receives and absorbs and grows in a healthy manner because of the effects of the healthy foods that you put into your stomach
7228280 my belief is that the 12 volt charger caught fire and from there it would have expanded and damaged a few television sets if its not the fire it was water
7228281 i think that gpl is the culprit i had this very problem last year when lots of lights and equipment were damaged but i did not report the matter because its a waste of time
7228282 when a circle breeze blow its horrible you can feel the smoke and nastiness in yuh stomach
7228283 when we get inside he was already dead like he tie the hammock rope on the window grill and wrap it around his neck
7228284 he is a good boy and i really love him i cant believe that he did this to me
7228285 i cant tell you it would be in a matter of weeks and months not much longer
7228286 i dont think who co ordinated the joint services response really knew what they were doing they allowed the element of surprise to reign but they needed to track these men immediately and if you are doing this you cant leave out the main trail
7228287 it is not just the children back home because i came here today and asked the young children and only one boy knew who anancy was our children are not reading our own classic tales
7228288 in the second round i drew with some 15 year old boy from some village somewhere i think his name was abhijeet gupta
7228289 we have reached the limits and in my view we have got to make economies i think we have reached the end of the road the british people are well ahead of the politicians on this and know that the money is not being spent wisely
7228290 it is up to the leadership of the conservative party how they present these things but the facts of life are if you allow public expenditure to grow more rapidly peoples living standards will continue to fall and our ability to recover will diminish
7228291 therefore we need to do in government what people are doing in their business and private lives which is to cut our cloth
7228292 my consultant said the cancer had got so big it filled half my womb there was a chance it was in my bloodstream
7228293 she told me id need a hysterectomy radiotherapy and chemotherapy the biggest shock was when i asked what would have happened if id stayed in india for three months without hesitation she replied jade you would have died ive got to make a joke about it or ill go mad with the fear if i go bald ill get a big tattoo on my head and i refuse to question whether or not i will die its not an option ill fight with all my strength
7228294 at least annually and within nine months of the end of each fiscal year on the results of his audit of the consolidated financial statements and the accounts of budget agencies in relation to that fiscal year
7228295 fundamentally because of a lack of information and timely reconciliation
7228296 was within the national sectors previously identified and in accordance with the guidelines for access to the lottery funding
7228297 i am sure that the minister of finance would want that to happen i am not sure when that is going to happen
7228298 it was not treated as an agency which is expected to peruse the accounts of all the other government agencies and departments in this country and hence no consideration was given to the fact that the audit office was in dire need of staff
7228299 we have to try and save it because no nation can live without its culture
7228300 spero un giorno di riuscire a realizzare con mio figlio brando un progetto che non sono mai riuscito a concretizzare sulla storia damore fra mia madre e mio padre intitolato la porta del cielo magari lasciando la regia a brando
7228301 intanto questanno vengo a venezia per vedere ladri di biciclette restaurato e presentato alla mostra in occasione del sessantesimo anniversario della sua prima proiezione in un paese che dimentica facilmente ricordare un film in un evento cos importante un grande onore un riconoscimento doveroso mio padre ci ha perso un sacco di soldi ma alla fine stato risarcito con il restauro del suo capolavoro sicuramente da lass sar contento di questo regalo
7228302 oh i guess its fated that we are not togethr anymore
7228303 oh i dno man let nature take its course all i can do now is rely on fate
7228304 while we were slow dancing my crush and i had our first kiss
7228305 on one date the girl said to me i dont kiss on the first date so i said i dont follow the rules ooooh it was so good
7228306 this sponsorship was a result of that performance and if he can keep up the winning ways more sponsorship will be on the table from not only clear waters but other businesses as well
7228307 this time though i intend to do better this time i know what to do
7228308 people who know me will im sure tell me afterwards you look nervous
7228309 and i am im telling you im getting a real case of the heebie jeebies now
7228310 im like joe im a little nervous on the inside
7228311 this is not an easy thing to do weve bet the whole farm on this safe landing and we cant do our science without the safe landing weve really worked so hard to build our science instruments our rationale for why were going our procedures for doing all the science and yet we have this hurdle to get over before we can do it and thats what makes us nervous
7228312 im telling you im getting a real case of the heebie jeebies now
7228313 each of those can be of very high reliability 99 5 or 99 9 percent but the problem is that when you have something that has to happen in a very short period of time all of them have to work and you dont have another chance you start stacking those one after the other
7228314 thats probably the most nerve wracking part of this you stack so many things back to back that have to happen successfully and thats what drives us to distraction in the last seven minutes
7228315 overall i feel the team is well prepared for landing and the events thereafter but theres still a large amount of things that have to go right in order for us start making progress on the surface mission and science
7228316 it was better than we could have possibly wished for
7228317 everything locked up the way we wanted over and over again we rehearsed all the problems and none of them occurred it went perfectly just the way we designed it
7228318 it went better than any of the tests and simulations that we had run
7228319 this is never routine and its never going to be routine
7228320 phoenix has always seemed to be a bit of an underdog mission
7228321 being a stationary three legged lander it doesnt tend to have the allure that spirit and opportunity have had additionally weve been living in the shadow of the much larger and more ambitions mars science laboratory mission scheduled for launch next year
7228322 phoenix has always seemed to be a bit of an underdog mission
7228323 being a stationary three legged lander it doesnt tend to have the allure that spirit and opportunity have had
7228324 i had the unique honor to cancel this spacecraft in 2000 youre looking at the guy who said this spacecraft wasnt safe to fly
7228325 how many times in a career do you get to cancel a mission peter smith comes back to me and says ive got a way to fly this safely you get to reselect it and you get to be here and see it land wow
7228326 so the kids who did them are now grown ups perhaps with children of their own
7228327 today you had a chance to watch a team in action making something that is incredibly hard to do look easy and you know they are the most expert of the experts when they can do that
7228328 the way were going to land humans on mars is with propulsive systems and landing legs
7228329 so this is another good step to show that what we did 32 years ago with viking we still know how to do
7228330 so there are a lot of very happy people all over the country to see the solar arrays deployed on mars
7228331 seven minutes of terror are going to be followed by three months of joy
7228332 i sent an email out to the entire team this morning talking about the fact that aside from the obvious that this is the best team ive ever worked with and that theyre all so dedicated that weve done something that has never been done in human history and that is land north of the arctic circle on mars
7228333 after this press conference im going home to get some sleep
7228334 seven minutes of terror are going to be followed by three months of joy
7228335 ziel ist es das stadion in eine festung zu verwandeln die eine basis f r viele punkte liefert
7228336 er hat gut trainiert und die freiheiten genutzt die er in leverkusen nicht hatte ich hoffe dass er sich austobt
7228337 wir m ssen die aufbruchsstimmung die hier herrscht mit in das spiel nehmen die anspannung ist da aber das ist positiv das ist ein vorstartzustand der sich wenn es losgeht entl dt wenn wir 92 93 minuten leidenschaft und einsatzwillen hochhalten werden wir das spiel gewinnen
7228338 der rauswurf in k ln hatte mir wehgetan ich war mit leib und seele fc trainer wir hatten eine tolle mannschaft ich hatte lange mit dem fc im kopf nicht abgeschlossen

7228342 some are glad to see the growth and some hate to see it
7228343 we have the responsibility to take care of this planet
7228344 we must extend love to all creatures trees and beautiful things
7228345 we need to take a bolder policy agenda to meet peoples material concerns and thats why this policy resonates across the social spectrum
7228346 there are millions of people suffering from fuel poverty and its the job of a labour government to tackle that
7228347 politically we also have to contrast that with the tories
7228348 cameron has fashioned a new conservative language but his attachment to the market means he cant actually make britain a fairer society he can only talk about it
7228349 he should be taken into custody for hitting her down
7228350 he hit her with a rod ripped her uniform in thapathali kathmandu nepal at busy hour but nobody could help even uniformed police
7228351 most doctors and nurses are unaware of these differences that has life threatening consequences for women
7228352 the programme policies and other issues will be clear soon
7228353 we did not discuss seat sharing but how to evolve the organisation third front together
7228354 the proposal is that the new 14 universities will introduce a four year under graduate course with direct mobility to ph d those who want to do ma they can as well do so by additional one year course after four year graduation
7228355 the conventional method is a long route the new proposal on ph d would cut short on m phil and masters
7228356 i would encourage indian libraries to develop partnerships with other libraries a concept which is very easy and simple with modern technology
7228357 library professionals and librarians can benefit immensely from keeping themselves abreast of new technologies in library usage
7228358 across the world libraries have contributed to the improvement in the quality of life of its citizens and have provided them many opportunities for gaining knowledge and for intellectual advancement

7228364 die mannschaft hat zu wenig zutrauen in sich gezeigt wenn man die m glichkeit bekommt die bayern zu schlagen muss man es auch tun wir haben bekommen was wir verdient haben mit dem punkt m ssen wir leben
7228365 zu beginn hat ihre mannschaft die fans beeindruckt wieso spielte sie sp ter wie gel hmt
7228366 die anfangsphase war wirklich sehr gut wir waren lebendig und aktiv haben ein unglaublich sch nes tor erzielt wenn man aber das zweite tor nicht macht wird es schwer ich bin deshalb mit unserem spiel nicht zufrieden
7228367 ihre abwehr war im durchschnitt unter 21 jahre alt hatte insgesamt weniger als 40 bundesliga spiele absolviert war dies nicht ein wagnis
7228368 wir wollen kein mitleid f r unsere abwehr die jungs haben hinten sensationell gerettet marcel schmelzer hat das super gemacht mein sohn ist auch von 1988 da wusste ich schon dass das ein sensationeller jahrgang ist
7228369 k mpferisch war der auftritt lange zeit berzeugend doch am ende hatten die bayern sogar noch siegchancen
7228370 wir waren der unangenehme gegner der wir ja auch sein wollten das ist wichtig leider haben wir den sack nicht zugemacht das ist bedauerlich
7228371 we want people to feel as though theyre guests in our own house

7228386 jee has spawned a system that reduces young people to automatons in more sense than one they not only become robots in academics as all of us can see in our core teaching encounters they even resemble one another in personality gone are the sparkling eyes and scintillating engagements that used to be the teachers joy in our core programme today our students are distinguishable from one another only by their cpis in terms of personality they constitute a grey canvas devoid of colours
7228387 why we cannot sustain a vibrant extracurricular life without coercion
7228388 the fact that of the scores of replies i have received from faculty all around the world including stanford your reply is the first one which is so discouraging is proof enough that i am not spamming the fact remains that professors doing interesting work are always on the lookout for bright students who could assist them in their work and for many of these professors hiring foreign students is an option the case with stanford seems to be different and i respect your commitment towards the internship needs of your in house students but you should not term this as spamming i cannot be expected to know about stanfords policy without actually communicating with the people over there
7228389 of course there are some schools so weak that they cannot attract qualified enrolled students of their own and they might be willing to take on a non admitted student but you will learn more at an iit than at one of those schools

7228591 tennis is the passion of all of us at delwood and our personal long term friendship with many of the players has enabled us to pull off such a successful first event
7228592 we thought that because dubai has such great atp and wta tour events the legends would be an added value to tennis in the uae
7228593 firstly everyone can relate to senior s tennis if you have followed the careers of the stars its nostalgic to see them again they are all still artists in some way
7228594 secondly tennis is entertainment and thats what we are interested in tennis has to be fun
7228595 there is recognised five a side indoor hardly any activity on offer in football game played dubai that caters to families professionally in more than 70 concerts horse races golf and countries to the region to this rugby are for adults but the end delwood has already harlem globetrotters fascinate hosted the futsal cup a 16 the five year old as much as his team competition at hayya or her grandparents its the meadows village and a perfect show you dont want permanent adults futsal league to miss it and you want to see it staring in late 2006 because again as soon as you have it is played indoors futsal experienced it once it is is a natural choice for the uae the perfect combination of and delwoods goal is to fun entertainment and nurture the game in the competitive sport
7228596 we always try to secure stronger and fitter as such the company plans communications strategies in a market the best the best venue the best to bring the futsal concept into the education already awash with corporate hospitality entertainment the best food and so on
7228597 delwood will always be interested in trendy championship currently in its fifth year which as to how they can complement and not sports and sports that cater to families but has become the biggest international junior compete with each other the sky is the limit they have to fit in with our objectives just like tournament in the gcc with more than 200 he says
7228598 bill gates has changed the world by taking areas and if you take a look at what the the category four event supports grass the concept you are what you give to its uae has to offer today and what is missing roots tennis in the uae and gives local talent a logical end companies sharing their multi you might guess the next big project we have chance to compete at the international level million dollar profits with those who are less in mind

7228600 making all are the dubai centre for special needs the parties involved understand this is our little dreams foundation and the king hussein tel 9714 368 1548 main challenge
7228601 we have always endeavoured to provide cherish the film cameras
7228602 they are from the solutions for effective communications all days of films when there were only films over productions be it corporate videos tv the years i have seen television video and commercials training films induction the internet emerge putting communications videos documentaries television content and media on the fast track every day i am generation they all reflect our strong belief learning and our company has moved with in storytelling
7228603 our team of qualified and all work the old cameras are examples of experienced cinematographers editors the mans passion and love for his work they technicians are all film school graduates and are a connoisseurs delight adept in all aspects of filmmaking with an moviemedia has been adept at creatively experience of more than 28 years in the gulf tailoring its services to a clients needs but itself we bring to the productions the please do not use the word one stop shop understanding gained over the years
7228604 at moviemedia we are primarily accountable for our productions moviemedia has tapped into this new emerging media to give value we want our clients and audience to know that it is a moviemedia added service to its clients production our association is not a standard client production house webcasting is the new service that we are providing to our clients relationship we are all on the same side as partners we create and for many it is very new in this region from live webcasting of events productions and simultaneously educate that helps us in retaining and to special video clips messages and company news updates we do it creating long term associations
7228605 we firmly believe that our combination of passion ingenuity skill and a high top of the mind recall value from content generation experience and accountability is the best way to ensure that our through content management and hosting moviemedia can provide a productions result in making the difference
7228606 our focus is on customer relationship management or crm as it is known
7228607 one2ones ethos is all about getting to know your customers better and actively managing relations with them on an individual basis this kind of communication which is specifically targeted and relevant to the end consumers buying profile and habits assists us in exposing new brands to potential audiences it also serves in informing existing customers that their business is valued and appreciated by highlighting special offers and promotions in a timely and relevant way
7228608 a crm programme is not just simply having a database we must work with retailers to shift their perceptions into operating crm initiatives beyond that loyalty schemes of any description must also be a long term commitment and an integral part of the overall marketing communications strategy which values the intrinsic lifetime worth of each individual customer after all we are asking customers to identify themselves to a company or brand there is a great deal of trust given by the customer when they choose to impart their personal information and it is up to us to incentivise them to make it worth their while and then to manage this information in an effective and appropriate manner we employ cutting edge data mining technologies which are rated the best in the world and programme accounting to provide accurate reporting and dynamic multi dimensional segmentation of the customer database
7228609 this enables us to truly personalise offers to the most appropriate and relevant individuals and differentiate marketing communications to the most pertinent target audiences
7228610 the communication process is dependent on client requirements and strategy but the enormous benefit is that in the case of shopping malls it allows the tenant and the property owner to operate under a fixed marketing budget
7228611 most crm systems are typically sourced by it or card manufacturers and as such are constrained by their pre set operational parameters
7228612 the main difference with the graphicard system is that it has been developed from a complete marketing perspective so it has taken the need for flexibility timeliness and the need to tailor personalised messages to different target audiences into consideration
7228613 this allows us to be spontaneous and to capture the right mood right now in the right environment mentality of many shoppers

7228640 when you play as a striker it is always like this
7228641 when you stop playing it is difficult to come back and play again you need rhythm even more when you are a striker because you need confidence if you dont have confidence you are nothing
7228642 i dont think i am back to my best yet i am still looking to enjoy my football but i am starting to like it again because i am playing more games and the more i play the more i learn how chelsea play and i think the more i play the more confidence i will have
7228643 you cant write chelsea off when it comes to the title it was so close last season it went right down to the wire
7228644 it is clear that china has put the bar very high
7228645 its going to be a challenge for london and also for all subsequent games i believe and my hope will be that london will put the bar higher
7228646 there are issues that london will not be able to copy or equal
7228647 the ability to bring in hundreds of thousands of volunteers to different sites not only in beijing but also qingdao where the sailing events were staged hong kong equestrian and other cities is something that numbers wise is not going to be easy for london
7228648 i believe london has unique assets if you look at the games each games have special identities
7228649 athens in 2004 was a return to the roots the country that has invented the
7228650 london will be the city of the country that has invented modern sports the country that has invented the rules of sport and brought in the values of fair play that is the identity that has to be used in london
7228651 london is also a very cosmopolitan city multi ethnic multi cultural multi religious this is also an asset
7228652 the rest i have absolutely no concern the venues will be first class
7228653 sure it is about sport but we will also take the chance to showcase the creative capital that london is buying a laptop

7228662 the timing of course is simply the timing of when the agreement was completed
7228663 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
7228664 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
7228665 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats
7228666 fighting intensified overnight with battles raging near the towns of datu saudi ampatuan and datu piang all in maguindanao province
7228667 we have done our best to embrace peace but the milf started the hostilities by pillaging villages and murdering innocent civilians in mindanao
7228668 now we are implementing the full force of the law and we will arrest those responsible for the traitorous attacks against civilians
7228669 this is a grim scenario and i dont even want to think about it but if the peace talks collapse then there will be war again in mindanao
7228670 the voice of reason is dwarfed by the voice of hatred and prejudice
7228671 the peace talks are slowly breaking apart and if this continues may god help us all
7228672 we have also called in the army to assist the police in enforcing law and order
7228673 they were taken under the threat of firearms it was an abduction
7228674 its clear that they were kidnapped because their schedule was to come back to the hotel before 12 in the afternoon and we dont have their whereabouts
7228675 we contacted the place where they were heading but so far they havent seen them
7228676 we are deeply concerned that our son nigel brennan may have gone missing near mogadishu in somalia yesterday
7228677 he is a freelance photographer who arrived in kenya just over a week ago
7228678 we understand that the australian government is making urgent contact with relevant somalian authorities as well as the canadian french and british embassies to help locate nigel
7228679 has deplored the recent killings of innocent victims and the resulting displacement of people in kismayo
7228680 he said that the fighting was to control the port for resource generation and not as portrayed in some places a political or other issue
7228681 kismayo is relatively calm today saturday but residents in janayabdale village reported new clashes in the area
7228682 the remnants of the clan militias and some of their commanders tried to cross janayabdale where they encountered an attack from the islamists several people were injured in the clashes
7228683 there was some sporadic gunfire overnight from friday to saturday but no fighting
7228684 the major battle is over but the militiamen that were dislodged by islamists may try their luck to regain the town
7228685 our teams cant even get close to the area because it is in flames and the munitions are continuously exploding
7228686 the railway is vital not just for the georgian economy but for the economies of neighbouring countries
7228687 the war against terrorism is our own war and it will continue until its logical end
7228688 most players didnt perform to their best level because of the heat
7228689 of course it was not the same spectacle as it would have been with an evening kick off really it was very hot and the players felt it
7228690 we came with the plan of winning the gold medal and weve done it
7228691 it was a beautiful experience i enjoyed some moments which were very different to the ones we are used to

7228708 los rivales fueron superiores y no se hizo bien ni al nivel esperado es una l stima porque ha sido en valencia
7228709 sean 7 u 11 millones la cantidad de pobres sigue siendo alta
7228710 sugiere que hay un reconocimiento impl cito de la pobreza
7228711 si el indec agreg dice que la pobreza baj del 26 9 por ciento al 20 7 por ciento a marzo de 2008 es contradictorio que haya un aumento tan importante de los planes asistenciales de desarrollo social
7228712 el gobierno fue ineficaz para reducir la pobreza la tendencia de reducci n de los ndices se alter a pesar del incremento de recursos oficiales no repercute tanto en los sectores m s desprotegidos sobre todo por el crecimiento de los precios
7228713 el desaf o es reducir la pobreza la argentina est en condiciones fiscales de dise ar una pol tica acorde con el problema
7228714 hoy tenemos un problema significativo y recursos importantes el asunto es c mo se usan los fondos una salida puede ser un sistema de protecci n social acorde con los problemas del pa s y darle un enfoque de derecho al modelo de protecci n social esto es para reducir las posibilidades de que el dinero sea utilizado discrecionalmente y con fines clientelistas
7228715 se puede tener un sistema de pol tica social m s integrado en el que el factor aglutinador sea el trabajo que es el elemento importante para crear pol ticas p blicas
7228716 tenemos la oportunidad de acercar las dos cosas tenemos dinero y pobres la argentina est en una etapa hist rica
7228717 los planes sociales tienen una incidencia en la reducci n de la pobreza pero tambi n ayud el crecimiento econ mico
7228718 pobreza no es solamente lo econ mico sino que se trata de que la persona tenga acceso a la educaci n la salud y el trabajo estamos en un proceso de pasar de los planes netamente asistencialistas a otro que brinde oportunidades laborales
7228719 desde m xico 1968 por en 1984 no estuvo el bloque sovi tico no ten amos dos medallas de oro
7228720 es buena no es lo que pa s necesita pero podemos dar mucho m s
7228721 tuvimos resultados que han sido muy positivos las dos medallas de oro y la de bronce el gran impulso del tiro con arco voleibol de playa que va a dar mucho en el pr ximo ciclo y que nos entrega un resultado bueno
7228722 es algo muy positivo tenemos que darle un seguimiento a todos ellos tener 22 entre el noveno y decimosexto habla de que tenemos mucho m s mexicanos entre los mejores 20 del mundo
7228723 profundizar la contenci n social a las familias en riesgo garantizando subsidios al desempleo y asistencia alimentaria consolidando una verdadera red federal de pol ticas sociales integrales para que quienes se encuentran por debajo de la l nea de pobreza puedan tener acceso a la educaci n a la salud p blica y a la vivienda
7228724 sabemos que hay que corregir errores y mejorar m todos en la forma de asignaci n de la ayuda social pero es imprescindible advertir que la tragedia c vica del clientelismo pol tico no es producto de la asistencia social como gesti n del estado sino de la desocupaci n como consecuencia de un modelo econ mico
7228725 en nuestro pa s agreg la aparici n de la figura del cliente pol tico es coet nea con la del desocupado mientras en la rep blica argentina hubo trabajo nadie fue reh n de un dirigente partidario
7228726 queremos que el gobierno acepte que se siente a discutir y abandone los resentimientos buena parte de los instrumentos por las pol ticas hacia el sector se van a parir en el congreso y en ese lugar vamos a ir a buscar las leyes que hagan falta a partir de los primeros d as de septiembre
7228727 el paro agropecuario llegar como un recurso si el gobierno no sabe resolver los problemas
7228728 la pol tica que aplican los kirchner es un obst culo
7228729 se devolvi el protagonismo a las instituciones como el congreso espero que los legisladores nos sigan acompa ando y ahora ser seguramente por la ganader a el campo sigue con las manos vac as los tiempos se agotan y las respuestas son insuficientes
7228730 somos el pa s de la carne pero en esta actividad vamos a tener que importar carne en tres o cuatro a os
7228731 sabemos que hay expertas en vacas como se declar a s misma cristina kirchner pero por qu carajo no hacen pol ticas ganaderas que sirvan al pa s no queremos que nos sometan eso anduvo bien en santa cruz pero ac en la argentina sic no va a andar
7228732 hasta ahora result imposible darse una organicidad como espacio pol tico depend amos de gobernadores o de intendentes en funciones que no ten an voluntad de romper con la ucr o tiempo para dedicarse a un armado pol tico
7228733 los pensamos sumar cuando ellos quieran pero no los vamos a apurar
7228734 el modelo de concertaci n es el que kirchner convoc en 2006 en la plaza de mayo que tiene que ver con el sentido de productividad que debe tener la sociedad con la profunda responsabilidad en la distribuci n
7228735 vamos a competir en 2009 con listas nicas o complementarias al kirchnerismo pero dentro del mismo proyecto
7228736 pero ac no importa el ahorro en s sino el cambio de tendencia ascendente de subsidios

7228740 queremos que las grandes marcas de indumentaria se hagan cargo de la protecci n de los trabajadores del sector
7228741 ah terminaban ganando porque el tallerista no asum a ninguna responsabilidad ya que aparec a como trabajador en relaci n de dependencia de la gran marca
7228742 si no hay inspecci n la norma no se cumple
7228743 pero nosotros empezamos la gesti n con 20 inspectores y ahora tenemos 400 antes no se inspeccionaba ning n taller y ahora vamos por los 6500
7228744 habr una comisi n que establecer precios por prendas y va a haber un piso que deber ser igual o superior a la categor a similar del convenio correspondiente estar n los gremios textil de indumentaria los cortadores y del calzado
7228745 no habr ajuste fiscal de fondo ni cambios de rumbo por un a o ya est n muy cerca las elecciones de 2009
7228746 no habr cambios de fondo en el rumbo de la econom a

7228797 property is a function of propriety there are no unalienable human rights in nature there are only the principles of physics biology and instinctual animal behavior so the right to property is a social convention that exists only so far as that society is willing to recognize and defend it by force where necessary it is a form of propriety in the same manner as the exclusivity of a sexual relationship or notions of religious taboo thus property does not exist outside the context of community as the many refugees we have created today have learned in tragic fashion we have today bureaucratized the disposition of property rights to such an extreme that people often pretend these rights are laws of nature until they personally confront the casual disregard for these rights by government authorities and discover how limited their options for recourse really are in early societies property rights were much more fluid much more negotiable because social equity was critical to community stability the extremes of social and economic inequity common in todays bureaucratic macro communities could not exist in the small communities of the past because there were no mechanisms to shield individuals from the social repercussions of greed and nothing to stop the majority from simply taking property from individuals by force where needs demanded and those individuals resisted their ultimate responsibility to the society as i suggested this earlier fluidity of property rights is reflected in the very organic architecture of ancient and contemporary primary culture communities today the disposition of real estate is based on a bureaucratic virtualization of the landscape the imposition of quadratic and earlier ad hoc free form divisions keyed to natural landmarks grids on the national territory which allow a nation state to parcel off land as a commodity and distribute it in various ways but in the past the physical territory of a community was defined by the scale of the population and the productivity of group labor there was no virtual grid on this territory and no fixed boundaries or locations of homes territory was defined by the actual use of space villages would tend to be defined in general structure by central public activity spaces plazas atriums etc and perimeter enclosures intended primarily as defense against wild animal intrusions with dwellings tending to be organized in rings along this enclosure and surrounding in turn the central communal open space where a persons home would be within the village and how much space it could have was determined by group consensus and limited by the precedent of earlier homes and the communitys available labor pool you could negotiate for as much space as the labor pool at any time could afford since the individual contribution of labor per person would be roughly the same per new home added but precedent in size of previous homes and the free area left in an outer enclosure limited how far you could push that because existing residents would want just as much space to be fair and maintaining equity with increases in size could mean reconstruction of much of a village the less freely adaptive the construction method the more vernacular traditions on size and design of dwellings tended to be worked out across a generational perspective what ones needs were most likely to be across the human life cycle in respect to marriage procreation and so on the creation or reconfiguration of homes in a village was typically associated with marriage and the expectation of children that would produce type of building technology could also influence the nature of this p2p negotiation the nature of communal labor and ultimately notions of property and propriety the two oldest forms of construction both going back at least 10 000 years in the archeological record were masonry construction adobe cob earth block rubble piled stone cut stone based on earthen materials and pavilion or pole structures based largely on organic materials both technologies were largely ubiquitous but the former often in hybrid forms dominated in the northern hemisphere the latter in the southern hemisphere owing to the differences in predominate climate and materials resources this of course is why the archeological record is far more robust in the northern hemisphere masonry structures tended to be very resilient and thus very permanent and they are extremely labor intensive to build the labor intensiveness favored architecture with shared walls as this saved some labor in expansion and in many of the climates where this was used would also help conserve thermal energy so contiguous structure was common they also tended to favor contiguous monolithic wall structures as a means of limiting insect animal intrusion and potentially as defense against human attackers or a means of limiting their routes of intrusion during fighting such heavy structures took longer to build were more labor intensive to modify and tended to be easier to expand than to demolish and rebuild and so tended to favor incremental expansion over whole adaptation they also offered very high degrees of personal privacy by providing good visual and sound barriers thus communities evolved at much slower generational paces and p2p negotiation over community construction was more protracted and eventually formalized this may partly account for the cultures of the northern hemisphere having much more rigid concepts of property and propriety structural permanence leads to notions of long term investment and ultimately multigenerational legacy which in turn lead to concepts of regional or national identity people in the northern hemisphere venerate ancestors for what they leave behind people in the southern hemisphere tend to venerate ancestors for what they are theoretically still doing in the present day in that back stage other world where mysterious ancestral spiritual engineers pull the strings and press the levers of phenomenon in our world we dont understand the causality of pavilion architecture was not as resilient as masonry owing to the nature of organic materials buildings would have to be renovated or completely replaced every few years to a few decades height was the general strategy for the control of animal intrusion and flooding was also a common problem and so use of hanging fixtures like baskets and hammocks and raised floor systems were the norm the predominate climate worked against the use of permanent walls and temporary walls any more robust then woven reeds and textiles while masonry construction due to a scarcity of materials and the effects of water tended to be based on piled or cut stone and restricted to perimeter enclosures and terracing this kind of architecture presents a situation where there is far more rapid evolution of a communitys architecture far more frequent p2p negotiation over communal construction and far less physical individual privacy individual pavilion structures tended to increase in scale with population but just one such structure generally formed the basis of housing for an entire extended family if not the whole community at the start collective personal property tended to be limited to what one person might carry notions of property were much more fluid there were far stronger and more personal social systems of propriety to insure community cohesion taboo systems honor systems ohana and notions of cultural identity were more associated with intellectual property songs dances body art craft technique than architecture and regional territory the architecture of the southern hemisphere may have typically been less resilient than those of the northern hemisphere but their cultures were often more so australian aborigines may have the most materially light cultures of all existing people they didnt even develop any form of permanent architecture and held that system together largely unchanged for at least 40 000 years

7228906 an incomparably good book perhaps the best i have read
7228907 contrast indeed conflict of east european jews trying to recreate an idealised europe one free of anti semitism in the hot dusty climate of israel surrounded by hostile arabs
7228908 mocks his own earnest idealisation of kibbutz pioneers yet somehow affirms it as well tough warm hearted though of course silent and thoughtful young men and strapping straightforward young women i pictured these pioneers as strong serious self contained people capable of sitting around in a circle and singing songs of heart rendering longing or songs of mockery or songs of outrageous lust people who could ride wild horses or wide tracked tractors who spoke arabic who knew every cave and wadi who had a way with pistols and hand grenades yet read poetry and philosophy
7228909 if i could recommend just one book to tell you something about the human condition this would be it
7228910 all the jewish settlements that were captured by the arabs in the war of independence without exception were razed to the ground and their jewish inhabitants were murdered or taken captive or escaped but the arab armies did not allow any of the survivors to return after the war the arabs implemented a more complete ethnic cleansing in the territories they conquered than the jews did hundreds of thousands of arabs fled or were driven out from the territory of the state of israel in that war but a hundred thousand remained whereas there were no jews at all in the west bank or the gaza strip under jordanian and egyptian rule not one the settlements were obliterated and the synagogues and cemetaries were razed to the ground
7228911 as the expert propagandist that he is amos oz is well aware of how much more powerful absolute ethnic cleansing is than partial ethnic cleansing
7228912 one of the most effective propaganda tools in israeli history creating the image of the handsome dilemma ridden and existentially soul searching israeli soldier the horrific oxymoron of the purity of arms and the unfounded notion of an exalted jewish morality
7228913 voice to their messianic elation unabashed hatred of the arabs and trigger happiness
7228914 to intensify the image of the handsome morally pure soldier and to render the reasons for his dilemmas and bad conscience less specific
7228915 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7228916 we have seen some text campaigns in the many hundreds of thousands of opt in mobile users over the past couple years all in the consumer products services realm
7228917 this is the first massive effort in the political world
7228918 ein superstart mit einem sch nen tabellenbild auch wenn es nur eine momentaufnahme ist aber wir sind nicht so naiv zu glauben dass das jetzt so weiter geht erste aussagen kann man erst nach zehn spielen treffen
7228919 van bommel ist ein unbeherrschter charakter der sich nicht im griff hat und damit sich und der mannschaft keinen gefallen tut
7228920 im here for the cops and the firefighters the teachers and the line workers folks whose lives are the measure of whether the american dream endures
7228921 telling the truth is more important than making you feel good
7228922 hes so qualified so impressive too bad he cant win maybe he should be secretary of state
7228923 joes out there hugging and kissing people he just keeps going
7228924 you know the american people could care less about whats going on up here
7228925 the first mainstream african american presidential candidate who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7228926 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7228927 im a seasoned guy and i really feel completely at ease
7228928 he makes you feel like he knows you and remembers you
7228929 our position should be seriously improved in terms of benefits for the state especially for the city
7228930 hes a very nice guy and talks to everybody its a privilege for us in delaware to have joe biden for vice president
7228931 congrats sen biden thanks for putting de on the map
7228932 hes just so down to earth and im really glad he got a chance to be somebody
7228933 i think we vote our three electoral votes with pride but i dont think it decides any elections
7228934 joe is extremely effective on issues like the economy children and families and crime
7228935 his selection will prove to be a wise choice for the world our country and our wonderful state of delaware
7228936 uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7228937 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7228938 joe wont just make a good vice president he will make a great one
7228939 i say with every fiber in my being we cannot stand four more years of this
7228940 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
7228941 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7228942 if it were a race between sen mccain and sen biden it would be a very different race
7228943 biden owes his selection to russian prime minister vladimir putin
7228944 russias invasion of georgia reinforced the american worry about international tensions
7228945 vladimir putins contribution to american politics he is a necessary antidote to the obama lack of worldly wisdom which before georgia was a bit academic to most americans
7228946 took the 3 a m call obama needs a pal who can do the same
7228947 basically this is an internal american affair but it is giving us cause for concern because biden was clear in his calls to divide iraq according to sectarian and ethnic lines
7228948 an exceptionally good decision which shows how obama is trying to organize all elements of the democratic party behind him
7228949 we need a rate that allows people to legally park at the curb when they need to drop something off see the dentist go to a meeting for an hour
7228950 we believe that this is the kind of location where you should get in and out in two hours these are short term spaces
7228951 weve been brought up from conception to think cheap parking is a good idea
7228952 its part of our primitive reptilian cortex we just arent logical about parking
7228953 is there a pricing point by which transit becomes more attractive then driving between higher meters and the price of gas youre there you now have incentivized people to get out of their cars and onto transit
7228954 i think theres going to be a lot of people initially very upset by it
7228955 it sounds good in theory but in reality i think it would deter people from visiting the city
7228956 they dont want to spend a lot of money at meters meters are supposed to be cheap
7228957 we see them coming out to feed the meter all day thats not what parking meters are for theyre for you to come and park for one hour or two hours while youre shopping
7228958 if the city can free up those meters by charging more we are very much in favor of it
7228959 up until now the balance has really been autocentric and part of what were looking at is how to better accommodate transit and walking and cycling
7228960 we dont think its reasonable to expect people to carry around a roll of quarters
7228961 the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush
7228962 un pays qui laisse une poign e dobscurantistes saccager sa recherche se prive de toutes les promesses de progr s que celle ci porte pour le pr sent et pour lavenir et ce au d triment des citoyens et des consommateurs de ce pays

7228969 what this study actually proves is that search moves the branding needle for cpg
7228970 its really good news for brand marketers because there are really strong efficiencies they can find in search marketing the price for this branding value is zero because its being served anyway and marketers pay for clicks not number of impressions at this point the cost per click in these categories is very low
7228971 the implication is if youre present your awareness goes up and if youre not present your awareness goes down
7228972 it seems like from the results that the punishment for a challenger brand is very high for not being in the paid listings so they really should be there
7228973 and its also cost effective for them its probably cheaper than a tv campaign and its much easier to raise the brand perception
7228974 i think our brands have such a strong presence that its nice to be in the first position but i dont think we have to be there
7228975 im not convinced its worth paying the extra money or the extra effort to get there yet
7228976 its kind of like the klondike before the gold rush
7228977 if all branding clients go and do search for branding it will change
7228978 yes its growing and we have helped drive a lot of growth
7228979 i learn is highly motivating for students as they can immediately gain feedback on their progress the interactive cd roms are comprehensive in their coverage of the acca syllabus and fit in neatly with the bpp learning media study texts the materials are second to none and students love the variety of learning solutions we can offer

7228994 it was the first time ive been upset with obama in a long time because he woke me up
7228995 i got up and spent a lot of time on the computer and i could have spent that time sleeping
7228996 i had the phone under my pillow waiting for the text
7228997 my feeling is that they had to speed things up by a few hours once it started to leak around midnight that it was biden
7228998 they were ready to go but probably would have preferred to do it a little later
7228999 my first reaction when i read the text was what in the world is obama doing sending out a text in the middle of the night
7229000 it seems like sort of a slam to clinton i dont know what thats going to do for party unity but its pretty funny
7229001 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7229002 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and and clean and a nice looking guy
7229003 we have to find out who these names and lists were sold to and those individuals should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law
7229004 clearly they didnt want this list to send these people holiday cards they wanted this list to force people out of their homes
7229005 if they didnt have someone to sell the list to they wouldnt have a currency for this
7229006 we found 80 000 worth of stolen property along with drugs and a firearm
7229007 youre not using it to catch the guy youre using it to monitor his movements you know where hes going and where hes been
7229008 someone from the city called me thursday and said they checked with the obama campaign and they blocked the proclamation request
7229009 what unfolds at that convention matters for her and for
7229010 clinton could turn this into a positive or it could be a negative for the party

7229013 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen tables like mine you talk about how much youre worried about being able to pay the bills
7229014 hell have to figure out which of the seven tables to sit at
7229015 you cant change america when youve supported george bushs policies 95 percent of the time
7229016 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7229017 its ridiculous you buy five products and all of a sudden its a hundred bucks ive never seen anything like this before
7229018 producers have to pay more to make goods so producers will try to pass these costs forward and many times its the consumers that have to pay the difference

7229026 john has been a friend of mine for over 25 years
7229027 he only has a limited time left in his mayorship even before his term is up i think obama would look at him i mean this man is an administrator
7229028 think what a great person he would be to be secretary of commerce think what a good person hed be to be secretary of energy there are a lot of places he could do well
7229029 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is
7229030 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training

7229196 he will decorate them with the insignias of their new ranks thereafter
7229197 in view of comments and speculations in the media concerning the recent changes in the command structure of the armed forces the presidency wishes to affirm that the changes were made in the normal course of affairs and were not a reaction to any particular occurrence
7229198 the changes announced on wednesday were certainly not made in response to any perceived threat to government and the stability of the nation attempts to tie the changes to statements by some politicians should therefore be disregarded as mere mischief
7229199 the fact is that a change of guards in the armed forces had been on the cards for sometime since both the former chief of defence staff general andrew azazi and the former chief of naval staff admiral ganiyu adekeye became due for retirement several months ago

7229277 the penang state government has been mulling over the decision ever since the elections commission fixed a working day on tuesday august 26 as polling day in defiance of public opinion that this will reduce the voter turnout
7229278 by fixing polling day on a working day and giving such preferential treatment of a special school holiday the education ministry is trying to gain an advantage for a certain party and their candidate
7229279 to ensure a level playing field and fairness to all candidates the penang state government has decided to declare august 26 2008 as a state public holiday

7229424 thus both the physical form and the institutional life of the city from the very beginning of the urban implosion were shaped in no small measure by the irrational and magical purposes of war from this source sprang the elaborate system of fortifications with walls ramparts towers canals ditches that continued to characterize the chief historic cities apart from certain special cases as during the pax romana down to the eighteenth century the physical structure of the city in turn perpetuated the animus the isolation and self assertion that favoured the new institution
7229425 throughout the greater part of history enslavement forced labour and destruction have accompanied and penalized the growth of urban civilization
7229426 currently we market our products in india through three dealers one each in delhi mumbai and chandigarh now we are planning to expand our business in places like hyderabad bangalore pune and cochin we will disclose our business details within the next two weeks

7229444 the protocol has been watered down and we are not entirely happy by that but there are 23 concrete targets set down that each country must work towards it is one of the most concrete and explicit documents on gender equality in the region and it will be a challenging target to all governments
7229445 it will have the same net effect which is to set the stage for women being denied access to health care women being denied information and women even being denied referrals

7229448 the discussion of a range of issues of international importance
7229449 sen hillary clinton was our first choice and that of 18 million primary voters but presumptive democratic nominee sen barack obamas pick joe biden is a friend of women and a strong selection for vice president
7229450 that last 18 percent will move over when they see hillary and bill clinton at the convention campaigning for obama and on the stump for obama
7229451 is it sort of an ill show you or is it much more on the issues
7229452 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance responsibility lies with us all
7229453 women really cant be and shouldnt be taken for granted
7229454 this is really just one measure of health care quality
7229455 certainly everyones care needs to be tailored to their own personal needs
7229456 that transparency sort of gives some added urgency for all hospitals to continue to focus on quality
7229457 the events of the past two weeks have been a disaster for us foreign policy
7229458 russias invasion of its neighbour is a clear demonstration that the us led effort to integrate postsoviet russia into the west has failed
7229459 a cold war mentality will strengthen on both sides the georgians hope to integrate quickly with europe and nato has been at best set far back
7229460 we are de facto in an escalation game with the russians that they appear to be winning
7229461 has shown little interest in foreign affairs and has made no significant contribution regarding the crisis in georgia
7229462 we dont even bother to hope anymore that somebody will come to protect us
7229463 they dont come out and say they want us off the land but they are forcing us off
7229464 they put a kalashnikov to my chest and said do you have money gold or a car
7229465 i started crying and one of them said dont worry we wont do anything wrong to you
7229466 the militias are still coming theyre still driving through and robbing us
7229467 when cars come through were just hiding there is nobody to protect us and were very scared
7229468 the soldiers dont say anything to us they only enter in houses and ask for food and drink
7229469 who has anything to give them but what they can find they take
7229470 they were entering into yards and making inquiries and if they found them they shot them
7229471 it was horrible of course but i told myself i had to do it
7229472 vous en avez de la chance vous tiez fin pr te pour aller au travail ainsi
7229473 im sure he was overwhelmed by everything not only what happened on the volleyball court
7229474 its just something he poured his heart and soul into for the last four years
7229475 but certainly with the tragedy that befell his family at the beginning of these games im so happy he was able to be here and experience this with us
7229476 because hes a huge if not the biggest part of our team
7229477 it is clear that china has put the bar very high
7229478 its going to be a challenge for london and also for all subsequent games i believe and my hope will be that london will put the bar higher
7229479 there are issues that london will not be able to copy or equal
7229480 the ability to bring in hundreds of thousands of volunteers to different sites not only in beijing but also qingdao where the sailing events were staged hong kong equestrian and other cities is something that numbers wise is not going to be easy for london
7229481 i believe london has unique assets if you look at the games each games have special identities
7229482 athens in 2004 was a return to the roots the country that has invented the
7229483 london will be the city of the country that has invented modern sports the country that has invented the rules of sport and brought in the values of fair play that is the identity that has to be used in london
7229484 london is also a very cosmopolitan city multi ethnic multi cultural multi religious this is also an asset
7229485 the rest i have absolutely no concern the venues will be first class
7229486 sure it is about sport but we will also take the chance to showcase the creative capital that london is buying a laptop
7229487 in terms of fuel savings only p42 84 million is saved every year since 2005 on normal u turn slots on non widened roads while p51 45 million is saved on u turn slots on widened roads
7229488 in terms of total savings to motorists or the savings in take home pay and opportunity and productivity it was revealed that up to p2 33 billion is saved every year since 2005
7229489 what they dont know is that the u turn slot has operational efficiency in time and space
7229490 at a u turn slot the flow of vehicles is non stop and non gap
7229491 this is felt even more when traveling at night in which the flow of traffic at the u turn slot is continuous unlike some corners where motorists need to stop at the red light
7229492 the u turn or modified rotunda scheme is one of our solutions in areas with traffic gridlock problems like c 5 kalayaan

7229500 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver
7229501 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7229502 ive been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swift boat politics that he once so deplored
7229503 folks campaigns for presidents are a test of character and leadership

7229519 we heard allegations in the media about the ages and we took that very seriously and we asked the international federation to organise an inquiry themselves
7229520 the eligibility of the athletes is the responsibility of the federation not the ioc but we considered it to be a very serious issue
7229521 the international federation requested all documents like family books and entries of schools and things like that and these have been received
7229522 at first sight everything seems okay however the fig wants to study them thoroughly because they are in chinese and then they will report to the ioc as soon as possible
7229523 i want to solemly state here that the age of all these athletes that have been questioned conforms with olympic rules for these events
7229524 last year at the cities games he was transferred from one competing delegation to another and in the process of registration there was some discrepancies in the age of athletes
7229525 therefore that mistake led to a series of other misunderstandings afterwards
7229526 i dont want to talk about this subject any more because those who know me they know that im 16
7229527 how can i do more explain more no matter what people say im still 16
7229528 it sure hasnt sunk in yet this was such a hard fought battle

7229554 i want to express once more that im a bit angry at whats been said about me
7229555 to say that i didnt want to join the argentine selection was a big lie its not what i said and nor is it what id ever say because i always love to represent my country

7229560 avem un lot unit si nu ne temem de niciun adversar din liga i este adevarat ca nu am batut o pe cfr cluj pana acum dar cred ca a venit momentul sa castigam si in fata lor clujul a ramas aceeasi echipa puternica ar fi gresit din partea noastra sa credem ca cfr este o prada usoara pentru noi este adevarat ca au pierdut cinci puncte in ultimele doua meciuri dar de aceea sunt convins ca vor face tot posibilul sa castige la vaslui sper sa si revina dupa meciul cu noi
7229561 kone a fost transferat in aceasta vara de cfr cluj de la rosenborg insa nu a putut juca din cauza unei accidentari doua sau trei schimbari sigur vor fi aia e clar astazi a facut primul antrenament cu echipa si kone cu pregatirea fizica e pus la punct a facut doar 16 zile de pauza n are nici o problema sa joace 60 de minute sa vedem daca se integreaza unde ii e locul cel mai bun sistemul care l avantajeaza totul e sa fie sanatos de jucat probabil va juca la vaslui cat cum asta urmeaza sa vedem

7229570 trebuie sa ne imbunatatim apararea este clar am primit cinci goluri in deplasare sapte goluri in total e normal ca trebuie sa ne imbunatatim foarte mult si nu neaparat apararea ci sistemul pentru ca eu cred ca totul incepe de la mijlocasi imi doresc un fundas acolo sunt probleme dar nu depinde de mine sunt mai multi factori depinde si de jucatorul respectiv daca vrea sa vina

7229594 luvdarts are much more than just a mobile video download to the consumer they are digital greeting cards they can send to their family friends and lovers but to a business they are valuable tools in harnessing the power of word of mouth peer2peer advertising
7229595 well its a well known fact that the most effective marketing comes from personal recommendations by family and friends and there have never been greater opportunities for a business to market directly to consumers than the mobile space presents today the problem is how to get directly to the consumer without violating their privacy and rules set forth to protect the consumer by the wireless industry luvdarts get people to spread the word family to family friend to friend lover to lover and we let the businesses subsidize the activity
7229596 its simple we let a business run a campaign whenever they want to drive more traffic to their physical location or website s they can choose the start and end dates their target market daily download budget and incentives we then stock their luvdart downloading store with co branded luvdarts they distribute a code to their customers who can visit that store and download luvdarts free under the terms of that campaign
7229597 oh i get it the business pays for the download later at a wholesale price
7229598 thats right the business only pays for whats been downloaded to be clear there is a setup charge for each campaign
7229599 hmmm very interesting concept i see where people will want to send luvdarts to their family and friends as they also carry a businesses message and promotions without violating their privacy how are you going to get this going with businesses
7229600 thats a great question first we think any business that advertises in the yellow pages will be interested in a luvdarts campaign why the average business is paying a monthly amount for an ad they cant change for 12 months in the yellow pages we give them the ability to run a campaign of different sizes and targets whenever they please for local businesses as well as national that is huge the traffic that will come from a campaign is generated mainly from their existing patrons word of mouth and the business is able to control the times when it may need more traffic driven to its location
7229601 well it seems like youve got a winner here i will be watching your progress

7229603 the scrapbook industry has changed rapidly in the last five years
7229604 digital scrapbooking and photo books have become very popular ways to preserve your memories the majority of scrapbookers have digital cameras and for some of them it makes more sense to print a photo book rather than individual photos retailers in the traditional scrapbook industry have struggled to figure out how to capitalize on this trend the photobookbiz program is that answer to that question

7229633 he likes our game he likes the team in this game only this
7229634 we were talking about the portsmouth game nothing more than that
7229635 some players said to me it was a very good pitch but if not we need to change we need to play some high balls
7229636 but we need to play and we need to think about this i dont have players for long ball because deco is short ashley cole is not tall we need to try
7229637 wigan is near manchester its five hours by car from cobham
7229638 its in the north of england and more important than this its a good team strong team good physically and they play well
7229639 i know the players heskey amr zaki and olivier kapo luis antonio valencia and wilson palacios because they are south americans
7229640 heskey is difficult for a stopper to mark because he uses his body he jumps very well and hes smart
7229641 ive said before we suffered on the counter attack when other teams play a 9 1 formation if you score a goal it changes completely
7229642 i noted a lot of things against czech republic the good things and the bad things it is important for me because the four games we played before the level of teams were not like this
7229643 against czech republic i understood where we have to improve
7229644 at this moment there is a difference physically from the czechs and england players they were faster with more pressing and we suffered from this
7229645 they need to find a good condition it is impossible at the moment to be 100 per cent before the game i decided wayne rooney and lampard would only play one hour i saw on tv rooney and gerrard but i did not see them myself last weekend
7229646 i was told both were so so and not in perfect condition for me these players are an important part of the team and i want to see them on the pitch
7229647 i think against czech republic i saw a good spirit not like croatia i think they are like turkey and have a big spirit of the country
7229648 but i am happy because the reaction of the players during the czech game was positive

7229677 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7229678 we havent given him the best run support but every game we feel like we have a great chance to win when he pitches and again he pitched great today
7229679 hes been the type of guy that has been plugging away
7229680 unfortunately he hasnt had the best couple of weeks but hes been a player in there working hard every single day so for him to come up with the big hit in the first inning definitely got us out in front and i think that was huge
7229681 hes pitched some good ballgames where he got some losses and hes pitched some real close ones where he didnt get any decisions
7229682 thats my mind set to really focus on preventing runs instead of watching how many runs we have
7229683 were capable of scoring definitely more than three runs a night
7229684 when were clicking were going to average about five runs a game when were really good once we get consistent and start scoring runs like we can and our pitching stays as good as its been were going to win quite a few games
7229685 were putting a lot of pressure on our pitchers because were not scoring runs
7229686 ive had about 15 careers to my way of thinking retiring is not the end of a career its just the opportunity to start another career
7229687 the conventional view of retirement working full time until a set date then shifting to full time leisure does not match the experience of many older americans

7229699 every generation there are changes in peoples relationship with government
7229700 government should do more especially when youre spending tens of billions of dollars in iraq protecting the interests of millionaires
7229701 weve got to revoke the tax cuts for the wealthy
7229702 we definitely need to do something more for the economically disadvantaged weve allowed big corporations to take millions for corporate leaders while workers get nothing
7229703 during the era when bill clinton was president there was a clear re centering of the party
7229704 there is a growing understanding that government can play a positive role in investing in our country
7229705 enormous dissatisfaction with the republican party has brought out the base more
7229706 the rise of the internet and bloggers has made the party more progressive
7229707 by 1980 the average person said i dont need government anymore
7229708 the whole world changes and people feel a little bit at sea and they need help
7229709 wir waren auf das schlimmste gefasst nun sind wir alle erleichtert
7229710 the term euthanasia is derived from the greek terms eu meaning good and thanatos meaning death
7229711 conditions found in the field although more challenging than those that are controlled do not in any way reduce or minimize the ethical obligation of the responsible individual to reduce pain and distress to the greatest extent possible during the taking of the animals life handling these animals often requires general anesthesia which provides loss of consciousness and which relieves distress anxiety apprehension and perception of pain
7229712 the event involves many including the local administration the becak drivers association local media and the regencys traffic police
7229713 this is a quite significant progress the people and the residents have understood the risks sexual diseases numbers would surely decline
7229714 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche

7229718 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7229719 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7229720 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables

7229724 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7229725 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7229726 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7229727 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7229728 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7229729 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7229730 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7229731 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7229732 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7229733 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre

7229736 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7229737 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7229738 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7229739 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7229740 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

7229757 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7229758 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano

7229793 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
7229794 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
7229795 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
7229796 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
7229797 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
7229798 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
7229799 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
7229800 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
7229801 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
7229802 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
7229803 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
7229804 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
7229805 recherche de quelquun pour coordonner la r ponse ce pitch norme quelquun qui prendrait le projet bras le corps
7229806 je sais faire je peux faire et si oui combien
7229807 praying to whom it may concern and having to refer questions to the appropriate committee for discussion
7229808 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7229809 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7229810 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7229811 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7229812 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7229813 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7229814 auf diesem parteitag soll zwar sein nachfolger nominiert werden dies aber ist vor allem der tag des harald ringstorff
7229815 mv 2020 modern und sozial gerecht so k nnte der arbeitstitel lauten
7229816 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7229817 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7229818 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7229819 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7229820 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7229821 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7229822 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7229823 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7229824 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7229825 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7229826 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7229827 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7229828 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7229829 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7229830 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7229831 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7229832 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7229833 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7229834 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7229835 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7229836 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7229837 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7229838 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7229839 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7229840 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7229841 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7229842 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7229843 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7229844 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7229845 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7229846 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7229847 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7229848 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7229849 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7229850 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7229851 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7229852 i havent told anyone yet doctor not even my wife
7229853 well its like this doctor your new hearing aid has worked wonders like you said
7229854 but when we have company i prefer to sit and just listen to those speaking around me and ive changed my will five times already
7229855 sony ericsson wanted to make sure our first hsdpa handset was the perfect combination of style and function as all know hsdpa is a big leap forward in the speed of mobile functionality but as always sony ericsson does not deliver technology for its own sake
7229856 we believe the z750 is such a compelling offer because not only will it be one of the best looking clamshells on the market but it also provides the tools or applications which really let you get the most from these broadband speeds
7229857 sony ericsson is continuing to deliver on the promise of the marriage of sony and ericsson with iconic products such as the z750 says najmi jarwala president sony ericsson mobile communications usa inc there is no question that hsdpa is critical for north american gsm operators and we believe products like the z750 will entice the mass market to tap into everything these faster networks enable consumers to do while on the move
7229858 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7229859 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7229860 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7229861 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7229862 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7229863 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7229864 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7229865 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7229866 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7229867 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7229868 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7229869 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7229870 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7229871 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7229872 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7229873 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7229874 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7229875 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7229876 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7229877 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7229878 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7229879 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7229880 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7229881 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7229882 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7229883 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7229884 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7229885 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7229886 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7229887 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7229888 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7229889 we are making use of these devices to save valuable satellite phone time and cost
7229890 these in combination with the radios and associated recent fixes to coastal coverage are providing reliable communications with our field staff
7229891 der prinzipien der wahrheit sind sieben derjenige der sie kennt und versteht besitzt den meister schl ssel durch dessen ber hrung alle tore des tempels sich ffnen
7229892 i would like to continue jumping another couple years but i dont know if i could go another four because the way my body feels
7229893 mostly just because of the stress and the pressure that ive been dealing with over the past 24 hours
7229894 i had a bit of trouble shifting on the last climb and irina was right on my wheel i had to put a foot down she got by me and that was bronze
7229895 i got in a little trouble in the corner i was stuck inside and could not get out at the end of the day i have to be happy with the finish and the 10 year process to get here
7229896 our team has worked so hard preparing for these games and to get this result here tells us that were finally there being one step up in ranking and beating the americans proves to us that our country has greatly improved
7229897 its like sitting on your back porch and driving your house
7229898 their projected rates of expansion are so fast that we dont have a hope in hell of reducing greenhouse gas emissions
7229899 it would be the equivalent of several hundred exxon valdez oil spills
7229900 we did okay to a certain extent against villa but we need to be a bit more resolute
7229901 we have to make sure the pattern of play and the way we approach games is correct not just for 45 minutes or 60 minutes but for 90 minutes
7229902 that is what we are striving to achieve it is early days though and these things can take time
7229903 we worked extremely hard in pre season and are looking for a positive result from our first league game at home
7229904 mark knows what he is doing and he has been very successful i do not see that changing
7229905 once he gets bedded in at manchester city they will be a decent side
7229906 last season they finished in the top half and then came under pressure from injuries near the end so i am expecting them to do okay this year
7229907 obviously wed be excited regardless but with a game like this we know where our focus is from day to day
7229908 im about 80 percent right now i dont think ill get to a full 100 percent but ill definitely be able to push 245 pound defensive ends off the line
7229909 in this computer age we live in everybody sees what everybody says
7229910 we feel like kevin has the ability to make plays
7229911 we feel great about nates experience and knowledge and his play making ability as well we want to see with the roles reversed how that works were looking for the best chance to be successful its so close its going to be continual evaluation
7229912 we just have to do the little things to get over the hump and win those close games

7229914 i think that weve proven that theres no rust i dont think we need more reps
7229915 when we get protection those receivers are not going to lose very often i think weve proven that over the past couple years
7229916 we just have to stay in manageable situations in the game that keep our offensive line in successful situations in terms of pass blocking thats where weve gotten ourselves in trouble
7229917 but i mean weve thrown for a lot of yards the last couple years and a high percentage i dont think this is anything new really
7229918 it was a panic thing because me and the receiver werent on the same page
7229919 it was just the cardinal sin dont throw it right over the middle
7229920 i think the best thing that happened to him tonight was he had the turnover and he had to bounce back from that
7229921 he did a great job managing the game and played really well i thought
7229922 i think i played well today and hopefully i can make the team
7229923 i think were solid nobodys really jumped out so if youre solid no penalties
7229924 we had to manufacture a two minute drill to make sure we got it in
7229925 hes got a live arm he just needs to in my opinion command strike one hes got too many walks for his innings
7229926 once he gets command of his fastball then hes going to be something special
7229927 all he needs to do in this league is basically throw it down the middle and he gets guys out
7229928 this is the first time ive been away from them in 19 years
7229929 scolaris been at the top of the tree and you have nothing but admiration for people who get there
7229930 hes been the national coach of brazil and won the world cup and this is what the premier league is all about we seem to have the best coaches and the best players now which is fantastic
7229931 it was close last year and im sure theyll be neck and neck again which way itll go will be like a toss of a coin but i believe man united are the team to beat after what they did last year
7229932 if the club sells one or two more players its not a problem for me
7229933 i dont know if some clubs want shaun wright phillips in the last game he played 25 30 minutes and he has played for the second time in the first group of training i dont know what the player is thinking about with regards offers from other teams
7229934 if i have 24 25 players with me and three or four for every two positions then im happy i have three or four players in this wing right and wing left position
7229935 the scores the score and i still get a medal
7229936 the whole games have been great and a silver is still brilliant
7229937 over the past two weeks i dont think anyones appreciated how hard its been shoulder slaps get scored all i could do was get in there and box
7229938 and now israel what does god ask from you other than to fear him
7229939 well all that god really wants is that you fear him
7229940 he will be praised and beloved and others will desire to emulate him this person has sanctified the almighty
7229941 tell everyone to get on and let those in the back pass up their money or cartisiot
7229942 i set before you a blessing and a curse the blessing if you obey the commandments of god the curse if you do not and you follow other gods
7229943 you will slaughter animals according to the manner i god have prescribed
7229944 you are a nation consecrated to god your lord god has chosen you from all nations on the face of the earth to be his own special nation deut 14 1 2
7229945 see i am placing before you this day a blessing and a curse the blessing if you will listen to the commandments of the almighty which i am commanding you this day and the curse if you do not listen to the almightys commandments
7229946 he is speaking to everyone else here i dont have to take what he says seriously since he is not really directing his words to me
7229947 i feel that i am a good man even though i dont do all of the mitzvot commandments in the torah
7229948 what is the checklist to know whether one is actually good
7229949 what does feeling that i am good have to do with whether or not one is actually a good person
7229950 see i have set before you this day life and good death and evil
7229951 the wicked even in their own lives are considered dead
7229952 do not say because of my virtue that god brought me to occupy this land
7229953 man does not live by bread alone but by all that comes out of gods mouth
7229954 only that you remain in awe of god your lord so that you will follow all his paths and love him serving god your lord with all your heart and with all your soul you must keep gods commandments and decrees so that all good will be yours
7229955 and it shall be if you hearken to my commandments which i command you this day
7229956 jeff shouldnt we stay out of this part of the lake and stick to where the counselors can see us
7229957 aw dont be such a worry wart anyway what could possibly
7229958 were gonna capsize were gonna capsize where are the life jackets
7229959 i guess i kinda um lost my cool out there but you were the man how did you ever pull that off
7229960 you know jeff im not really sure i just wasnt that scared could be cuz when i was younger i had pretty bad asthma and couldnt do a lot of stuff one of the games i used to play to keep myself occupied was called what would you do if i used to make up really scary dangerous situations and id have to figure out how to get out of them this was nothing compared to being charged by a pack of elephants in a rainstorm
7229961 dont waste time writing stories or poems they will never bring you anything
7229962 following a course inspection by turf club officials at tralee earlier today the course was found to be waterlogged following heavy rain on saturday afternoon and overnight
7229963 when i was a coach in brazil they always said i was a coach for europe because of my style
7229964 my teams were very organized and the style more stronger and physical
7229965 so it has not been difficult for me to put my stamp on the club and players
7229966 chelsea played very well but they just didnt win one game so for me it is not a bad season they got to the carling cup final but they lost to spurs
7229967 they finished second in the league to manchester united and lost by just two points on the last day and they also lost the final of the champions league
7229968 das olympische dorf war gro artig die wettkampfst tten erstklassig die organisation makellos
7229969 aber wir k nnen durch den sport zu positiven ver nderungen beitragen und tun dies auch
7229970 wir fanden es ungew hnlich dass keiner dieser proteste stattfand
7229971 ich glaube das internationale olympische komitee hat sehr viel an glaubw rdigkeit eingeb t und es h tte sehr viel mehr auch konsequent fordernd auftreten k nnen und auftreten m ssen
7229972 es waren gro e sch ne olympische sportspiele aber eine fassade was die verdeckung von unterdr ckung von demokratischen rechten angeht

7229981 the way we have been treated these past 10 days has demolished our authority in the eyes of the people suddenly they think nothing of us
7229982 on the eve of the separatists rally to pampore last week we got strict instruction mid afternoon not to allow a single person out of the district
7229983 then late evening came yet more instructions facilitate the pampore rally dont give the impression the administration is against it stay calm even in the face of provocation
7229984 then suddenly we were not doing that these elements who we have to engage with and control on a daily basis were shot with a huge rush of victory
7229985 the separatists have been given booster doses of victory by our bosses we have been projected as powerless whatever the thinking behind it this is terrible strategy i would say suicidal
7229986 the erosion of our authority has been so swift the boys in downtown srinagar are bold enough today to demand the removal of security bunkers
7229987 there has been the odd case where they have go ahead and demolished them and nobody has resisted we are being pushed with our hands tied to our backs

7229993 das ist eine idee die ganz bewusst offengehalten wurde und keinen ausschlie en soll
7229994 wir haben defizite und die haben wir acht jahre bert ncht
7229995 wir haben viele fahrer die etwas mehr auf den rippen haben
7229996 denen kann und will ich nat rlich nicht vorschreiben was sie in der pause essen sollen aber wenn sie sich darauf einlassen tun sie nicht nur etwas f r ihre gesundheit sondern auch f r ihren arbeitsplatz
7229997 das einzige was uns jetzt noch hilft sind preiserh hungen
7229998 in manchen monaten kommt man mit seinem gehalt ziemlich nah an hartz iv
7229999 das ist eigentlich kein job mehr zum berleben wenn es nicht soviel spa machen w rde h tte ich l ngst aufgegeben
