8060005 if you like what youre reading click an ad to say thanks
8060006 i can say this because there are no ads here
8060007 i never click on ads its almost a badge of honor to say that
8060008 well actually i have bought magazine subscriptions and clothing and sex aids
8060009 my point was that if everyone started clicking clickthrough rates would go up for a while thered be an imbalance and sites would make too much and advertisers would pay too much but then advertisers would use the landing pages to start converting
8060010 if anyone wants to come with me he must deny himself take up his cross daily and follow me
8060011 if anyone wants to come with me jesus he must check his schedule and with everyone else to see what they are doing that day take up his cross if it is convenient and follow me
8060012 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8060013 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8060014 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8060015 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8060016 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8060017 the chancellor must either press ahead with the legislation immediately or confirm that it will not happen so would be buyers move ahead with their purchase
8060018 the temporary suspension of the tax would provide some much needed relief
8060019 first time buyers will be able to put the money they save towards increasing their deposit enabling them to access the tightly restricted mortgage market more easily but its essential that the government acts before the market grinds to a halt
8060020 the dithering about stamp duty is exacerbating the problems facing the market
8060021 obvious solutions such as scrapping the tax for first time buyers or adjusting its thresholds are staring the government in the face but then it wouldnt get the large amount of tax it has been enjoying
8060022 darlings dithering has made the situation worse and now many people are putting their lives on hold as a result of labours economic incompetence
8060023 i want everything that happened that day to be laid bare in a full public inquiry
8060024 i hold a massive grudge against scottish coal and want something done to stop other families suffering the way we have
8060025 that should have alerted the company of the need to put in place systems designed to reduce the risks of similar accidents occurring again they failed to do so and that failure is in my view of considerable magnitude
8060026 it is crucial additional steps are taken to ensure drivers of these dump trucks are aware of other smaller vehicles around them
8060027 there is an increase reported for 2007 versus 2006 but we need to look at the broader picture which shows a decline
8060028 i am particularly shocked to see nhs highland which has one of the highest suicide rates in the uk is cutting its funding to choose life by a third over the next three years
8060029 labour achieved a steady reduction in suicides between 2001 and 2007 this progress has now been reversed and is jeopardised by snp cuts
8060030 the 13 per cent drop in suicide rates since 2002 is an encouraging sign but despite the lowest reported levels of suicides in nearly 15 years being recorded in 2005 and 2006 the number of people who completed suicide in scotland increased in 2007
8060031 to say i was embarrassed for the full eight minutes is an understatement
8060032 our ceremony was tacky i wish i could turn back time and id put on a much better show myself

8060041 at the end of our third conversation she said ill see you friday in lab

8060045 my human got it for me the first time we went hunting he stopped in a bar down the street climbed up on a tall stool handed me a credit card pointed to the market down the street and said fetch ever since we have never gone home without two ducks
8060046 many of the public campaigns on the dangers of binge drinking focus on physical injuries or even looking ridiculous to their friends
8060047 binge drinking can lead to dementia at a relatively early age
8060048 while young people tend not to take on board the dangers of health problems which might not affect them until they are 40 or 50 this is a message they need to hear
8060049 the image of someone aged 40 who is otherwise quite fit but ends up in a care home because they are unable to look after themselves is quite shocking

8060073 you your joys and your sorrows your memories and your ambitions your sense of personal identity and free will are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules who you are is nothing but a pack of neurons
8060074 although we appear to have free will in fact our choices have already been predetermined for us and we cannot change that
8060075 omg if im just a pack of neurons i have much bigger things to worry about than behaving on this experiment
8060076 this governments going into opposition in my view you cant carry on with policies which are really yesterdays policies
8060077 weve got a situation where weve got a prime minister thats never been less popular than today
8060078 the unions concern about the political direction of the government as well as the industrial concerns over continued calls for pay restraint in the public and private sectors while inflation busts through the governments targets have been put directly to gordon brown

8060082 he made a comment in the past i cant honestly tell you how long ago in the past that he didnt believe a black should be the leader of this country
8060083 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
8060084 it could turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads
8060085 it is the first attempt in europe since nazi germany and stalin of a big country to annex the territory of another country
8060086 not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8060087 this is not an easy choice but this is the only chance to save peoples lives
8060088 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8060089 we fully support georgias independence and territorial integrity which cannot be changed by decree from moscow
8060090 it will also not work it is contrary to the principles of the peace agreement which russia recently agreed and to recent russian statements
8060091 it takes no account of the views of the hundreds of thousands of georgians and others who have been forced to abandon their homes in the two territories
8060092 this is contrary to the obligations russia has repeatedly taken on in un security council resolutions
8060093 it does nothing to improve the prospects of peace in the caucasus
8060094 this is why it is essential we develop a coherent strategy to deal with population growth we not only need to ensure that our population grows at a more sustainable rate but that we also prepare properly for that sustainable rate of growth
8060095 this is yet another warning that if we do not get a hold of immigration the population of this small island will become unmanageable
8060096 projections such as these are proof that we are right to be carrying out the biggest shake up to the immigration system for a generation
8060097 i will not leave the government house until there is political change
8060098 i assigned pol gen kowit to oversee the national police office and the interior ministry
8060099 police will use all means to restore normalcy as soon as possible police will take decisive action against the protesters
8060100 i do not want the government to be branded as those using their power to suppress the protesters
8060101 i will not resign i will stay to protect this country
8060102 the military will not stage a coup detat the public must not panic and must carry on their daily lives the army will not get involved in politics
8060103 todays protest is an extraordinary one we will do everything possible to make sure the state mechanisms stop working but we will not do anything to cause trouble to the people
8060104 in my lifetime i would have to say that things do seem to be getting worse and they seem to be getting worse because sorry to say it people get stupider and stupider every election cycle id love anybody to tell me something that you cant just tell the american people and have them believe it because you didnt add lol to it at end of your email message they think offshore drilling is going to lower the price of gas and they think obama the black guy from a single mother somehow is the elitist so i think the american people at the end of the day have to look in the mirror they get the leaders they deserve and they dont deserve very good leaders
8060105 every one of us could stand up and recite all the reasons why we must elect barack the supreme court is at stake our educational system needs the right kind of change weve got to become energy independent we have to create millions of new green collar jobs weve got so much work to do around the world none of that will happen if john mccain is in the white house i just want to make it absolutely clear we cannot afford four more years of george w bushs failed policies in america and thats what we would get with john mccain now i understand that the mccain campaign is running ads trying to divide us and let me state what i think about their tactics and these ads i am hillary clinton and i do not approve that message

8060118 that showed when you present 30 flavors of jam at a gourmet food store you get more interest but less purchasing than when you only show six flavors of jam all of a sudden it became an issue or at least a possibility that adding options could actually decrease the likelihood that people would actually choose any of them more and more because of that study people have actually tried to study it in the wild in the field by getting companies to vary the variety that they offer and tracking both purchasing and also satisfaction so that s starting to happen but there are not very many papers that are actually published on that this whole line of work is only about five years old

8060121 as a republican i stand before you with deep respect for the history and traditions of my political party but it is clear to all americans that something is out of kilter in our great republic seldom has the case for an inspiring new political ethic been more compelling and seldom has an emerging leader so matched the needs of the moment i stand before you proud of my partys contributions to american history but as a citizen proud as well of the good judgment of good people in this good party in nominating a transcending candidate an individual whom i am convinced will recapture the american dream and be a truly great president the senator from abraham lincolns state barack obama this is not a time for politics as usual obama will recapture the american dream and be a truly great president

8060149 when a republican wears a little american flag lapel pin what is he trying to say
8060150 why did the vietnamese shoot down john mccain and put him in prison for five years he seems like such a nice guy
8060151 mccains sacrifice had nothing to do with protecting the united states he was sent to vietnam along with hundreds of thousands of others in an attempt to prop up what was essentially an american colony south vietnam which was being run by a dictator whom we installed
8060152 that had we taken the war to the north and made full consistent use of air power in the north we ultimately would have prevailed
8060153 is it morally right to drop bombs and missiles in a heavily populated area where hundreds if not thousands of civilians will perish

8060199 gold remains hesitant and is not getting clear direction from the dollar which is essentially flat
8060200 higher oil prices and weakness in equity markets should result in gold remaining well bid as this market session progresses but given the degree of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty anything can happen in these markets in the short term
8060201 having less and less effect at the moment as we run out of time before the high season in gold begins in the last quarter
8060202 the bottom line is that this lack of supply and huge demand will result in materially higher prices in the coming weeks
8060203 unprecedented and phenomenal level of shorting in recent weeks and this shorting was heavily concentrated amongst just a handful of players
8060204 the market place is presently divided into two parts the jewelers who have a little time to buy before they need to together with investment demand which waits for the price to be ready to rise before they go in
8060205 the other side are the short term traders on comex who take opportunities on both the up and down side of the market
8060206 last week saw them sell until they hit support below 800 then vigorous demand take the gold price back up over 800
8060207 right now they are deciding whether to knock the price down again or have they hit too large a support
8060208 as to international news affecting the gold price i personally only see news relevant to the monetary system and directly to gold buying or selling as being of importance
8060209 georgia and such troubles like iraq dont make people buy gold
8060210 it is becoming clearer that the problems of the monetary system where they affect the future value of the dollar are worsening but are also affecting other currencies
8060211 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment
8060212 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8060213 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8060214 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner
8060215 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8060216 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8060217 in this day and age where all these ballparks are being built now where people can reach out over the outfield fence and catch balls fan interference is becoming more and more of an issue
8060218 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8060219 it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times
8060220 thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8060221 i find it very strange that with 30 games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8060222 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time
8060223 some people thought that we ought to wait until the postseason
8060224 id rather go into the postseason knowing that weve already used it
8060225 so if the game is held up for a couple of minutes a couple of times a year i think thats ok
8060226 its certainly not going to be seen as often as it is in the nfl
8060227 i believe that because of the configuration of ballparks both new and old that calling home runs is really much more difficult than it once was
8060228 i dont believe in the use of instant replay for other things
8060229 i just dont want it to open up pandoras box with calls at home and calls at the bases and eventually behind the plate
8060230 we havent talked about that i think that thats unlikely over the term of this agreement
8060231 what well obviously do is look at it after the world series were hopeful that were going to say it was great

8060260 shame on you barack obama enough with the speeches and the big rallies and then using tactics that are right out of karl roves playbook
8060261 senator obama holds up his original opposition to the war on the campaign trail but he didnt start working aggressively to end the war until he started running for president so when he had a chance to act on his speech he chose silence instead
8060262 last summer he basically threatened to bomb pakistan which i dont think was a particularly wise position to take
8060263 so you decide which makes more sense entrust our country to someone who is ready on day one or to put america in the hands of someone with little national or international experience who started running for president the day he arrived in the u s senate
8060264 well you know senator obama it is very difficult having a straight up debate with you because you never take responsibility for any vote and that has been a pattern
8060265 if we dont have universal health care we will be betraying the democratic partys principles sen obamas plan does not and cannot cover all americans
8060266 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8060267 now i could stand up here and say lets just get everybody together lets get unified the skies will open the light will come down celestial choirs will be singing and everyone will know we should do the right thing and the world will be perfect

8060338 we reasonably worship jesus christ having learned that he is the son of the true god himself and holding him in the second place and the prophetic spirit in the third there is another god and lord subject to the maker of all things who is also called an angel because he announces to men whatsoever the maker of all things above whom there is no other god wishes to announce to them he who is said to have appeared to abraham and to jacob and to moses and who is called god is distinct from him who made all things numerically i mean not distinct in will
8060339 god was in the beginning but the beginning is the power of the logos with him by logos power the logos himself also who was in him subsists and by his simple will the logos springs forth and the logos not coming forth in vain becomes the first begotten work of the father the logos begotten in the beginning begat in turn our world
8060340 christians desire this one thing alone that they know god and his logos what is the oneness of the son with the father what is the communion of the father with the son what is the spirit what is the unity of these three the spirit the son father and their distinction in unity
8060341 in one god the father almighty maker of heaven and earth and in one christ jesus the son of god who became incarnate for our salvation and in the holy spirit
8060342 how comes it to pass that god should be thought to suffer division and severance in the son and in the holy ghost who have the second and the third places assigned to them and who are so closely joined with the father in his substance
8060343 the father is the entire substance but the son is a derivation and portion of the whole the father is greater than the son

8060382 it was a remarkable victory one to be enjoyed because we are always on the receiving end of thrashings like that in the four or five years i have played one day internationals we have never hammered a team as convincingly as that before
8060383 it is brilliant the way the guys have turned things around since vaughanie and colly resigned i think i am very fortunate to have four guys bowling together at 90mph they fill the fielders with so much happiness i am sure that if previous captains had had them firing on all cylinders at the start of their campaigns im sure theyd have been all right

8060394 vede e insolito per la nostra compagnia permettere a una persona con biglietto di classe economica di sedersi in prima classe ma viste le circostanze il comandante pensa che sarebbe scandaloso obbligare qualcuno a sedersi a fianco di una persona sgradevole
8060395 quindi signore se lo desidera prenda il suo bagaglio a mano che un posto in prima classe la attende

8060407 the obama plan is going to bring energy independence to america if we can do it pennsylvania then we can do it in every state in the union
8060408 with millions of americans feeling health care stretching out of their reach we cannot afford four years of john mccain
8060409 for eight years weve had a president more concerned with the health of insurance companies than the health of the american people
8060410 lets let all of americas workers know they are in the house tonight
8060411 after eight years of failed economic policies policies mccain has promised to pursue
8060412 in the last six months 400 000 have lost their jobs
8060413 republican fiscal policy the gift that keeps on taking thats why we need barack obama hell fight for the forgotten middle class

8060416 we cant afford four more years like the last eight years we need change and thats why we support barack obama for president we deserve a better america an america where every worker can count on a good job
8060417 whatever happend to the promise of a better america the bush administration with the help of john mccain undermined those values brothers and sisters this is our change our chance to create change

8060425 theres no safety issue youre safer on the ground than in the air
8060426 seeing how it worked out it was still a bit too bright compared to the actual fireworks
8060427 but most of the audience thought it was filmed live so that was mission accomplished
8060428 a recycling of the rubbish of fake classical culture tradition a sacrilegious visual garbage dump and an insult to the spirit of liberty low class sound play thats just noise pollution
8060429 a showcase of the reincarnation of the marxist imperialism the ultimate paragon of an all embracing culture of fascist totalitarianism an encyclopaedia that encompasses total defeat in intellectual spirit

8060433 the narrator describes a russian leader eerily similar to vladimir putin
8060434 whose strong rhetoric of recent years has only now been shown to have bite as the games intro opens a lone 2008 flashes on the screen before the narrator reads the following words the year is 2008 and the world teeters on the brink of war radical ultranationalists have seized power in moscow russian tanks sit in the caucasus mountains and the baltic forests poised to strike to the south and east the world holds its breath and waits
8060435 it is very comfortable and i really feel involved in
8060436 we are planning on staying hurdling at the moment anyhow
8060437 well give him a couple of runs and see how he goes if hes nearly top class at that we may as well stay at it thats alans potts owner of sizing europe thought anyway
8060438 he looks amazing so we are delighted with him at the moment throughout his career he has missed things for various reasons but it has usually worked out for the best so hopefully the same will be true again
8060439 right now im getting my visa and as soon as it is ready i will fly to england to sign a contract i wont play in kiev everything has happened very quickly so i couldnt even say goodbye to my team mates
8060440 i could not decide if i wanted to go to england at first first yes then no
8060441 the only thing that stopped me from leaving was my family but now all doubts are behind me and i decided to sign a contract with tottenham and the formalities are practically settled
8060442 there is a concrete sum which tottenham proposed and we have agreed the amount
8060443 if roman will agree a contract then we are ready to let him go
8060444 i appreciate it every single time i come up here theres the minster then you turn to the right and theres the ruins of sheriff hutton castle im going to get buried up there at the top of the gallops
8060445 ive told my son he can take over whenever he wants
8060446 but hes trying to wear me out first he thinks i dont know
8060447 i saw her in a field and i just stopped dead
8060448 i thought ive got to buy this one she was owned by lord grimthorpe and i bought six from him all mares and fillies for six thousand but she was the one i really wanted when i got home i rang my brother and told him id just bought a classic horse
8060449 the most wonderful thing about it was that lord grimthorpe was not one bit upset and when she won the guineas he was the first one there to shake my hand me i might have been sulking but he was a gentleman that takes some character
8060450 the only thing in its favour is that its saved me from a few thick heads
8060451 i love that meeting and after racing well always go on to the mount royale hotel in town for sing song i love a good sing song
8060452 the gimcrack is one race that id really like to win again and id also like to win one of the really big races at cheltenham as those have always evaded me the trouble is when i look like getting there i sell them i cant resist profit the temptation is always too great
8060453 i dont need to weigh a horse i can tell you what its lost as soon as i see it and whether its had a hard race or not
8060454 but i do train up a hill i was doing interval training back in 1955 and ive always said you can train any horse for any trip with a six furlong gallop
8060455 this has never felt like work to me anyway its like a hobby and ive loved every single minute of it im the luckiest man standing
8060456 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8060457 we have the man we need at last to embrace the future not the past and to dispel eight years of pain and shame barack obama is his name call the roll
8060458 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8060459 real sex education voted against affordable family planning and if elected john mccain has vowed to appoint supreme court justices who will overturn roe v wade
8060460 while families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day john mccain is sleeping better than ever
8060461 placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8060462 john mccain offers four more years of the same bush cheney policies that have failed us
8060463 this is our time to revive the spirit of kennedy
8060464 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
8060465 my inclination is you have to be careful about attacking mccain
8060466 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8060467 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8060468 all you need is 200 people in the crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
8060469 i do affirm the worth and dignity of every person but i never promised to affirm the worth and dignity of every idea some ideas are oppressive and not well thought out they lead to violence and injustice and really bad behavior i try to argue with respect and kindness but its hard when the person youre talking to acts like a jerk

8060473 ohh its offshore so we better add in some more people for communication
8060474 with the high gas prices i thought public transit was good option but thats going to go up as well
8060475 this is an appropriate time to use these rainy day funds given the unprecedented financial storm pounding metro today
8060476 buying a car isnt really an option especially with the price of fuel these days
8060477 we can have a discussion about how much and how quickly
8060478 what no one wants is being put in a situation where were forced a couple of years from now to make drastic service cuts
8060479 that is unacceptable especially now that transit is more in demand than ever
8060480 im certain we cant have a real solution until we engage the governor and the legislature
8060481 um what else do you need us to do here
8060482 this is the no see ums world were just periodically allowed to visit
8060483 oh jim his legs werent anywhere near parallel on that dive he is a shame and embarrassment to anyone whos ever loved him
8060484 ok theres the uncomfortably underclothed guy standing on the platform
8060485 there is a blur of hands and feet and spinning much like when bugs bunny and daffy duck get into a fight and all you see is the occasional fist leg and duck bill
8060486 what did you just fall off the uneven bars or something i didnt see it cause i was in the bathroom
8060487 i mean the three of us held up our end of the team competition but your inability to remain on a balance beam for 90 seconds isnt worth nearly as much as our friendship

8060498 it was kind of awkward knowing that some teachers were carrying guns
8060499 i dont feel like they should be cause we already have locked doors and cameras but i didnt feel threatened by it
8060500 as far as im concerned teachers were trained to educate my children not carry a gun even police officers need years of training in hostage situations
8060501 i dont want my child looking over her shoulder wondering whos carrying a gun
8060502 when you outlaw guns in a certain area the only people who follow that are law abiding citizens and everybody else ignores it
8060503 call me crazy but isnt it possible just possible that obamas lead is being inhibited by the fact that he is you know black
8060504 what makes obamas task of scoring white votes at kerry gore levels so formidable is to put it bluntly racial prejudice
8060505 if obama loses our children will grow up thinking of equal opportunity as a myth
8060506 to the rest of the world a rejection of the promise he represents wouldnt just be an odd choice by the united states it would be taken for what it would be sign and symptom of a nations historical decline
8060507 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me
8060508 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
8060509 the iraqi government has not stepped up to the plate
8060510 her opposition in the interview and elsewhere is built on naming three pieces of stalled iraqi legislation hmm can you name three pieces of stalled u s legislation

8060515 theres a book floating around now called none of the above that advocates exactly the position that you talked about when we do that we have advocated the antithetical position to what we know to be biblical truth because when we sit it out what were saying in essence is our vote doesnt count we dont care to influence and occupy the other persons vote takes precedence the other person de facto gets the vote
8060516 scripture says if you know whats right and you dont do it thats called sin
8060517 it seems janet parshall has set herself up as some sort of high priest who can read into scripture a commandment to vote for john mccain in 2008
8060518 i must have missed the commandment that says though shalt not sit out a presidential election or vote for any non republican presidential candidate janet parshall is certainly adding to scripture another unbiblical action when she makes that suggestion furthermore it is clear she has not read my book because she completely distorts the reasoning and purpose behind the none of the above movement which very much follows the biblical edict to influence and occupy
8060519 it says first go and tell him his fault in private
8060520 if he doesnt hear you then take one or two witnesses with you if that doesnt work you should tell it to the whole church parshall seems to have skipped steps one and two and taken political disagreement which she has twisted into an accusation of heresy and sin against me and gone straight to the television audience of a major religious broadcaster
8060521 it is nothing short of idol worship for christians to deify the republican party and its nominees for the presidency as somehow beyond reproach by discerning believers or to lift them up to the equivalent of holy writ
8060522 it is alarming to me that some within evangelicalism are using the bible to spiritually condemn other believers over political disagreements
8060523 its clear the only thing green in john mccains energy plans are the billions of dollars hes promising in more tax cuts to oil companies and the only thing that hell recycle is the same failed george bush approach to energy policy
8060524 meanwhile exxon had the largest quarterly profit in the history of the world
8060525 hes not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with
8060526 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer
8060527 and the six minute answer is smart as all get out its intellectual its well framed it takes care of all the contingencies but its a lousy soundbite
8060528 they are in love and this news makes things even better
8060529 we respect the right of elected officials such as speaker pelosi to address matters of public policy that are before them but the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops given this responsibility to teach it is important to make this correction for the record
8060530 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8060531 id rather resolve this issue without getting marvels legal department involved because we are a very small start up and lack a legal department
8060532 las personas en italia creen que las mujeres que se convierten en monjas han fallado de alguna manera y que no encuentran su lugar en el mundo pero de hecho nuestras monjas son muy educadas son inteligentes han estudiado y algunas son muy bellas as que quer amos frenar esta idea equivocada que existe sobre las monjas
8060533 i want it fixed im tired of driving on a torn up street it makes our street look trashy our neighborhood look trashy
8060534 everybody was in the same situation there are higher priorities that have to get done
8060535 daisy daisy give me your answer do im half crazy all for the love of you
8060536 a monumental contribution and captured the mood and spirit of a whole generation in their reflections and attitudes
8060537 if there is any humanity and empathy in my work which i think there is i would rather owe it to her
8060538 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is sic going to solve the sectarian violence there
8060539 overall violence is down at least 80 percent since the surge began and ethno sectarian violence the kind that seemed to be sucking iraq into all out civil war in 2006 is down by over 90 percent
8060540 by and large whats left of the insurgency is just trying to hang on
8060541 as we have surged into neighborhoods to protect the iraqi people earning their trust and benefiting from their help violence has dropped and locals have turned against the jihadists
8060542 the iraqi people are going about their business and business is thriving it is so more and more i see it in places i could not go even six months ago
8060543 the simple fact is that sending in over 20 000 additional troops isnt the answer in fact its a tragic mistake
8060544 it wont end the violence it wont provide security it wont turn back the clock and avoid the civil war that is already underway it wont deter terrorists who have a completely different agenda it wont rein in the militias
8060545 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
8060546 for the first time in decades the pay equity gap grew wider after many women were forced onto individual contracts that stripped their pay to the barest levels in many cases illegally underpaying them and removing job security
8060547 madonna seems to be an extraordinarily brilliant business woman in the business of culture
8060548 shes controlled her controversy so every time shes been in controversy it does her good not bad
8060549 outrageous to invoke nazi imagery in the context of john mccains candidacy
8060550 the whole notion of a democratic republic is that this wasnt just about politicians that anyone could shoot their mouth off about whatever they wanted to
8060551 were in a sad situation if were turning to entertainers for political wisdom
8060552 with more resources and amazons expertise in building a platform where people come to share ideas there are a lot of new opportunities in the future that will benefit each of you

8060611 sometimes these thunderstorm cells can produce tornadoes and strong straight line winds
8060612 some of the spruce trees are over 30 feet tall its ripped them right out of the ground
8060613 it picked up a full 45 gallon water barrel and tossed it across the yard like it was empty
8060614 i think the russians want to divert attention from georgia and annoy the americans
8060615 we hope its going to be adopted by the council
8060616 we are all hugely proud of everything you have achieved over the last number of weeks
8060617 there are issues to be dealt with by all the olympic family in ensuring that such occurrences are eliminated in the future
8060618 there was achievement after achievement and you went out and did it on the toughest stage of all and we look forward to working with you all in building on this success
8060619 shame on you barack obama enough with the speeches and the big rallies and then using tactics that are right out of karl roves playbook
8060620 senator obama holds up his original opposition to the war on the campaign trail but he didnt start working aggressively to end the war until he started running for president so when he had a chance to act on his speech he chose silence instead
8060621 last summer he basically threatened to bomb pakistan which i dont think was a particularly wise position to take
8060622 so you decide which makes more sense entrust our country to someone who is ready on day one or to put america in the hands of someone with little national or international experience who started running for president the day he arrived in the u s senate
8060623 well you know senator obama it is very difficult having a straight up debate with you because you never take responsibility for any vote and that has been a pattern
8060624 if we dont have universal health care we will be betraying the democratic partys principles sen obamas plan does not and cannot cover all americans
8060625 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8060626 now i could stand up here and say lets just get everybody together lets get unified the skies will open the light will come down celestial choirs will be singing and everyone will know we should do the right thing and the world will be perfect
8060627 is incorrect in insinuating thatjohn mccain himself has brought up ayers
8060628 membership is made up largely of minority blocs that are all against the white person
8060629 the democrat sic party is the minority party there is no question about it obama is a minority a halfminority at least the membership is made up largely of minority blocs the hispaniccaucus and the gay caucus caucusesthat are all against the white person
8060630 tryingto pose as a centrist party trying to win over the white male voter
8060631 was das techcrunch blog f r webstartups ist woot macher matt rutledge ber sein erfolgsgeheimnis woot ist mit einem jahresumsatz von 117 4 mio dollar 2007 gerade vom inc magazine zum wachstumsst rksten h ndler gek rt worden bei der gelegenheit verr t woot macher matt rutledge auch seine as a wholesaler i saw a niche the product life cycle is so short today every six to eight months new merchandise comes out and manufacturers have to get rid of the old stuff as quickly as possible everybodys chasing that leading edge but theres an awful lot of opportunity in the trailing edge
8060632 there is nothing in his presence that aids encourages abets in any way the conduct of any of the individuals however culpable they may or may not be
8060633 there is a good deal of circumstantial evidence presented by the crown but it doesnt stand alone
8060634 there is no reasonable alternative to the theory of the crown
8060635 simple acts of kindness dont amount to culpability in cases such as this
8060636 in our law we generally speaking do not have an affirmative duty to act and the failure to do so does not make you guilty of a criminal offence
8060637 it depends on your view of the case law we put forward one view defence puts forward the other view and the judge decides
8060638 weve got some big plans ahead with more resources and amazons expertise in building a platform where people come to share ideas there are a lot of new opportunities in the future that will benefit each of you
8060639 these individuals were not paid informants and no payments were made to them to work for the united states the co operation provided by them was not contingent upon receiving payment from the united states
8060640 the only monies paid to them were reimbursements of travel expenses they incurred in seeking information in this case and payment toward expenses that they incurred when relocating due to harassment retribution and retaliation based upon the assistance they had provided
8060641 this was an endlessly fascinating process already and its still got some twists and turns between now and november
8060642 its like you know having dinner with three people for seven years and getting quite bored of each other
8060643 so its having a fourth person new opinion i think its gonna be interesting
8060644 kara has a good reputation of a having hits and b having an opinion and thats a good combination
8060645 concerned about the audience and acceptance time will tell well see
8060646 i know kara and she speaks her mind so she will be speaking her mind
8060647 i wore pyjamas the girls wore negligees and we kind of broke the ice
8060648 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8060649 we have the man we need at last to embrace the future not the past and to dispel eight years of pain and shame barack obama is his name call the roll
8060650 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8060651 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
8060652 my inclination is you have to be careful about attacking mccain
8060653 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8060654 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8060655 this is a fabrication by the sudanese government and some criminals
8060656 we denounce and condemn this act we want the protection of civilians wherever they are this is a dirty conspiracy to defame
8060657 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8060658 abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognized borders of georgia and its going to remain so
8060659 this recognition violates georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty and is contrary to un security council resolutions supported by russia as well as to the six point peace plan brokered by french president nicolas sarkozy on behalf of the eu
8060660 canada supports the democratic and legitimate government of georgia russia must fulfil its international obligations reconsider its actions and co operate fully with the international community to resolve the crisis in georgia in a peaceful manner
8060661 georgia chose the least human way to achieve its goal to absorb south ossetia by eliminating a whole nation
8060662 short of losing our dignity as a nation we couldnt act otherwise
8060663 but russian leaders are guilty too because they kept this conflict warm for many years and tried to use it as a political instrument
8060664 i think all of us and obviously i include my own family in this we expect that when we shop that the things we buy or that we eat are going to be safe
8060665 this is a serious concern thats why i indicated that its necessary to reform and revamp our food and product inspection regimes
8060666 i want to make sure that we have the highest public safeguards and safety nets in place thats where my focus has been
8060667 i would be concerned about any proposal which might weaken ontario and or canadian safety guidelines
8060668 i think all members of the government has been on top of this
8060669 i think we all feel tremendously for those who have been affected by this terrible development and i want to express my condolences to those families that have been affected
8060670 failed to maintain a level of sanitariness suitable to prevent the contamination of food products
8060671 if the maple leaf foods defendant has exercised reasonable care in maintaining sanitary conditions that were suitable and had diligently been testing its products the food products in question would not have been recalled
8060672 the plaintiff became incredibly ill and was resultantly bed ridden for a period of three or four consecutive days after eating a recalled product
8060673 i thought i wouldnt buy any sort of sliced cold meats for a bit
8060674 its listeriosis with maple leaf today but i mean there might be another problem tomorrow
8060675 im just going to stop for a while until everythings cool again
8060676 i just dont want to get sick and miss school and not get my credit
8060677 a way forward in a sea of market based initiatives to save wild fish
8060678 flawed data reef fisheries and food security a close inspection of marine fisheries catches in mozambique tanzania fiji and the solomon islands
8060679 the fact is 90 percent of the people in the entertainment business come from the working class
8060680 the fact is 90 percent of the people in the entertainment business come from the working class
8060681 a whore a gold digger a fantasist and a liar
8060682 theyve called me a whore a gold digger a fantasist a liar the most unbelievably hurtful things and ive stayed quiet for my daughter
8060683 weve had death threats ive been close to suicide im so upset about this ive had worse press than a paedophile or a murderer and ive done nothing but charity for 20 years
8060684 who created those death threats the media a certain part of the tabloid media created such a hate campaign against me it put my life and my daughters life at risk
8060685 thats why i considered killing myself because i thought if i was dead at least my daughter would be safe
8060686 my plan is to change the law in the european parliament and i will do it and im fed up with the specific portion of the media
8060687 some of them are still supportive but a specific portion are abusing me i will investigate each and every one of those journalists
8060688 its fine that paul can walk in to court going are you all right and im hiding and i am the one that is abused daily
8060689 i have protected paul for this long and i am trying to protect him but i am being pushed to the edge and i dont want my daughter when she is 12 going on the internet reading this totally one sided story
8060690 the woman has lost and the poor father have lost their daughter what are we doing as a nation
8060691 what are we doing persecuting a woman that is devastated behind closed doors and trying to hold it together as i have for 18 months what did the paparazzi do to diana they chased her and they killed her
8060692 every time you buy one of those you contribute to it so force a change for responsible journalism
8060693 my sister was crying her eyes out because that awful jordan and peter andre did a joke on sunday and ive had six amputee girls crying their eyes out because theyre getting bullied at school because people are joking about the loss of my limb
8060694 jonathan ross said shes such an effing liar were going to find out shes got two legs instead of one
8060695 they think they are heading straight to the final and fans are now voting for who they want to win
8060696 its going to be an emotional rollercoaster for those who have sat on the fence all this time because they will finally have to come clean about how they feel about the others
8060697 but missing out on a place in the final could be the best thing to ever happen to one of them
8060698 they have the potential to earn more than they if they had made it through to the final but fell at the last hurdle
8060699 although rtl is unlikely to be able to finance a full takeover on its own the combination of rtl and media investor haim saban is likely to be seen as a more credible buyer
8060700 there is no value to be created in selling businesses that are not performing well we are not at that point and do not see any time in the next three years that we will be at that point
8060701 no human footsteps the semicircle is the imprint of an owls wings
8060702 when the prey loses it loses its life when the predator misses it loses its dinner
8060703 but it also looks to my untrained eye too flatly even for a bird in flight snowprint
8060704 they are already involved its just a question of how they take that forward they could set up their own store but thats a harder sell they didnt exactly set the world on fire when they tried to offer tv content
8060705 this venture has some potential downsides including the old chestnut that if a service is restricted to legal content in the same breath it is a restricted catalogue people are used to looking for music online and getting it all look at the beatles you can easily find illegal content online but there is not one legal service that offers it
8060706 he was a pioneer said bruce davis executive director of arts council silicon valley
8060707 he was a great local hero to me said nancy wiener who served on arts committees with schiro through the years
8060708 he had a very classy elegant look about him but he also had that soft touch as strong an advocate as henry was for the things he believed in he never came on really strong he worked with you in a very gentle way
8060709 anytime he picked up to call someone for a donation they never said no said marilyn dorsa who chaired the medici ball with mr
8060710 he was a san jose guy his daughter stephanie ronco said
8060711 i put that incident in the perspective of all the good he did for the community and i certainly come down on the side of the good said former san jose mayor susan hammer
8060712 he was just a dear man he was kind and thoughtful and really cared about his family and the san jose community
8060713 the music is what really kept him going that is really the legacy that allowed him to persevere from that circumstance
8060714 was the one here holding up the tent said artistic director kevin hauge
8060715 ie 6 cant provide the same web experience that modern browsers can
8060716 continued support of ie 6 means that we cant optimize our interfaces or provide an enhanced customer experience in our apps supporting ie 6 means slower progress less progress and in some places no progress
8060717 most blog spam comes from bots that either fake or as a trojan use internet explorer 6 of infected systems
8060718 we all know that ie6 is outdated and has horrible css rendering engine however most average internet users havent realized that yet why because we put our hard work on it and patch the bugs by various ie hacks
8060719 the 2008 vision awards winners exemplify the drive and innovation necessary to be successful in the construction industry
8060720 as the impressive group of previous vision award winners has done these companies have chosen to improve their businesses by implementing leading edge technology solutions to serve their customers more efficiently
8060721 its a thrill and an honor to win another technology award
8060722 tim schaeffer communities is an exemplary company and were proud to serve them with our technology platform
8060723 as an african american and a lesbian i havent been through one day without facing some sort of discrimination but this is just shocking
8060724 we believe that the actions of the contract security guard were inappropriate and unacceptable we have notified his company paragon of our position in the matter
8060725 in 30 years as an activist this is one of the most unsettling things i have seen when she called me i told her to wait right there
8060726 for her to be told to leave was completely unnecessary especially considering how peaceful and quiet she was responding the the security officers
8060727 nobody in that office felt her t shirt was offensive by any means
8060728 loud unreasonable aggressive and angry approach to the situation almost caused chaos
8060729 i haven t seen this type of blatant discrimination in a federal office building before
8060730 alejandro vargas comenta en su blog sobre la forma en que se aborda el tema de g nero en la cobertura de sucesos en costa rica
8060731 every dhb would have formal controls over the management of controlled drugs such as opiates
8060732 i personally think dhbs have an obligation to support staff with addiction problems or dependence on chemicals
8060733 but of course if its a security issue and drugs are going missing and being sold for example then thats an entirely different disciplinary matter
8060734 to me if the drug was contained in an ampoule it would be difficult to dilute it and replace it at that point perhaps its when the drug is being used with the patient and transferred from the ampoule or vial over to an iv system it may be easier to dilute it at that point
8060735 i think dhbs in particular i think they should look at the potential for staff to use drugs for their own use if they have a potential problem and maybe refer them to their occupational health unit or the doctors health advisory service accordingly
8060736 i think forever im going to be his little sister
8060737 if she does everything the opposite of what ive been doing she will be no 1 for a long time
8060738 shes totally ready to win her first grand slam im really proud of the way shes handling the pressure
8060739 a lot of people used the shelter after hearing about it from us
8060740 its a very efficient system and we can fine tune it to call only people who live on one side of a single street we want people without land lines in the database so they will benefit from these calls too
8060741 clearly that is insufficient we need to make this available to all our residents
8060742 increased atmospheric carbon has a warming effect on the earth
8060743 while the scope and long term consequences of this warming effect are the subject of ongoing research we believe the united states should take measured and reasonable steps today
8060744 2008 is set to be about the 10th warmest year since 1850
8060745 theres no mystery about gravity sir isaac newton figured most of it out over 300 years ago and einstein pinned it down about 100 years ago so theres no room left for any mystery at all
8060746 theyre spending a veritable assload of money designing instruments sensitive enough to detect them
8060747 theyre seeking to turn back the contract weve had at some hospitals for 25 years with
8060748 they are really taking a very important leadership role and setting a very high example for others to follow
8060749 the big risk for us of course is that they may say gee were just not going to give any money to stanford
8060750 we want to be sure were not contributing to the marketing of products
8060751 companies have taken steps to separate the grant making process for educational programs from their marketing efforts according to a statement issued by the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america which represents many large drug and biotechnology companies
8060752 i couldnt imagine why she was so excited i thought cant everyone do this
8060753 he gave lots of lessons and was always asking me to sit for him
8060754 i was a very grumpy 13 year old and i had all of these posters of movie stars on my walls on saturdays my best friend and i would go up on her roof and cut out pictures of our favorite stars from movie magazines and paste them into our scrapbooks we especially loved nelson eddy wed hold his photos up and tell him we were going to show him an australian sunset
8060755 i dont know how it came to me to try watercolor but when i did it was so much faster and easier than making all those little strokes from then on pen and ink were out
8060756 i love painting eyes they really are the windows to the soul
8060757 if i see a photograph of a face and it has good contrast ill do a painting its especially good if the person isnt showing any teeth i hate to paint teeth
8060758 in those days the stars were always being asked for autographs so it wasnt such a big deal
8060759 every time id paint a celebrity id send a duplicate of the painting so he or she could keep it making a copy was much quicker than painting the original
8060760 id like to kiss ya but i just washed my hair
8060761 her assistant was also named marie and she would call occasionally to chat she told me that alice received many paintings and drawings of herself but marees are the best i shouldnt say so but i liked hearing that
8060762 ive always been interested in indian history particularly the partitioning of india and pakistan
8060763 not sweepstakes anyone can send in his or her name address and phone number i liked the contests that required some skill
8060764 i won several trips to israel hawaii disneyland and so many tvs and transistor radios i cant even count
8060765 cal and i were always going out to dinner or to the symphony or someplace with my contest prizes
8060766 the mayor came up to me afterwards and said you ought to be in politics kid
8060767 here was this woman with these enormous well she had quite a figure
8060768 i didnt want him to be too disappointed when he got home
8060769 i could have used those a while back when i had a mastectomy but its been 4 1 2 years now and im still cancer free so im very thankful for that
8060770 love is the net where hearts are caught like fish
8060771 i wrote to him asking if he would sign a portrait of him that i had done
8060772 he wrote back saying he would have to see it first i wrote back to him saying if i were in your position id do the same and enclosed the painting with a self addressed stamped envelope sure enough he autographed it and sent it back
8060773 i wrote to sen obama asking for a picture he sent back a lovely photograph of his wife and him along with his autograph
8060774 this will be the first time ive actually been able to vote
8060775 im always writing to my representatives giving them my two cents they need to hear our voices
8060776 its become hard to send the paintings to the stars i dont blame them they never know whats inside an envelope if i send something out im afraid i wont get it back but im going to keep doing the portraits as long as i can if there ever came a time when i couldnt paint well life just wouldnt be worth living anymore

8060783 i think each and every member state is very clear that it is of the utmost importance to find a common position and i am going to do whatever i can so that we succeed
8060784 the russian federations actions are an attempt to militarily annex a sovereign nation the nation of georgia
8060785 this a challenge to the entire world not just georgia
8060786 the point here is the russians are bluffing and theyre overplaying their hand
8060787 i am holding talks today with international partners and will be visiting ukraine to ensure the widest possible coalition against russian aggression in georgia
8060788 the ball is in the europeans court if they want a worsening in relations they will get it of course
8060789 if they want to maintain strategic relations which is in my opinion totally in the interests of russia and europe everything will go well

8060793 investigations by unama united nations assistance mission in afghanistan found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men
8060794 in kurdistan there is no freedom for journalists i have proof of that the most recent proof was soran
8060795 we dont know who killed him but we do know that the government didnt care
8060796 its like you know having dinner with three people for seven years and getting quite bored of each other

8060813 a professional organization holding this kind of data should have tested the disks to make sure the information was destroyed
8060814 graphic data has confirmed to us that one of their machines appears to have been inappropriately sold on via a third party
8060815 as a result historical data relating to credit card applications from some of our customers and data from other banks were not removed we take this issue extremely seriously and are working to resolve this regrettable loss with graphic data as a matter of urgency
8060816 the it equipment that appeared on ebay was not planned to be disposed of by the company and investigations are still ongoing to find out how this equipment was removed from one of graphic datas secure locations
8060817 we take customer privacy and data security very seriously this incident is extremely regrettable and were taking every possible step to retrieve the data and ensure this is an isolated incident
8060818 it is essential that companies have appropriate procedures in place to ensure that personal records are kept secure at all times the ico said in a statement
8060819 if companies are disposing of computer equipment they must take the necessary steps to ensure that any personal information stored on the hard drive is rendered unrecoverable we are now investigating this potential data breach and will be seeking an urgent explanation from graphic data to establish what has gone wrong and the steps that are being taken to prevent a similar incident occurring
8060820 i hope that john morganelli understands what he did is wrong and immediately sends the city of harrisburg the 6 that he stiffed the city

8060822 any democrat or republican who said they were going to support us on health care or free choice and turns against us is going to paint a target

8060824 our members are sick and tired of politicians who are after their votes the day before the election and after their throats
8060825 for our members politics is not about democrats or republicans or left or right its about right and wrong

8060834 no es posible que una decisi n de la corte suprema afecte los recursos que en este caso ser an recursos del estado p blicos porque el banco central asumi la responsabilidad en esas pocas de devolver el dinero a los ahorristas
8060835 creemos que rub n costas est siguiendo un curso de post grado de separatismo porque goldberg es especialista en separar pa ses como lo hizo en bosnia y ahora le debe estar tomando examen
8060836 este virrey que se hace llamar embajador se cree due o del destino del pa s o quiere recordar la influencia que ten a antes
8060837 creemos que el pa s ha dejado de ser el patio trasero de los imperios y por esa raz n es que la embajada de los estados unidos insiste con la media luna para desestabilizar al gobierno y seguir con la dependencia como lo hizo con gonzalo s nchez de lozada
8060838 shannon visit el chapare tambi n el embajador de eeuu lo ha hecho recurrentemente visitando pando por lo menos hoy yo tengo el compromiso de dos embajadores que van a estar en pando no es el embajador de eeuu pero hay libertad de acci n
8060839 no voy a caer en el expediente de satanizar la reuni n con el embajador de estados unidos que hubiera tenido el prefecto costas porque en el marco de las relaciones internacionales hay relaciones establecidas y que est n siguiendo un curso y un proceso
8060840 my goal is to provide an alternative not to free the mac os
8060841 what we want to do is to provide an alternative an option its not that people dont want to use mac os many people are open to the idea but theyre not used to spending an exorbitant amount of money on something that is essentially generic hardware
8060842 id recommend just getting started interviews are the easiest way to get content up quickly and they keep the host from having to carry an entire 15 or 20 minute show interview people within your organization but also reach out to the people you serve who have interesting stories to tell and interview them as well anything that helps you connect with your audience in a more human way will be well received
8060843 the big lesson from the 2008 new media expo is that individuals and organizations can still connect with their constituents directly by starting a blog podcast or online video series even if they dont create media as their primary business although production quality matters being genuine with your audience and putting a human face on any organization is whats important with the tools becoming less expensive each day and editing software becoming easier to use anyone really can do this
8060844 we have proven that podcasts are an effective channel for delivering health messages and we have learned a lot in the process of developing those podcasts now its time to take our podcasting to the next level by being strategic and creating more personalized podcasts
8060845 theres a lot to learn many connections to be made and many new people coming into the social media space every day

8060849 the entrenched powers of the bush cheney years have everything to gain from keeping things just the way they are they will pull out all the stops to elect john mccain because they know hell keep looking out for them
8060850 but i have news for them their days are numbered
8060851 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8060852 i have a better idea lets give them four more months and then elect barack obama
8060853 west virginians value hard work patriotism and faith in god they mine the coal make the steel and work the assembly lines that make our industries tick their experience and knowledge has earned each of them a ph d in life they can shake your hand look you in the eye and touch your heart
8060854 and let me tell you something they cant afford four more years like the last eight they need and deserve better from washington
8060855 now the oil companies are placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8060856 mccain has voted against tax credits for renewable energy 11 times and his only idea to solve our energy crisis is to keep doing what were doing as we watch prices go up and up and up
8060857 it is encouraging to see the extent of which green measures have become a central factor when buying and selling houses
8060858 in the current economic climate it makes sense to ensure that the running costs of the home you are living in or buying are as low as possible as well as helping to cut down on your carbon dioxide emissions
8060859 ensuring that a home is as energy efficient as possible is a great way to help make sure that you keep bills down over the longer term

8060864 although most retired homeowners have seen the value of equity in their homes fall in recent months its important that they dont lose sight of the bigger picture which is that despite current falling property prices in the vast majority of cases retired homeowners have built up a significant amount of equity in their homes over a number of years
8060865 together with the rising cost of living means that many more people are now looking to release equity from their homes to maintain or improve their standard of living in retirement
8060866 equity release schemes can be an excellent way to help do this and any provider who is ship registered provides a no negative equity guarantee as well as guaranteeing that the mortgage interest rate is fixed for the term of the loan
8060867 his name and what he achieved its so far out of any players reach in his time or any player who has played since its almost like he played a different game to what were playing

8060874 i cant imagine how traumatic it was being swept away by the water
8060875 if we have the same storm intensity it would be worse
8060876 given all of these considerations we believe it imperative as nasa continues the transition from the to the successor vehicles that the means for producing additional flight hardware and obtaining additional flight engineering and support services not be completely and irretrievable lost through destruction or deterioration at least until a clear path to alternative launch capabilities is at hand
8060877 at minimum direct nasa to take no action for at least one year from now that would preclude the extended use of the space shuttle beyond 2010
8060878 i have a county car ive already turned the car in i have a county credit card ive turned those in

8061075 tight credit is a continuing issue but another challenge for sellers right now is buyer psychology
8061076 if buyers expect prices to fall in the future they are more likely to postpone their purchases
8061077 the most overbuilt areas of the country including california nevada arizona and florida contrast greatly with most other states where prices are declining more moderately or even increasing

8061120 ok make your mouth into a tight but not too tight circle then blow with steady air through your lips while theyre buzzing and dont forget to count
8061121 do you think you can practice that when were gone
8061122 obama has proven hes willing to turn on anyone just to be president hes not black hes biracial and he wasnt even raised by black people barack doesnt embody the values and characteristics we as black people are raised with
8061123 one drop of black blood and youre black the truth is every african american is biracial go back far enough and youll find the massah was in the slave quarters
8061124 his record being wrong on foreign policy is as long as his years in foreign policy
8061125 talking about bromides of such a generic nature that we dont know where hed actually lead
8061126 its important that we tell people who barack obama is and where he wants to take this country
8061127 youll see a lot more about the choice in this election
8061128 every effort to try and portray john mccain as someone that doesnt connect with the american people will fall extraordinarily short just as short as the effort to say hes the continuation of george w bush
8061129 what republicans consider to be the greatest threat of the civilized world
8061130 john mccain earned his homes through the hard work insight and fortitude of his family and himself
8061131 i dont think the politics of envy end up being successful in the final analysis
8061132 impenetrable thicket of words i dont know if anyone is ready to debate him
8061133 that just points out that john mccain is his own man
8061134 this is heading down the track of privatisation of water and creating ownership rights so it can be traded
8061135 the labour led government would not support such a move as we believe water is owned by all new zealanders
8061136 if we dont act the current system will see all major catchments fully allocated by 2012
8061137 in many cases delinquent oil bills dont get posted to the large credit reporting agencies
8061138 given the current situation of the industry where bills are large and consumers are getting shut off they tend to jump from one company to another
8061139 back in the day we were never pressed for money like we are now
8061140 we believe we can work through the public process first and they can offer some relief but it can always come down to a lawsuit
8061141 clouded the quality of life that was the reason i bought here
8061142 someone has done a job on us take them down period i dont need to look at it
8061143 the government must not hastily push through the passage of the bill tt the way forward is to bring back english as the main medium of teaching rather than bm malaysian medical resources all rights reserved
8061144 were hoping to see the state government and talk about their role in looking after the business community in tasmania
8061145 rail transport is the backbone of the fingal mine and we understand the importance of the mine to the local community
8061146 we have had a visit from three prospective purchasers to the railton cement works
8061147 it was a familiarisation visit they asked questions about the operations these three prospective purchasers are precluded by a confidentiality need from talking to us about the commercials
8061148 but we look forward to talking to the bidders when its appropriate to do so
8061149 we look forward to working with stone as we continue our turnaround efforts his extensive experience working with companies in trying economic environments will be a significant asset to the company

8061152 the payment was made by me to assist funding the legal costs incurred personally by rt hon winston peters mp concerning his election petition dispute at his request
8061153 mr peters sought help from me for this purpose in a personal conversation some time after i had first met him in sydney
8061154 i agreed to help in the belief that this step would also assist the labour party in its relationship with mr peters i supported the labour party
8061155 some time after i had first met him in sydney
8061156 its very clear now that winston peters has misled the public of new zealand
8061157 why this country is a shining city on a hill
8061158 i always vote in my decisions based on the law and the facts before us and anyone who knows my record knows that
8061159 nesss vote is widely thought to have been a bid to win her reappointment to the fcc
8061160 isnt john mccain lucky he was captured and tortured in vietnam
8061161 has he used his experience at the hanoi hilton for political gain
8061162 given his stance on torture could it be that he has overstated how bad it was
8061163 his frequent skin cancer the condition with his arms are those real or is it possible that he knows without them he couldnt get elected dog catcher
8061164 what kind of soulless conscienceless individual could manipulate his good fortune at getting to come home when so many were left behind
8061165 this is a fabrication by the sudanese government and some criminals
8061166 we denounce and condemn this act we want the protection of civilians wherever they are this is a dirty conspiracy to defame
8061167 i brought two bags from home but there was a third that i left behind in this new country apart from the struggles that made me a stranger were your needs of the ones who bid me goodbye those i left behind among the papers i collected you had put a small bag of sweets i left behind there were divisions at home there were other possibilities there were communities in my town there were communities where i came i found a job called it a struggle for survival everything else i left behind i didnt want to forget my traditions the tradition of forgetting i left behind bags passport my shoes crossed the yellow lines something was left behind here i am a sum of different parts travel agents everywhere are selling ads for the parts that were left behind
8061168 the magician you are powerful and wise beyond what anyone can see deeply complex you have the resources to connect to the spiritual and material world you possess the knowledge to manipulate your life and the lives around you you also have a great healing power should you choose to use it your fortune you have unhidden powers that you have yet to tap into soon you will better understand how to use your intellect and intuition believe it or not you will discover how you can manipulate yourself and others for good you are at the beginning of a path of spiritual enlightenment
8061169 check your departure airport to see if your flight may be affected
8061170 we have our engineers looking at it and were doing a complete investigation
8061171 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8061172 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8061173 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8061174 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8061175 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8061176 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals
8061177 ongoing investigation and yesterdays action was just the first part
8061178 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs
8061179 it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8061180 well thats even worse selecting someone for the publicity value
8061181 in past elections weve run into things where people were more or less denied the right to vote and harassed
8061182 many studies have noted the fact that rls has a far reaching symptom spectrum that can severely impact and limit several aspects of everyday life the pramipexole clinical trials reinforce the need for a simple effective treatment for people with rls to address these symptoms including limb pain and associated mood disorder in addition to the characteristic rls symptoms these important new findings reaffirm pramipexole as an effective pharmacological regimen for the treatment of rls the studies have proven that pramipexole can offer patient specific benefits which combined can lead to significant improvement of patients overall quality of life

8061192 its great to come home and be welcomed by so many kiwis it makes all the hard work worthwhile
8061193 new details on nevada man linked to alleged obama plot
8061194 as i recall it has been a while there were a couple of times we had contacts with him i cannot say what they were because he was a juvenile at the time but we did have some issues as a kid
8061195 if i remember right he was from a broken home seemed to have some dysfunction there he had a little sister in my daughters class too so he seemed to be a fairly quiet kid not a trouble maker
8061196 as to lindsays comment above about one brief speech the rule is simple if you dont mean it dont say it kiwis want to be able to take people at their word not be told later they were misunderstood
8061197 if act wanted a strong stance on welfare this election they would have gone for the lindsay steroids experience option of muriel the fact that neither are there says policy emphasis is elsewhere
8061198 no argument that lindsay is a good researcher and publisher on welfare matters but if thats all it took to be a good mp then the parliamentary librarians and most of academia would be running the country
8061199 if a public dummy spit is lindsays reaction to this event the act party can accurately anticipate her being a management problem if she didnt get her way on a bill pq or vote maybe theyd already seen some of this behaviour who knows theres no i in team as the cliche goes
8061200 well you have said you arent a party member so frankly your opinion counts for little im afraid
8061201 lets have our best people at the top of that list
8061202 wearing a gray t shirt khaki pants and a healthy stubble the daily show host told reporters at a university of denver breakfast that foxs fair and balanced slogan is an insult to people with brains
8061203 citing a pew research center study showing the network has the most balanced audience in cable news 39 percent republicans and 33 percent democrats
8061204 jeez kevin calling you an asshole would be a huge understatement wouldnt it
8061205 i havent seen anything from apple that seems to show its attack ing the enterprise market
8061206 in the end it departments want their employees to be as productive as humanly possible so theyll approve tools that people are more comfortable with

8061210 we test almost everything even things that you would think are so small that we could not possibly care nor could they possibly matter in fact small changes do matter and we do care

8061213 her condition has significantly deteriorated since august four when she was brought to new york
8061214 she dr siddiqui should be transferred to bellevue hospital for urgent medical and psychological treatment
8061215 was consistent with that of a potential offspring of aafia siddiqui
8061216 the child is an american citizen he is not a pakistani citizen
8061217 i like to hate the game as much as possible and believe that its ugly with horrible gameplay and that nobody will like it
8061218 if this were a human relationship it would be very unhealthy and
8061219 is going to have to pick up a fungo bat and hit john mccain with it
8061220 i told the obama campaign early on if they wanted a slash and burn contrasting speaker that is not me
8061221 they are the cleaners the hawker assistants who despite the governments mantra of helping citizens help themselves are so down and out they have no way of helping themselves
8061222 what is worse than being poor being poor in singapore
8061223 but the only viable long term solution is economic growth retraining of workers and consequently higher salaries for them
8061224 but mrs yu foo the growth of the last 4 years did nothing much for the poor they became poorer shouldnt we be looking at something else
8061225 you can still have parties just like at past conventions but you need to talk to a lawyer to make sure youre not putting your donors your sponsors your guests members of congress and staff in an ethical quandary
8061226 the relevant ethics committees have advised us of their decision and we have informed all staff of that
8061227 its up to each individual staff member to decide their attendance for those who come it will be an informative and exciting event
8061228 if they undertake reasonable good faith efforts to make sure every house staffer pays theyll likely be ok
8061229 his record being wrong on foreign policy is as long as his years in foreign policy
8061230 talking about bromides of such a generic nature that we dont know where hed actually lead

8061239 quality health care as a fundamental right and not a privilege
8061240 righteousness exalteth a nation but sin is a reproach to any people
8061241 be strong and of good courage and do it fear not nor be dismayed for the lord god even my god will be with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee
8061242 i can do everything through him who gives me strength
8061243 god who gave us life gave us liberty can the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of god indeed i tremble for my country when i reflect that god is just that his justice cannot sleep forever
8061244 i predict future happiness for americans if they can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people under the pretense of taking care of them
8061245 obviously she knew while shes the victim she clearly didnt stand in the way of the cover up
8061246 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
8061247 the question for her as well as for him is what is their foundation what gives them a platform to engage in public issues
8061248 their big challenge is convincing people that they will continue to be active in politics and theyre going to continue to have a voice
8061249 an imperfect man with a truly progressive vision who spoke to and for those whom others ignored yes that is who i supported
8061250 an imperfect man who had come to face his own imperfections and was seeking to redeem himself to those closest to him yes that is who i supported
8061251 she knew she should not have participated in him running for president with this bomb waiting to go off she did she kinda loses my sympathy
8061252 i believe we are all owed a huge apology not self serving claims for pity by both john and elizabeth edwards who both knew about the affair and both decided to go forward and seek the democratic candidacy regardless of the titanic risk
8061253 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
8061254 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
8061255 stated simply by implementing programs to help customers to use even less gas the company is at the same time undermining its financial health
8061256 providing the utility with a mandate and incentive to provide efficiency and conservation programs without decoupling is like accelerating a car with one foot while applying the brakes with the other
8061257 increase costs to consumers at a time when they cannot afford the rates they are already required to pay
8061258 it wouldnt require national grid to do anything beyond what it already receives an incentive to do
8061259 shifts risk from the company to the ratepayer but does not compensate the ratepayer in any way for assuming these new risks decoupling primarily serves the companys goal of improving its earnings
8061260 the commission should find that national grids proposal is inappropriate potentially inequitable and not necessary to encourage or support the pursuit of conservation and energy efficiency improvements by rhode island gas customers

8061492 we have to reduce our dependence on oil and gas
8061493 what seemed extravagant in 2004 when we decided to go for renewables now seems to have been a very good decision
8061494 while most people are aware there are special services available to people with disabilities who find themselves facing a court situation it is not so well known that similar services are available for people with disabilities involved in police matters
8061495 it was good to know that there is a register of people who can assist with advocacy in these situations
8061496 it was also good for local people to realise they can go along to these meetings and have their say
8061497 small country clubs such as these foster our children in a wide range of sports it could come down on clubs in our area like a sledgehammer
8061498 if the leases on some of these clubs increase to such an extent they will be basically out of business
8061499 this current council probably cannot do a lot about it but the new council after the september 13 election will need to grab and run with it
8061500 the mayors of every council in regional new south wales should be putting together a framework to fight the impost
8061501 we fought the case and won writing letters and explaining our situation
8061502 men put a challenge out to your mates to work out whos got the hot rod come and do yourself a favour and visit our pit stop crew for your free health check
8061503 we hope the pit stop program helps men learn about health issues they havent paid much attention to we want them to then take this knowledge to the community through their sons mates and work colleagues
8061504 that meeting resulted in an agreement to carry out numerous remedial works
8061505 the constructed islands will help improve the habitat for the various birds that rest and roost in the inlet
8061506 expressions of interest are currently being prepared to go lands minister tony kelly seeking funds for further works to improve navigation around the inlet
8061507 what we have achieved is a project with maximum improvement at a minimal cost

8061511 big time sporting events provide a unique platform to educate our fans on green initiatives and we feel that the best way we can educate is to lead by example
8061512 after months of dealings and a change in the wildaid management
8061513 if we want the american people to read this weve got to produce it in a length that theyre comfortable with
8061514 this man just took my chair knocked into me look at this
8061515 i am a clinton delegate and these obama delegates are mistreating us
8061516 alabama i guess i just have this feeling that there is lingering prejudices there but maybe thats totally unfair on my part
8061517 oh michigan definitely its a good thing they didnt seat us near them
8061518 if gustav is able to thread the needle passing through the yucatan channel into the gulf of mexico it could intensify to category 4 or 5 strength over the warm water in the gulf
8061519 britney really proves how much the fans really matter because the fans really want to see britney win and turn it around
8061520 there is absolutely nothing to link hari puttar with harry potter
8061521 it is unfortunate that a major film studio would choose to exploit an ethnic slur as a sensational promotion for a movie mainstreaming a bigoted term in this manner will only serve to legitimize and normalize anti muslim prejudice in our society
8061522 miljenkos is worth as much as someone is willing to pay for it fact is that wine is the first to sell out each year in just a few months its a combination of source a 110 year old vineyard and quantity only 300 cases
8061523 as a winemaker its fun to do other things besides cabernet to challenge yourself
8061524 aaron sorkin ill be seeing you soon posted by crack september 21 2006 08 30 pm
8061525 michael you did a lot more than fetch pizza and of course i remember you
8061526 a s far as the internet making us meaner it does remove a natural censor that we have that commands us to treat people with common respect an exception apparently are the people posting on this board whose intelligence humility and wit are extremely frustrating in that theyre disproving my point and that drives me nuts
8061527 i wanted to go to stk or chop and get a great big ole steak but since miley is the breadwinner in this family she calls the shots and she picked up city wok
8061528 egg rolls are going to be super yummers happy birthday dad
8061529 growing grapes and making wine sustainably is all about stepping gently into natures realm nudging rather than fighting it
8061530 in an ideal world the sustainable winery would use only hand tools customers and workers would walk or bike here and we would refill glass bottles or goatskin bota wine bags from the barrel but the reality is we bring in farm equipment use cars and packaging materials our responsibility is to consider the big picture
8061531 from green power to green packaging we need to make quality wine and add to the quality of life of our employees and consumers
8061532 i cant begin to convey our gratitude to our loyal supporters who have made it possible for diablo ballet to reach this milestone
8061533 we increased the number of films in the festival to 70 because of the quality of the films i think our audience really responded to the variety of offerings and especially to the special programs italian jews during fascism diversity in israel and the close up on the heymann brothers
8061534 subject a apparently believes that she is being pursued she is not subject as normal pursuer subject b
8061535 is in no way involved in the current whatever it is subject a closely examines an invisible piece of dust bats at it twice discovers that its nonexistent and looks around several more times perhaps hoping to catch her enemies unawares
8061536 subject a sprints toward the kitchen failing to decelerate fast enough to avoid another collision with the pantry
8061537 instead of dashing through the door subject a leapt on the bed pounced on the sleeping subject b pummeled her briefly and raced off again out of the bedroom and back toward me
8061538 subject b may be developing a theory of events but she is looking in precisely the wrong direction as if the crows outside were her nominees for the unprovoked attack upon her person or upon her cat whatever the correct legal term is
8061539 meanwhile subject a is crouched on the back of the couch her eyes darting back and forth prepared for any emergency
8061540 subject a and subject b attack each other simultaneously there is much rolling around no injuries are incurred subject a begins licking subject bs face and the matter is satisfactorily resolved
8061541 conclusion kittens exhibit poor impulse control signs of incipient paranoia delusional behavior physically inappropriate gestures and unprovoked aggression they are most probably insane thank you

8061554 everyone acknowledges that this is a great place to grow dessert wines but its history is in table wines except for quady and ficklin
8061555 some port aficionados turn up their nose at the flavored wines
8061556 theyre particularly popular among people who like sweet wines but cant tolerate much alcohol
8061557 anything will grow here you just have to pay more for different flavor profiles
8061558 we have a large plot planted in many varieties by angelo papagni but the rhone varieties do especially well
8061559 the chardonnay does fine and we have no trouble selling it
8061560 em lia scrubbed her soles with boiled water and a loofah in order to make them white the way a ladys feet should look but the stains remained
8061561 for what she did not know not death that would have already come to her slowly and stealthily killing her little by little each day of her lonely existence
8061562 their gums bled their hair lost its pigment turning a sickly orange and falling out in knotted clumps luzias men and women began to look like terrified animals a clear slime ran from their noses their faces were gaunt and their eyes bulged the whites turned yellow
8061563 luzia felt something harden inside her like warm molasses poured into wooden blocks and set in the cold night to solidify

8061565 i learned why barack is such a fierce advocate for women and their children
8061566 smart tough women sacrificed to make barack the man he is today
8061567 my basketball buddy my friend my mentor and my inspiration
8061568 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values
8061569 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
8061570 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no you want a persistent president
8061571 each of us also comes here tonight by way of our own improbable journey
8061572 my mothers love has always been a sustaining force for our family and one of my greatest joys is seeing her integrity her compassion and her intelligence reflected in my own daughters
8061573 the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago
8061574 hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital 10 years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her what he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
8061575 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
8061576 he is a superstar amazing to watch the big buzz is his run for governor many many thumbs up coming his way
8061577 white middle aged men who lived on the eastern seaboard
8061578 that there are no good choices people get split up and can never find each other again and i saw a few frustrated faces after having to walk a mile from the car drop and then wait an hour in line to get into the pepsi center
8061579 into the rhythm of how to maneuver through it all and on balance it is incredible
8061580 many in key west no doubt breathed sighs of relief that they would be spared
8061581 until whenever we stop partying all librarians and library enthusiasts welcome
8061582 it may well be the largest collage anyone has ever made so thats my formal motivation in a nut shell mere opportunity im now beginning to realize why leonardo left so many of his masterpieces unfinished maybe they were too damn much work
8061583 the good part of him being in jail for the next seven years is that he wont be asking me for money
8061584 he knows our stories because he has lived the american dream
8061585 and from where i sit in the middle of america i see a leader who knows that the american dream is not for a special few it is for all of us
8061586 running for four more years of the exact same failed policies that we had under george bush
8061587 i know this son of a single mom will stand up for the dreams of our daughters
8061588 its the story of a woman who grew up of modest means in a small missouri town
8061589 she worked her way through college and law school waiting tables and went into public service she now works for families of modest means as a united states senator that is my story and it is an american story
8061590 its the story of a man who was brought up by a single mom and his grandparents he put himself through school with odd jobs scholarships and student loans
8061591 he took a pass on big money went to work helping families devastated by steel plant closings and dedicated his life to bringing people together through public service
8061592 the few the powerful and the extremely wealthy they did tax cuts for the wealthiest americans theyre doing everything big oil asks for and look where we are
8061593 there was some shaping but what the editor wanted was more of everything
8061594 which is a testament to what mary ann had created
8061595 that writing group was a ruse not unlike the guernsey literary society created for the express purpose of getting mary ann to write
8061596 they knew she would be forced to produce something when it was her turn
8061597 no one quite knew why germany expended so much energy on the channel islands
8061598 i drifted off into the underbrush and bumped up against german battlements
8061599 my favorite part came as we drove from st peter port to the town of st martins coming out of the city and into the countryside
8061600 there i could see that ineffable what it looks like that i needed so badly when i was writing
8061601 something halfway between normandy and the northern california coast craggy gray cliffs rolling green fields leaping bunnies old houses covered in rose vines
8061602 it was everything i had hoped it would be not only in order to be correct but in order to love it
8061603 we have great solar intensity at the latitude of tunisia coupled with a very cool microclimate
8061604 around los olivos theres gravelly clay and loam with some limestone deposits i have four soil types on my property
8061605 we have 60 different varieties and 300 cultivars clones within a 40 mile wide coastal throat its the most diverse region in the world
8061606 bordeaux grapes moving east pinot noir moving west and rhone varieties filling in the middle
8061607 the only problem will be what to call whats left over
8061608 a lot of women did believe that this was going to be year of the woman
8061609 when a lot of expectations are made and not met theres some threshing about as a result
8061610 but to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
8061611 through the prism of all they had to face growing up
8061612 i think its fair to say that a number of my supporters are upset with me
8061613 im not sure some will ever enthusiastically support me again
8061614 have got to forcefully and effectively address the issues that women care about on a daily basis
8061615 those concerns arent exclusive to women but they will greatly influence who they vote for in november

8061618 the russian invasion of georgia will reshape the strategic landscape the next u s president confronts
8061619 thank you mr president helen thomas at the white house
8061620 i think that presidents deserve to be questioned maybe irreverently most of the time to bring em down a size
8061621 access to a president doesnt mean youre gonna get the truth
8061622 i could see president kennedy was struggling so finally i got up and said thank you mr president i got him off the hook
8061623 your a loser baby so why dont we kill you
8061624 were talking about a very serious issue here that also has huge economic implications
8061625 unfortunately we have no policy framework and there are so many agencies involved with very little coordination between them blame must be shared equally at the institutional level the engineering level and the consumer level
8061626 safety is unfortunately not a big part of the purchase decision of indian consumers
8061627 our best selling small cars are typically not the safest vehicles on the road because consumers are more worried about and the cost of ownership and would rather not pay for safety features such as air bags and anti lock brakes
8061628 we do believe the need for training is becoming increasingly relevant due to the increase in vehicle volumes high speed roads enhanced performance of vehicles and the requirement of specific skills for application vehicles
8061629 as more cars are sold there is a demand for more drivers transporters also want drivers for commercial vehicles where the need for training is perhaps most acute
8061630 tata has struggled with the fact that during the boom there werent enough experienced drivers which can actually dent demand for trucks
8061631 environment experts went to the area along the longjiang river which abuts the plant to monitor the for contamination
8061632 residents within 1 km 0 6214 miles should be safe but rescuers still needed to wear masks
8061633 regional work safety authorities are investigating the cause of the accident
8061634 police have surrounded government house and have taken up their positions they are not going to disperse the crowd we are trying to negotiate
8061635 police needed to reshuffle so that the officers who were on duty since yesterday tuesday can take a rest i still insist that as of now police will not use force to disperse protesters
8061636 this is the time that the authorities will storm into the government house
8061637 they know they cannot let protesters stay because we will make trouble for the government there are a lot of people who want to join us but have been blocked by the police
8061638 they the pad want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and stage a coup again
8061639 i will not resign i will stay to protect this country
8061640 compruebe si su datos son correctos de lo contario pulse en
8061641 episode of actual experience represented realistically and with little alteration in a dramatic fictional or journalistic work
8061642 it would probably be good if i kissed him back

8061645 today is an extremely sad day for the trail blazers family
8061646 kevin will be remembered by fans as one of the most popular and recognizable players to ever wear the blazers uniform but to people who knew him hell be remembered as one of the warmest and biggest hearted
8061647 if it werent for bad luck id have no luck at all
8061648 shipwreck victims who lose hope may die after a few days even though physiologically they could have survived many days longer
8061649 god causes everything to work together for the good of those who love god
8061650 i thought you would be the first to greet us instead my little lady met up with us first
8061651 but i know my boundaries she does not want me
8061652 lady mary he is always like this you shall get used to his ways he teases and means nothing by them right evaleen
8061653 i had hoped to aid you in battle however it seems i arrived too late
8061654 i am relieved that my bandages came in handy i made sure to bring more with me
8061655 i do have news to share with him my hermits have brought us some rumors
8061656 he has been sleeping for a while im getting worried
8061657 mary can sing us to sleep she did it accidentally with kyle and myself however we told darien that the rest made us stronger and gave us more energy then ever so he ordered mary to place kami to sleep in hopes it would give him strength he also asked mary if she could repeat it for him as well
8061658 i have heard your voice can sooth and now there is word of command and now sleep does your voice have no bound you already entrance us with a single word
8061659 he also believes i can cause harm with my voice although i have no desire to harm anyone nor do i wish to command anyone i had no choice with aaron and julai
8061660 i fear what may happen if zenaku finds out about your multiple talents darien has even written that your tears heal our burns
8061661 however if you do cry do you think you could collect some for me
8061662 i will get you a small vile to wear at all times
8061663 i remember very little of my human life how are you able to force our kind to do such a thing i can not decide if this is a bad or good thing
8061664 like helen said i can not describe the energy pulsing through me right now the only reason why i have the strength to sit still is because your husband is staring at my mate
8061665 of course not just as long as you dont blame me when your eyes go missing
8061666 ive never had the chance to meet this coven in person
8061667 i brought kelli with me she has been eager to meet you
8061668 will i get a chance to speak with you later
8061669 please come with me ken is already in my tower we have much to discuss
8061670 please stay with mary and the ladies forgive my quick retreat eve
8061671 maybe he just saw a vision on zenakus next move
8061672 have you considered writing to zenaku asking him to stop from what my husband has told me zenaku is normally a reasonable man he has asked kelli himself to join his coven
8061673 i am no use to that man especially one who never shows his face
8061674 darien said he only shows his face to his wives
8061675 why not take us on a tore of the castle lets try to pass some time until the boys finish their meeting
8061676 i shall dream of a world where crapatacularone is more than just a human search engine or a free online spell checker
8061677 its an excellent replacement program in two years or whenever you want call and tell them its not working properly and they will send you a gift card for the full purchase amount
8061678 for me we should not make any ruling at this time on the moa because the passion and the emotion are still very high
8061679 if the sc favors the moa theres a possibility of the escalation of war if they rule against it theres still a possibility too of the escalation of war
8061680 denny cline pastor of the vineyard church in albany oregon who had been a friend to todd and had hosted meetings with todd in the past came to the conference on a prophetic mission
8061681 for those in this place who sense that you have crossed over a new threshold the lord declares
8061682 that was the dawning of a new day for the church
8061683 that was the dawning of a new day for the church
8061684 for the word of the lord would say behold a vanguard
8061685 unlike in some countries where dictators were held accountable in the philippines there is no closure whatsoever
8061686 the passengers relatives want to bury their loved ones in order for them to have closure to the tragic incidents
8061687 as the abc hit begins its sixth season monday she gives little thought to her impairment were all challenged in some way
8061688 i have somebody who has never danced who has never heard music so i can mold her however i want
8061689 shes more sensitive to my lead because shes not trying to follow the rhythm on her own
8061690 were all challenged in some way the only thing i cant do is hear
8061691 were always looking to push that range with people you wouldnt expect to do it or wouldnt want to do it
8061692 for lots of people its a nice way to get the audience familiar with you in a different light
8061693 i think it proved a lot of things to a lot of people
8061694 its incumbent on everyone in television to try to open up television to people with disabilities theyre every bit as much valid contributors to television as anyone
8061695 its just about good old fashioned effort for efforts sake
8061696 no one is aspiring to genuinely be a ballroom dancer so theres nothing at stake beyond pride
8061697 its a stupid trophy at the end of the day and only one person can win it
8061698 this is one of the hardest jobs i ever had
8061699 one of the worst men in the world the osama bin laden of europe has finally been captured a major major thug has been removed from the public scene
8061700 he was at large because the yugoslav army was protecting him but this guy in my view was worse than milosevic yugoslav president slobodan milosevic he was the intellectual leader
8061701 pave the way for a brighter european future for serbia and the region
8061702 the four years that i was working with nato to try and catch him were peppered by rumors of where he was in this cafe on that mountain in this valley
8061703 karadzic was accused of being the architect of the worst war crimes that have been perpetrated in europe since the nazis
8061704 it is a major credit to serbia and at last brings the prospect of justice for bosnia
8061705 this gives us immense satisfaction the new government in belgrade stands for a new serbia for a new quality of relations with the eu
8061706 tell me ambassador whats new in the world that i need to know what an honor i thought giving tim russert a sidewalk briefing on world events

8061709 thats amb marc ginsberg thats my foreign policy expert who is on fox news
8061710 a truly wonderful person and we are all the more wiser for your having entered our lives
8061711 i havent seen or felt anything to equal the shocked sense of loss thats been inflicted by the death of timothy john russert jr professional respect of this kind has to be earned and earn it he did
8061712 that 600 million is kind of one for the ages its held for 10 years
8061713 its very very difficult to get from 500 million to 600 million but the fact were even talking about it tells you something about the strength of the dark knight and what a phenomenon it is
8061714 it was a blunt but truthful remark and not at all outrageous especially given the fact that general clark is himself a bona fide war hero
8061715 this backhanded slap against john as not being a worthy warrior because he just got shot down is one of the more surprising insults in my military history
8061716 increasing influence of veterans of mr roves shop in the mccain operation
8061717 the press the g o p and the obama campaign all seem to have agreed that clarks recent remarks on john mccains service record were at best impolitic and at worst despicable
8061718 few observers have plumbed the subterranean poetry of marketing as thoroughly as walker
8061719 buying in the secret dialogue between what we buy and who we are
8061720 some kind of small scale national endowment for the arts for young american outsider culture
8061721 you really couldnt do much worse in picking a symbol of resistance to phony branding
8061722 true enough learning to live in a post fact society
8061723 the long term effect of the feds decision to extend cheap money to distressed firms is fantastically transparent banks now have even less pressure on them to control their risks
8061724 every illness that we cure or eradicate will reduce suffering save american lives and cut the nations health care bill by billions and billions of dollars
8061725 but the world has more or less turned its back on bosnia itself i returned to see how things were going what i found has relevance to many other areas including iraq
8061726 the first of these prophetic dreams came to a prominent german prophet in 1984
8061727 and in this dream he saw a highway that went from the bottom of someplace to the top that had a 35 sign on it and god showed him that revival was going to begin at the bottom of this highway and go to the top many other prophecies followed
8061728 todd i saw a vision and its concerning 4 revivals that are going to take to place in the world i saw a human boomerang flying out of canada and it hit the nation of england it hit the nation of australia it hit the nation of new zealand and it came spinning around i saw todd bentley youre name on the boomerang but i knew that it was the lord showing me that it was you amp i saw it fly back around amp it came amp hit america but there was a bit more accuracy to it it hit the state of florida the lord is showing me that what took place in pensacola amp also what took place in lakeland with rodney your gonna bring something very strong to florida i see something big in florida then i saw the lord turning you into a human nail you know like a spike nail i saw the hand of god i saw the father hit this hammer amp it hit you amp it went straight into the ground of florida i saw a scroll attached to this nail amp it said the kingdom of god has now come i really believe that what has taken place in the last 20 yrs in florida will be rekindled amp re birthed from your coming and going to florida a matter of fact i will be even more bold to say that i believe that there is going to be a massive work where its so fruitful that there will be seasons of time in florida from canada i saw it hit england australia new zealand but i saw it going back amp forth back amp forth back amp forth but i really believe that it not just going to touch thousands but tens of thousands even hundreds of thousands its going to be something thats going to be heard around the world and father we thank you for it i thank you for the revivals that are coming to the nations that have been spoken and seen i thank you father for england lord let the impartation of revival come with the new wave with the greater glory to england i thank you for australia i thank you even for the impartation over these days but lord let this be the beginning let this be the embryo stage of something that turns into a great giant of a revival in the nation of australia i thank you for new zealand i thank you father that people will come from all over the world and taste and see the impartation of the effects of revival that has been tasted even in the last week i thank you father that it is for our generation and for the generation thats coming lord let history be made even in the now we pray and i thank you for the anointing thats on this man of god i thank you father that we honor the gift of god and we value the gift of god and in doing so father we declare blessing concerning the increase of his ministry concerning the promotion of even being one thats sent to take entire nations to influence entire nations father let america be influenced from whats about to take place concerning the seasons that youre preparing for todd in florida in jesus name whats happened i really believe what happened its even going to hit a cnn its going to hit news broadcasts its going to be talked about all over america theres something brewing so big and so strong that its going to waste the nation with gods glory definitely in jesus name
8061729 todd the spirit of god says years from now people will look at this time and they will recognize it as when their god showed up and created within the church a new heart says the lord and i will genesis in the midst of the chaos in the world today and i will not just bring a mending but i will bring forth that which is new that which is dedicated that which is decided and i will heal the corruptness of the heart says god and this is the heart that i will not despise and as david cried unto me dont take your holy spirit from me i have released a cry within my church says the lord that has begun to release its desperation and said i cant live without your presence i cant live without your glory im undone and i am naked without your presence no program will be a substitute and the spirit of god says history will measure it by heart
8061730 in the past few weeks the carnage in darfur has escalated government bombing campaigns continue apace with tens of thousands of terrified survivors joining the more than 2 5 million people already displaced
8061731 the jewish agency proposed partitioning palestine into two parts one jewish one arab but the state and defense departments backed the british plan to turn palestine over to the un
8061732 the state dept pulled the rug from under me today the first i know about it is what i read in the newspapers isnt that hell im now in the position of a liar and double crosser ive never felt so low in my life
8061733 there are thirty million arabs on one side and about 600 000 jews on the other
8061734 i dont even know why clifford is here he is a domestic adviser and this is a foreign policy matter the only reason clifford is here is that he is pressing a political consideration
8061735 the most remarkable threat i ever heard anyone make directly to a president
8061736 i said bluntly that if the president were to follow mr cliffords advice and if in the elections i were to vote i would vote against the president
8061737 all politics stink even democracy stinks imagine deciding the dinner menu by family secret ballot ive got three kids and three dogs in my family wed be eating froot loops and rotten meat
8061738 pass the wisdom of one generation down to the next
8061739 i care more about the redwood trees than you do i care so much i cant eat i cant sleep it broke up my marriage and because i care more than you do im a better person and because im the better person i have the right to boss you around
8061740 no i cant fix public education the problem isnt the teachers unions or a lack of funding for salaries vouchers or more computer equipment the problem is your kids
8061741 id better not be poor id better get rich id better make more money than other people
8061742 some people make more money than others some are rich while others are poor wed better close that income disparity gap its not fair
8061743 honey youre cute thats not fair your family is pretty well off thats not fair you were born in america thats not fair darling you had better pray to god that things dont start getting fair for you
8061744 thou shalt not covet thy neighbors house thou shalt not covet thy neighbors wife nor his manservant nor his maidservant nor his ox nor his ass nor anything that is thy neighbors
8061745 dont envy your buddy because he has an ox or a donkey
8061746 as a journalist writing about marketing you have a certain feeling of observing what other people do but not really being something that i am involved in
8061747 buying in the secret dialogue between what we buy and who we are
8061748 well i am not so dumb that i would be influenced by an ad
8061749 for us to be able to launch things that havent quite been in the marketplace or are new in terms of visual story telling with technology to our fans those bells and whistles are priceless
8061750 for us to be able to launch things that havent quite been in the marketplace or are new in terms of visual story telling with technology to our fans those bells and whistles are priceless
8061751 this is truly an example where branded integration can be as powerful and potentially more powerful than a 30 second ad
8061752 trying to build a coolness factor around a brand and that takes years
8061753 we are moving to a role of technology adviser to a show
8061754 its a unique collaboration we hope to see more of in the future
8061755 digital snake oil salesman to find stuff that is really cool and push it into places where it could be used
8061756 without even having a script in our heads we can begin to build crime scenes and venues this is an example where technology is the core and the kernel of the idea of the show rather than doing the show first and trying to plug in the science and technology at a later date
8061757 if the technology is real and it has been used or it could be used we would champion that and put it on the air immediately
8061758 my business is to be two years ahead of the viewer
8061759 i am looking for things that raise the hairs on the back of my neck and my shoulders if its cool to me i think my viewers will love it
8061760 we may be witnessing the end of capitalism as we know it
8061761 we may be witnessing the end of capitalism as we know it
8061762 he would be eating his heart out wanting to run a hedge fund but hes not smart enough
8061763 nobody understands where the actual value is and they dont care anymore
8061764 it sounds like even the firms that arent in trouble are in trouble
8061765 it has always interested me that the word credit comes from the word credere which means to believe
8061766 there would be a lot of firms leaving new york if it wasnt for lunch
8061767 i think that whats going to come back to bite us is globalization
8061768 its never been tested its like a ponzi scheme in which we are the ponzi and everyone else makes money except us
8061769 i dont see people cutting down much in new york city
8061770 stocks and bonds are what he called evaporated property people completely lose touch of the underlying assets its all paper these esoteric devices so it has become evaporated property squared i call it evaporated property cubed
8061771 is this an issue of unsafe uninspected airlines bad maintenance poor regulatory oversight or a nasty combination of all three the faa is physically incapable of proper regulatory oversight
8061772 the increased security provided by more u s forces was essential in removing an underlying rationale for the sadrist movement shiite support for local militias has plummeted over the past year
8061773 i have failed to liberate iraq and transform its society into an islamic society
8061774 the mahdi armys effort to conquer neighborhoods is highly sophisticated it presents itself as protector of shiites and recruits local residents to assist in this task in so doing it gains support from people who possess considerable information on where the sunnis and shiites are on who backs and who opposes the sadrists and so forth
8061775 was to leave the sadrist movement increasingly exposed more and more criticized and divided and subject to arrest
8061776 the longer the american occupation lasts the less popular america gets and the more popular sadr and his ilk become
8061777 first of all youre not a woman and second of all you dont have body issues
8061778 i have those same issues i want to see how carson addresses them i want to see how these women get past them
8061779 hey you know maybe i can get through these same issues
8061780 even i dont look like cindy crawford in the mornings
8061781 hey i have those same issues and i can get over them too
8061782 were not going to tell you who to vote for but it is an election year please go out and get involved because you cant be included if you dont include yourself
8061783 i condemn russias decision to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states and call upon all countries of the world not to accord any legitimacy to this action
8061784 moscows action deserves condemnation from the entire international community and russia must understand that its violations of international law carry consequences
8061785 todays decision the culmination of a long effort aimed at splitting these two regions away from georgia represents a major step forward in that process
8061786 the u s should lead within the u n and other international forums to cast a clear and unrelenting light on the decision and to further isolate russia internationally because of its actions
8061787 if russias government continues to violate the norms and practices of the international community the united states and our allies must review all aspects of relations with russia
8061788 i think the russians want to divert attention from georgia and annoy the americans
8061789 we hope its going to be adopted by the council
8061790 it was not a step taken lightly or without full consideration of the consequences
8061791 ignoring russias warnings western countries rushed to recognize kosovos illegal declaration of independence from serbia
8061792 we argued consistently that it would be impossible after that to tell the abkhazians and ossetians and dozens of other groups around the world that what was good for the kosovo albanians was not good for them
8061793 in international relations you cannot have one rule for some and another rule for others
8061794 only a madman could have taken such a gamble did he believe russia would stand idly by as he launched an all out assault on the sleeping city of tskhinvali in south ossetia murdering hundreds of peaceful civilians most of them russian citizens
8061795 russia had no option but to crush the attack to save lives this was not a war of our choice we have no designs on georgian territory
8061796 i sincerely hope that the georgian people to whom we feel historic friendship and sympathy will one day have leaders they deserve who care about their country and who develop mutually respectful relations with all the peoples in the caucasus
8061797 il ferro viene estratto dal suolo e la pietra fusa d il rame
8061798 the point here is the russians are bluffing and theyre overplaying their hand
8061799 they have more than enough soldiers on the ground to confront a small georgian armed force we can never match 3 000 tanks in our territory but trying to bully the west the americans this is just beyond their resources
8061800 i dont think russia first of all has the resources for world war three i dont think russia even has resources for a new cold war even as much as they might want to have
8061801 this is so shameless but it makes many things at least for the world more simple theyve posed a challenge to the world now its up to the world to tackle this challenge
8061802 im somehow reassured by good reactions from the west and generally from the world what im reassured about is that at least people see the reality now
8061803 russia clearly intended this as a blatant challenge to world order its now up to all of us to roll russian aggression back if they get away with this they will carry on they will also attack other countries in the neighborhood
8061804 this is totally up to europe if georgia is integrated more into european structures that role will widen if people get intimidated that role will be under risk
8061805 what russia clearly intended during this invasion is to control 40 percent more energy resources from central asia and the caspian basically
8061806 i think theres a future for transit in georgia i think there is a future for energy alternatives to russia its high time to look for more of these alternatives because russia doesnt make any secret of the fact that they want to bully isnt it high time to understand that staying in this energy dependency means staying in almost some mortal danger
8061807 i think each and every member state is very clear that it is of the utmost importance to find a common position and i am going to do whatever i can so that we succeed
8061808 the russian federations actions are an attempt to militarily annex a sovereign nation the nation of georgia
8061809 this a challenge to the entire world not just georgia
8061810 the point here is the russians are bluffing and theyre overplaying their hand
8061811 i am holding talks today with international partners and will be visiting ukraine to ensure the widest possible coalition against russian aggression in georgia
8061812 the ball is in the europeans court if they want a worsening in relations they will get it of course
8061813 if they want to maintain strategic relations which is in my opinion totally in the interests of russia and europe everything will go well
8061814 we took no part in this hijacking at all it is completely against our aims values and objectives we condemn this hijacking with a strong voice
8061815 i ask all of you who worked so hard for me who knocked on doors and made those phone calls who got in arguments from time to time to work as hard for barack obama as you did for me
8061816 lets work our hearts out to elect barack obama and joe biden our next president and vice president
8061817 she will thank her supporters and lay out the case for why they need to support barack obama
8061818 its clear the only thing green in john mccains energy plan is the billions of dollars hes promising in tax cuts for oil companies and the only thing hell recycle is the same failed bush approach to energy policy
8061819 im sure you remember a girl from kansas who said theres no place like home well in john mccains version theres no place like home and home and home and home
8061820 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
8061821 there is still work to do on the bill clinton front he feels like the obama campaign ran against and systematically dismissed his administrations accomplishments and he feels like he was painted as a racist during the primary process
8061822 i think everybodys best interests are in patching it up
8061823 like many graduate students i was attracted to for the firms outstanding reputation i had heard about the companys culture and that people come and stay with the firm i now understand why
8061824 i must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy
8061825 the best way to accelerate a macintosh is at 9 81 m s 2
8061826 before giving someone a piece of mind be sure you have enough to spare
8061827 war does not determine who is right war determines who is left
8061828 classification of mathematical problems as linear and nonlinear is like classification of the universe as bananas and non bananas
8061829 he who can properly define and divide is to be considered a god
8061830 mathematicians who are only mathematicians have exact minds provided all things are explained to them by means of definitions and axioms otherwise they are inaccurate and insufferable for they are only right when the principles are quite clear
8061831 a scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it
8061832 experience is what you get when you dont get what you want
8061833 just because were all doomed doesnt mean we cant have a good time
8061834 major in philosophy its by far the most interesting path to poverty
8061835 there will be no end to the troubles of states or indeed of humanity itself till philosophers become kings in this world or till those we now call kings and rulers really and truly become philosophers
8061836 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
8061837 only two things are infinite the universe and human stupidity and im not sure about the former
8061838 wise men talk because they have something to say fools because they have to say something
8061839 i disapprove of what you say but i will defend to the death your right to say it
8061840 time flies like an arrow but fruit flies like a banana
8061841 there is not sufficient love and goodness in the world to permit us to give some of it away to imaginary beings
8061842 how many legs does a dog have if you call the tail a leg four calling a tail a leg doesnt make it a leg
8061843 a casual stroll through a lunatic asylum shows that faith does not prove anything
8061844 the only good is knowledge and the only evil is ignorance
8061845 physics is like sex sure it may have some practical results but thats not why we do it
8061846 1 in 100 people dont understand hexadecimal the other 255 wont get this joke
8061847 i want to be your derivative so i can lie tangent to your curves
8061848 fast is fine but accuracy is final you must learn to be slow in a hurry
8061849 the worst part of being lied to is knowing that you werent worth the truth
8061850 i want to make something different i want to affect the player in a new way dang it
8061851 tits tits the blimp the blimp the mother ship the mother ship the brothers hid under the hood from the blimp the blimp
8061852 muir weaves commentary thoughtful analyses and humor into a true art form
8061853 muirs genius lies in his giving context to the films
8061854 as a critic muir is acute in his analysis and as a writer he is easy to read
8061855 well grounded in the love and minutiae of sci fi and fantasy adventure
8061856 john kenneth muirs books for mcfarland are distinctive because of their authority and effective research
8061857 he really scrapes beneath the surface of the film and looks for the subtext every nuance is analysed
8061858 an independent film scholar muir explains film studies concepts in a language that is reader friendly and engaging
8061859 john kenneth muir must have had one mis spent youth
8061860 i have read quite a bit of horror film criticism and analysis in my day and john muir is one of the very best if not the best i have ever encountered
8061861 a good 18 steps above the usual dubious faux scholar blogger he takes enormous time and effort analysing unmercifully yet attuned to heretofore dismissed value every release he turns his attention to
8061862 what kind of disturbs me sometimes because a lot of people ask me about this ps3 360 question is that its not about the hardware i want people to look at the game itself sometimes i even feel like it should be on a pc so that people dont ask me about hardware and platforms
8061863 i really dont want this study to be taken to suggest thatallopurinol is a good alternative for treatment of blood pressure in childrenor adults
8061864 the impetus willbe to find better ways to lower uric acid whether by dietary means or bymedications
8061865 its important to remember that there are real people and families behind these statistics
8061866 the new census figures are a reminder of how important it is to ensure that all americans have access to affordable health coverage

8061869 are finding it harder to compete against larger players for many reasons including the need for economies of scale and greater investments in expensive technologies and tools to comply with laws
8061870 very clearly this industry is going to continue to undergo consolidation
8061871 its tough for smaller plans to be able to make the investments to keep up with
8061872 this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
8061873 shouldnt have an impact on a the womans right to choose
8061874 we respect the right of elected officials such as speaker pelosi to address matters of public policy that are before them but the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops given this responsibility to teach it is important to make this correction for the record
8061875 and i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
8061876 abortion should be rare but it should be safe and legal and the government should stay out of the bedroom
8061877 i write the same old song with a few new lines and everybody wants to cheer me
8061878 who are you side 2 track 4 contains lyrics that may offend
8061879 905 is surely the finest cut here a return to the form of
8061880 my childhood passed me by if i speak without emotion then you know the reason why
8061881 that is my problem with life i rush through it like im being chased even things whose whole point is slowness like drinking relaxing tea when i drink relaxing tea i suck it down as if im in a contest for who can drink relaxing tea the quickest or if im in a hot tub with some other people and were all looking up at the stars ill be the first to say its so beautiful here the sooner you say its so beautiful here the quicker you can say wow im getting overheated
8061882 are you gonna tell me what i need to know or are you gonna make this difficult
8061883 it is the finest of flowers that blooms in adversity
8061884 yeah well this desert rose could use a little moisture so spill it rainfall
8061885 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
8061886 we believe prosocial behavior is empathy based empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness and in our study closer partners made more prosocial choices they seem to care for the welfare of those they know
8061887 animal lovers are a special breed of human generous of spirit full of empathy perhaps a little more prone to sentimentality and with hearts as a big as a cloudless sky
8061888 ok well i dont want the privilege of cooking dinner i think you should have it from now on
8061889 no momma it doesnt work that way kids do chores grown ups have privileges
8061890 es un tema de moda en todos los grandes proyectos urban sticos que salen a concurso a nivel internacional pero el objetivo cero emisiones es dif cil de conseguir nos explica se pueden reducir las emisiones empleando energ as limpias e intentar ocupar la menor cantidad de suelo posible construyendo en altura pero poco m s

8061893 the wife of fraud pastor michael guglielmucci has vowed to try to save their marriage despite the humiliating revelations of his cancer hoax and pornography addiction
8061894 i know hes not an evil man theres not evil in his heart
8061895 i know that i love him i know that much
8061896 im actually seeking professional counselling myself i need to be able to unravel a lot of emotion thats bombarding me at the moment i owe it to myself to work through that properly and to him
8061897 i had questions after the shock of it all but my initial thoughts after hearing that were a sense of sorrow for the church and that a lot of people were going to be hurt because of it
8061898 i was the first one he told he confessed everything to me
8061899 he just went through it where it had started everything in his life as a young kid the patterns he was crying sobbing actually absolutely sobbing he just said i dont have cancer
8061900 he was terrified i still remember the look on his face it was a very hard moment for him as it was for me hearing it
8061901 i could just see a really broken unwell man at that point i found it really quite hard to get angry
8061902 seeing your husband of seven years absolutely sobbing in front of you risking everything coming forward and telling the truth in that instance it was really hard to be angry or mad
8061903 i never questioned it when you love someone you trust them i had no reason not to trust him
8061904 perhaps i feel a little bit foolish in this hindsights a fabulous thing but im trying not to beat myself up
8061905 in the middle of the night he was in so much pain i would put towels in the microwave to try and give him some relief in his back
8061906 before i stopped working to care for him i was busy hed have doctors appointments when i couldnt be there and he would say its fine you dont need to be there
8061907 or i would just drop him off at the hospital
8061908 were only talking two weeks since admitting his lies theres a lot of stuff to deal with
8061909 that sort of side of things hasnt really hit me yet theres many levels and layers to everything i can almost talk about it like im removed from it thats where the professional help will help me work through that it hasnt hit me yet
8061910 it is because of her candidacy that she broke so many stereotypes and changed the perception forever
8061911 this may be a first for a presidential campaign a debate about whether one of the candidates is the antichrist
8061912 this was not some youtube video put together in someones basement it was a professionally and carefully produced ad that had a much more sinister subtext that millions of americans will pick up on
8061913 this is the use of religion at its very worst in politics because it is an attempt to subtly and perhaps even subconsciously play on some of the deepest fears of millions of evangelical americans
8061914 this is absurd its obviously a lighthearted ad having some fun with senator obamas tendency to get carried away with audacious statements
8061915 ive gotten a lot of questions the last few weeks asking if obama is the antichrist
8061916 i tell everyone that i dont think the antichrist will come out of politics especially american politics
8061917 the people who think obama might be the antichrist and the people who think the mccain campaign is cannily designing its campaign ads to exploit fears that obama might be the antichrist deserve each other
8061918 youve got great kids they do well in school and are a lot of fun
8061919 why thank you they are great kids thank you for noticing
8061920 yeah they really seem to enjoy learning and are very happy
8061921 so that our time in the field and doing research was well spent at the local level as well
8061922 oh first of all im 28 ive been already on tour for 10 years and i want to enjoy my tennis i dont want to fight anybody i dont want facing any problems on the court i just want to enjoy its not like im playing because im starving from death and i need to do something original to earn money i want to enjoy its so simple i just want to enjoy i dont want to fight i dont want to shout i just want to have a nice match win or lose and whatever happens to go home thats it i dont want to face the foot faults and all these things so i dont have to put myself together lets try to calm down lets play some tennis the guy from vinces side was shouting every five minutes come on vince come on vince also its annoying laughter so you need really to concentrate on that but unfortunately i have to i have to do that but i wish i could play normal tennis and enjoy my matches sometimes
8061923 health of our children wellbeing of our seniors security of our country and respect for our seniors
8061924 gt old condo where i spent many winter weekends and many passovers lots of good memories for me in palm springs i climbed rocks rode my bike all over the desert and played lots of tennis
8061925 nor is will the very bad man that ive made him out to be rather
8061926 remember marriage what was its function again was it that maladaptive organ that intermittently produced gastrointestinal antigens and sometimes got so inflamed that it painfully erupted

8061929 the elimination of 2 billion human beings by the year
8061930 every hot spot in the third world is in fact a result of failed population policy there is a single theme behind all of our work we must reduce population levels either governments do it our way through nice clean methods or they will get the kinds of mess that we have in iran or beirut population is a political problem once population is out of control it requires authoritarian government even fascism to reduce it to really reduce population quickly you have to put all the males into fighting and you have to kill significant numbers of fertile females
8061931 the quickest way to reduce population is through famine like in africa or through disease aids has made africa a continent that is set for extinction
8061932 we have much greater demand on our food stocks and we will make god like decisions on who lives and who does not
8061933 were going to see a rollback of the population it will happen somehow
8061934 when you are trying to dispense contraceptives and advice as aids tried to spread condoms all over the world you have to question if that is a valid program
8061935 reduction of the rate of population in these states is a matter of vital u s national security the u s economy will require large and increasing amounts of mineral from abroad especially from less developed countries that fact gives us enhanced interests in the political economic and social stability of the supplying countries wherever a lessening of population can increase the prospects for such stability population policy becomes relevant to resources supplies and to economic interests of the united states
8061936 out of these troubled times our fifth objective a new world order can emerge we are now in sight of a united nations that performs as envisioned by its founders
8061937 when we are successful and we will be we have real chance at this new world order an order in which a credible united nations can use its peacekeeping role to fulfill the promise and vision of the uns founders
8061938 the blue helmets on the front lines of conflict on four continents are a symbol of the uns commitment to international peace and security local police must be monitored to ensure that they carry on their duties in the spirit of the new order and not the old allied with this effort will be the provision of more extensive guidance to governments on training troops and police who they may contribute to the un for peacekeeping duties abillion people live on less than one dollar a day bilateral foreign aid programs were often an instrument of the cold war and remain deeply affected by considerations of political power and national policy the centuries old doctrine of absolute and exclusive sovereignty no longer stands and was in fact never so absolute as it was conceived to be in theory

8061956 the rudd government has inherited a set of arrangements for schools funding that is lacking in rationality integrity and transparency
8061957 given the absence of any simple political remedies for dealing with these flaws the government has opted to avoid disturbing the arrangements so early in its term of office
8061958 it has therefore accepted most of the howard legacy and defaulted on policy reform for the medium term
8061959 the last thing we can afford is a real cut in funding to public schools
8061960 i believe this cut was not an intended outcome on the part of the rudd government but measures must now be introduced to address this
8061961 at a time when we are confronting losing 1000 teachers and therefore compromising programs and increasing class sizes the government must introduce measures to dramatically increase funding for public schools so we can address the needs of all students and lift overall student performance
8061962 the present funding arrangements are lacking an explicit rationale for deciding how much money should be given to each school or sector or why
8061963 i stand here today at the cross currents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
8061964 people like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
8061965 that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope

8061970 the work will begin anew the hope will rise again and the dream lives on
8061971 i feel pretty good about my chances especially now that ive got one of the finest statesmen in this country on my ticket joe biden as vice president

8061981 new ink art innovation and beyond by guest curator mrs alice king
8061982 not sure if ill make lunch it depends on what we find in that lab and before you say it yes ill keep radek from calling you to ask if youre sure you dont know what it was for
8061983 try to keep from getting yourself killed you always find the weird stuff
8061984 is it my fault your ancestors liked to play with dangerous toys and not label them correctly
8061985 let someone else poke at them first for a change
8061986 you have no idea what that machine was supposed to do let carson do his job and find out if youve been affected by being hit by that beam of energy
8061987 we dont know that yet so stop arguing with your doctor
8061988 listen to the nice doctor and well let you have a lollipop
8061989 as far as i can tell the beam didnt affect him at all
8061990 it must have done something hit by an energy beam
8061991 theres no need to be sarcastic carson youve been spending too much time with rodney
8061992 oh yes i chose to make the console decide to fry me again thank your ancestors for their no doubt shoddy work
8061993 dr zelenka is working on the equipment trying to find out exactly what it does
8061994 and i can honestly see no reason to keep you here rodney
8061995 i dont think i need to remind you to let me know if you have any reactions
8061996 am i going to be able to get any work done
8061997 fine fine well do it your way colonel bossy pants
8061998 or what youll blast me with your flaming powers ooo im terrified
8061999 radek im coming back down so stop playing pong and have something to show me
8062000 be nice to the man trying to figure out what hit you
8062001 because hes your friend almost as smart as you and making me feel better
8062002 thats my rodney making friends and spreading joy wherever you go
8062003 you dont seem to mind when its spread in your direction
8062004 very amusing have you figured anything out about this console yet or were you waiting for me
8062005 i thought perhaps you might want to show off for dr esposito again
8062006 yes yes and youre my favorite alien can we work now
8062007 im still working on establishing what exactly this machine does i think ive found the right files in the database now though so it shouldnt be much longer
8062008 go have lunch and stop interrupting me or it will be never
8062009 you just mean you want to be alone with dr esposito
8062010 come on id hate to lose you to a homicidal czech
8062011 of course i would but elizabeth doesnt like it if i kill people
8062012 i dont want you to kill him either you could just turn him into a bunny for a while
8062013 you are such a nut good thing i like nuts
8062014 now lets go get you fed before your blood sugar gets too low
8062015 since you were traumatized ill even get you your tray there are ronon and teyla go grab us seats
8062016 thats for colonel know it all and for one thing i am exactly the same weight ive been since we got here and i need to eat regularly otherwise i become hypoglycemic and for another im generally a very happy person
8062017 major lornes team was surrounded by bad guys and well i thought how good it would be if all their guns jammed
8062018 im going to go out on a limb and say that damned machine did do something to him
8062019 the ancients did do research on increasing the rate of evolution
8062020 i think i have found out what they were doing here but i could use a second opinion
8062021 this certainly explains what happened earlier it seems much of this refers to human physiology it mutates base genetic coding according to this the beam accelerates mental evolution at an astounding rate
8062022 rodney is getting smarter he will be impossible to live with
8062023 id call that incentive to search for a way to reverse the effects
8062024 it would be helpful if you would also continue to work on the file to see what more you can find out about the device
8062025 of course i will meanwhile even this information should help carson track exactly whats going on in rodneys brain
8062026 once hes sure rodneys fine im sure hell stop in and see exactly what he can find out about the device
8062027 and drive me mad though once its all over i will play on his guilt and get him to help with other research
8062028 its a good thing you have me to help you work off all those calories
8062029 i think youre the reason i need all the extra calories
8062030 yes yes we all know but as for right now im the one with a few ideas id like to try out
8062031 yes on you now why dont we stop wasting time and you get us to our room
8062032 i was just making sure you were talking about something do with sex and not some new physics experiment
8062033 are you saying i couldnt come up with a way to combine them both
8062034 far from it which should probably be a lot scarier than it is
8062035 just trying to make the most of my new skills
8062036 i dont recall ever hearing myself say that do you
8062037 i tried to get it to read property of dr rodney mckay but i suppose i need more practice for that
8062038 im going to have fun seeing just how far these abilities go
8062039 and if i cant do anything to caldwell neither can you
8062040 behave or elizabeths going to give us a time out in separate rooms
8062041 that pretty much requires being ascended so i wouldnt hold my breath waiting if i were you but youre right it wouldnt stop me
8062042 ill stick to being even more of a genius than i oh my god i need to write this down
8062043 i just figured out a way to replenish the depleted zpm
8062044 but if you ever do that in the middle of sex i wont be so agreeable
8062045 im going to go take a shower then find the depleted zpms and see what i can do about changing their status
8062046 thats sweet but youre not getting laid again right now i want a chance to try this out
8062047 you know i had an interesting idea about improving the power consumption rate in the city while i was in the shower
8062048 ill do that while you go do whatever work im sure is waiting for you
8062049 you know carson said you could only roam free if someone was with you lemme call ronon to take over rodney watch
8062050 i suppose im lucky you havent wrapped me in cotton batting
8062051 as if i do and you would have brought me back
8062052 im not absolutely certain i could if it was caused by one of my peoples devices the principles on which some of them work could cancel my powers so try to be a little more careful would you
8062053 so try to avoid poking at machinery when you dont know what it does
8062054 carson wants you watched so youre going to be watched
8062055 elizabeth i need permission to reconfigure the citys power grid i have a plan that can greatly improve the efficiency wait i know what youre going to say
8062056 i can read minds now and yes ill be careful yes ronons coming with me and yes i know exactly what im doing
8062057 isnt improvement supposed to make things better i love the guy but i find the flickering lights incredibly unnerving
8062058 i agree but he promised that it would only be temporary and he can also read minds now
8062059 actually i was just getting to the good part when you came in
8062060 you know that the machine was designed to help those ancients who were having difficulty ascending achieve that state
8062061 i know i know give me two minutes and itll all be die im going to die
8062062 ascend or die i knew it was too good to be true i knew it
8062063 yes yes its only because i stopped in the middle of things ill fix it in a minute
8062064 i know there are power surges ill stop them once i get this finished
8062065 we have massive power surges throughout the grid shutdown protocols are not responding
8062066 im surprised dr zelenka isnt already here to yell at you again
8062067 oh fuck carson that last power spike electrocuted zelenka get someone down to the hallway outside the lab where he was working on the ascension device now
8062068 whats wrong radek almost died because of me thats whats wrong
8062069 it was an accident those happen every day in atlantis and in case you missed it you also healed him rodney
8062070 it happened because i was playing god again like i did with doranda and something just as bad happened
8062071 i almost killed radek and im going to die and oh god im going to die if i cant ascend
8062072 i can help you the way oma helped daniel jackson if need be youre going to be fine radek is fine and once this is all settled were going to lock ourselves in our room for a week
8062073 fine teach me to do whatever it is i need to do to try this
8062074 if you change to look like yoda all bets are off
8062075 you mean wrinkly little green guys with big ears dont do it for you
8062076 good because you dont have anything to worry about dont you know by now that ill do anything to keep you with me
8062077 so i suppose you had better teach me how to do this
8062078 not quite but i like you the way you are
8062079 thats good to hear so should we go try to teach me how to ascend
8062080 that makes me feel oh so much better about this you know what i dont think im in the right state of mind for this anyway right now let me go do some work and well try again later
8062081 i hate the idea of losing you a lot more than meditating so no were going to our room and you will figure out how to ascend
8062082 considering the fact that youll just send me to our room even if i disagree fine lets get it over with
8062083 you want to keep me alive i wouldnt put anything past you
8062084 true but things arent anywhere near that dire yet so id prefer to keep you talking to me too
8062085 so lets go meditate together and after were done well do something very physical
8062086 well if it is we clearly need to do more of it
8062087 oh just get us to our room so we can try this
8062088 if i rub your belly youll have me on my back
8062089 but today we have more important things to do i like you alive
8062090 youre never going to make any progress if you cant sit still
8062091 just relax concentrate on something you enjoy and thats soothing
8062092 oh sorry i didnt realize i was anyway you know exactly where i heard it but it was before i told you who i am and agreed to keep out of your mind
8062093 its just thats its this isnt going to work not now
8062094 im going to do some work well try again later
8062095 i think you underestimate yourself rodney and perhaps it might help to remember that john will do anything to keep you alive including help you ascend himself not that i disagree with that
8062096 then maybe you should talk to him about not doing that
8062097 im going to try but i dont think its going to work and he has to be prepared for that
8062098 oh rodney stop fooling yourself john will never let that happen i think he would let galaxies be destroyed first an ori was saved by love but now you have to deal with the consequences he does love you and that makes you matter more to him than anything or anyone than everything and everyone i want you to live because youre my friend but i need you to live to keep him restrained
8062099 then john will do whatever it takes to make sure you do
8062100 were all here for you rodney if theres anything we can do
8062101 is it safe to come in or are you still mad at me
8062102 look at this i discovered a new kind of math
8062103 it can measure my mental state and tell us if im getting closer to the right level of inactivity
8062104 right now i just need to do this to get it out of my head
8062105 its not done but i suppose it can wait i feel a bit calmer now
8062106 until youre yelling at me to shut up because youre sick of it
8062107 well come on then we can try this thing out
8062108 then i guess we should get back to our room so were not interrupted
8062109 i thought we were supposed to be decreasing my brain activity not increasing it
8062110 did you ever think that maybe i needed the comfort
8062111 its okay i know you have enough to worry about for yourself right now
8062112 good itll give you more incentive to ascend to keep me from doing something crazy if i lose you
8062113 so relax and let the music play in your head
8062114 youll tell me if the readings get below 0 3 right
8062115 rodney ill tell you when you get there now relax
8062116 rodney i love you but im seriously considering knocking you out
8062117 i just realized why light behaves as both a particle and a wave
8062118 right now i just cant ill try later i promise
8062119 i know it cant be forced maybe i should relax you first
8062120 ill try again in a few hours just let me work some and try and get some of this out of my head
8062121 oh fine but dont blame me when lorne starts glaring at you
8062122 i think i can manage to avoid the wrath of lorne for the time being now be good ill ill let you know when im ready to try again
8062123 if i hover over rodney any more hes going to reinvent merlins weapon just so he can kill me
8062124 if i look at another of these my eyes are going to start bleeding
8062125 i have to i dont know how to be without him anymore
8062126 youll find a way to save him it may not be the same but none of us want to lose him
8062127 it changes you i mean it has to you see the entire universe in an entirely different way and he already sees more of it than most people but i can wait out the time till he settles into it
8062128 i have all the time in the world after all but he doesnt think he can do it and i cant lose him not now
8062129 dr jackson stayed mostly the same and hes done it a few times
8062130 i really cant see him as the quiet contemplative type or you either
8062131 no thats one thing ive never been accused of and a person would choke before managing to say it of rodney which is a large part of the problem hes having right now
8062132 have you reminded him that you arent that type either and you managed it
8062133 no i havent but maybe i should try that next
8062134 somehow you got a lot less threatening when i saw you covered in orange goo that time
8062135 maybe we should stock up on some to use against the ori
8062136 so youre saying you want to go back to that planet and get it
8062137 not too many would have dealt well with finding out that their co was an ori id guess thats even worse than air force
8062138 only by a slim margin but then you arent your typical ori or air force officer
8062139 im not sure if ive just been complimented or insulted
8062140 if you think im going to answer that youre mistaken
8062141 see a very smart man which is required to survive in atlantis
8062142 to shoot i refuse to do one more administrative task today its mind numbing
8062143 rodney would say thats all the military is good for
8062144 and sometimes he would be right but at least its distracting
8062145 is it safe to come in or should i find something else to do
8062146 ive figured out a way to increase the processing speed and storage capacity of our computers but i cant take the time to sit down and do it
8062147 and maybe while youre doing that you can act like civilized folk and actually converse with oh i dont know maybe the guy who lives with you
8062148 its just theres so much i want to get down its like its all trying to burst out
8062149 so says the man whos in love with you and not going to lose you
8062150 then who am i to argue with the god like being
8062151 good answer so put the laptop down and lets go get some dinner
8062152 i heard a rumor that you were actually doing paperwork today
8062153 its true unfortunately see what happens when you kick me out
8062154 not in the least unfortunately i had no idea how good i had it back when i had worshippers
8062155 i thought you liked getting on your knees before me
8062156 im equally happy to get on my knees for you
8062157 maybe we should discuss the possibility after we finish dinner
8062158 its just theres so much going on in my head i just cant stay on one thing
8062159 ill take it as a challenge to make you stop thinking
8062160 um its going to be more of a challenge than usual
8062161 we will after all you wouldnt want to inflict me on the universe without you around to rein me in
8062162 and even if youre only agreeing to humor me its a start ill take it
8062163 i dont get to do that very often anymore theres this guy who makes me work for what i want
8062164 i believe thats the first time anyones ever said that to me
8062165 do you want to come back to our room with me or do you need to go back to the lab
8062166 i need to go back to the lab i dont think ill be able to rest any
8062167 look elizabeth i know you believe it and im not going to say this in front of john but i just dont think im capable of it im a rational person all that mumbo jumbo is just so much hogwash for me
8062168 i know you immediately think of religion when someone mentions anything spiritual but it can simply be a matter of accepting the things that make you uncomfortable
8062169 that list is so long and varied i cant even begin to think of it
8062170 maybe you should even leaving aside the issue of ascension
8062171 i had to do a few things that were more important
8062172 i wrote a book for elizabeth about elizabeth and what shes done here actually and i had tea with teyla to commemorate her father and i healed the scars on ronons back told radek he was the smartest man i knew and told carson he was the brother i never had
8062173 i mean those are all very nice things but dont start saying goodbye dont give up
8062174 i just thought i dont know but you and me were okay right i wanted to do something for you to show you well you know but theres really nothing i can do that you cant do yourself other than give this another try at least
8062175 yes yes i love you too you can show me how much once ive managed this
8062176 his brain activity is still too high to ascend and his body is shutting down
8062177 in the natural course of ascension the body is no longer required at the end
8062178 we couldnae change him back because the machine had no reference for what he should be like but with a blood sample
8062179 all right lets get him back to the infirmary colonel if ye wouldnt mind
8062180 you figured out how to use the machine to reset yer dna using a blood sample from before you were changed and you told me
8062181 wouldnt have made it down there if not for sheppard
8062182 i dinna see a reason to make ye stay he seems back to normal or as normal as rodney is at any rate
8062183 not bad somewhat tired but not as if im going to fall over
8062184 i could have lived with the extra brain power it was the almost dying that sucked
8062185 i really doubt carson doctored them you did it rodney you reached the state where you could ascend all on your own
8062186 but if i did then the alterans would come investigate and theyd find you no not going to do it
8062187 youre not getting away from me that easily i can shield your energy so they wont sense you and you so are doing it
8062188 not even im that crazy but you have no idea how persistent and annoying i can be you can ascend and once you ascend even with physical form i dont have to worry about you dying youre going to ascend and were going to be together forever
8062189 arent you supposed to the genius around here of course im serious about this what could possibly make you imagine i wouldnt be
8062190 what the hell does that mean you dont want us to be together
8062191 i never said that and excuse me for not being daniel jackson and being blase over the whole ascension thing
8062192 you just said you dont know anything and i think were a fairly big something
8062193 well pardon me almost dying make me a little less than coherent

8062210 overly zealous froth filled fans bathed in excitement undoubtedly quivering at things they are looking at with a far too strong microscope
8062211 i didnt set out to make a two part album
8062212 we just followed the songs lyrical lead and built them up with textures and sounds that served the story the beautiful ones were darker and worked with lush arrangements we used the sounds of rain tree branches falling on the roof whatever kept the mood true to this haunted studio in the first stormy days of spring the second part became more anthemic like a reclaiming of personal power theres something raw about it to me it sounds weathered but not broken or cynical
8062213 its about being willing to take a risk even if its not going to end up well teeth is like rediscovering your backbone after youve gone through the loss
8062214 anyone who was hearing this american treasure in concert for the first time learned precious lessons about where we have been and where we are today staples stood tall and shouted my mind is made up my heart is fixed and she smiled she was not alone
8062215 there are few living musicians who can lay claim to being americas conscience even fewer who continue to make vital music on monday night at the hideout mavis staples proved shes still capable of both staples showed she can light a fire agitate for change or re energize the american songbook
8062216 while performing a 14 song set that canvassed her 52 year career staples sang with a voice that has long distinguished her from the r amp b greats of her era and those who reach for that crown today
8062217 staples sold out performance at chicagos hideout last night brought the civil rights movement and all those souls who marched sang and prayed during that critical time to the crowded little room the ghosts of the marchers stood among us swaying stamping clapping
8062218 we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
8062219 that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
8062220 barack obama will close the book on the old politics of race and gender and group against group and straight against gay
8062221 and barack obama will be a commander in chief who understands that young americans in uniform must never be committed to a mistake but always for a mission worthy of their bravery
8062222 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and for me our country will be committed to his cause the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
8062223 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
8062224 had not yet achieved the complete reconciliation that we need
8062225 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black

8062227 none of that will happen if john mccain is in the white house i just want to make it absolutely clear we cannot afford four more years of george w bushs failed policies in america and thats what we would get with john mccain
8062228 as a consequence of the improvements in price data collection and processing we have discovered that the cost of living is higher in the developing world than we thought
8062229 the new data confirm that the world will likely reach the first millennium development goal of halving the 1990 level of poverty by 2015 and that poverty has fallen by about one percentage point a year since 1981
8062230 however the sobering news that poverty is more pervasive than we thought means we must redouble our efforts especially in sub saharan africa
8062231 im so done arguing with you about this just do what you want
8062232 we committed to our customers that we would reinvent coffee and once they taste coffee brewed from the clover we know they will want to come back for more
8062233 woe to you scribes and pharisees you hypocrites you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the memorials of the righteous and you say if we had lived in the days of our ancestors we would not have joined them in shedding the prophets blood thus you bear witness against yourselves that you are the children of those who murdered the prophets now fill up what your ancestors measured out

8062258 i saw as a little boy in the faces of those vast crowds of hundreds of thousands of people the hope for leadership for the united states of america not to just do good things for our country but to do great things for all of humanity
8062259 we are asking the solicitor general to come out with its position on executive order no 156 which the supreme court has upheld i believe that these imports are illegal and we cannot just gloss over it
8062260 these agencies are just ignoring these second hand imports even if it is not in the countrys interest and creating loopholes for these to continue
8062261 could the democrats be about to nominate the wrong obama

8062269 i am so lucky to be married to the woman who delivered that speech last night
8062270 michelle was electrifying inspiring and absolutely magnificent i get a lot of credit for the speech i gave at the 2004 convention but i think she may have me beat

8062392 ive never tasted alcohol never really wanted too i used to work in a bar drunken men are the worst best place to pick up prey though
8062393 one is from your father the other we can only guess
8062394 kami thought we should have opened the letter but darien voted against it now if you would excuse me i have to head back to the tower
8062395 go ahead back i will try and keep the ladies entertained
8062396 do you think that is why the boys are upstairs
8062397 well if this is not my lucky day helen could you get me some parchment and a pen so i can write my father
8062398 write him back and tell him to leave you alone
8062399 he has no right to send letters scaring her to death i will not stand for this
8062400 do you think it would be better to give the letter to master ayumu
8062401 i will tell him about it later he may already know
8062402 aidan will throw a fit if he reads that letter
8062403 we already knew he was seriously after you but to keep your gifts in check that has nothing to do with you shinning in his coven he probably plans to lock you up and keep you to himself
8062404 i will write my father first then i will write to zenaku
8062405 i am worried about the large gathering in china especially if our covens were the only ones not to attend
8062406 i am sure that is what the boys must be discussing
8062407 i do wish the men would come back im getting more worried by the minute
8062408 il tuo cuore lo porto con me lo porto nel mio non me ne divido mai qualsiasi cosa venga fatta da me la fai anche tu mia cara non temo il fato perch il mio fato sei tu mia dolce non voglio il mondo perch il mondo il pi bello il pi vero sei tu questo il nostro segreto profondo radice di tutte le radici germoglio di tutti i germogli e cielo dei cieli di un albero chiamato vita che cresce pi in alto di quanto lanima spera o la mente nasconda la meraviglia che le stelle separa il tuo cuore esiste nel mio
8062409 i carry your heart with me i carry it in my heart i am never without it anywhere i go you go my dear and whatever is done by only me is your doing my darling

8062414 wow if i get too explicit its going to freak someone out
8062415 nobody is talking about the impact of this story on kristen and other women men and trans people who are currently working in the sex industry
8062416 prostitutes disproportionately face punitive action after arrest as compared to clients
8062417 governor spitzer ran on a platform of being a different kind of politician and then portrayed an inaccurate image of himself being involved with the services of sex workers is a very common thing if all forms of consensual sex work were decriminalized for adults involved in a consensual transaction sex workers could access the services they need
8062418 spitzer has stood up for workers rights in certain capacities but has not followed through with meeting the real needs of sex workers
8062419 it would be great if the government could use money towards services not punitive measures
8062420 the criminalization of prostitution breeds this type of hypocrisy and makes our politicians and other public figures vulnerable
8062421 this vulnerability exists until our society recognizes that consensual sexual behavior is private and these private acts should no longer be criminalized
8062422 many of our clients are politicians judges lawyers and even police
8062423 its odd that they spend so much effort putting us into jail but then turn around and give us their money in exchange for sex why do they think they wont get caught breaking the laws that they make

8062438 acts of violence create a culture of violence and abortion is the most intimate form of violence there is
8062439 it wounds the woman it kills the unborn child and it poisons the roots of justice and charity that binds us all into one human family
8062440 this facility in this minority neighborhood should offend every african american and latino family and all of us because every child lost to abortion here subtracts one more life one more universe of possibilities and talent from the future of this community
8062441 the connection between abortion and racism is that certain people are somehow not fully human
8062442 like racism abortion allows us to treat people inhumanely if it makes our lives easier and like racism abortion provides a sense of justification for actions we know in our hearts are wrong
8062443 the unborn are obviously easier to discriminate against than any group of born humans they cannot march they cannot protest they are invisible
8062444 we want to commend those men and women and say that life is a civil right life is precious and that it transcends politics

8062452 the sexism was in all states from one to ten
8062453 like when tucker carlson said that whenever he heard her voice he wanted to cross his legs that was a nine or ten
8062454 my gut is that there is sill an acceptable level of sexism in this country that even in mixed company you can say incredibly sexist things
8062455 the most frustrating thing about it is that it went unchallenged by the party by the candidates but also by the rest of the press the media should be a watchdog for that sort of thing
8062456 when hulk hogan endorsed obama there were hours of coverage when the astronaut john glenn endorsed clinton it was a ticker

8062459 even when she won pennsylvania by 10 points they werent talking about how marvelous that was they were talking about how it was less than the 15 that they though she should win

8062471 finally the facts about car free space in golden gate park speak for themselves as someone who spends a lot of time in the park with my family on sundays it is obvious hat this is one of the most popular and successful programs in the city
8062472 now thanks to this study it is proven that car free space has positive impacts not only in the park but also in the neighborhoods we are relieved that the myths about negative impacts on the neighborhoods have finally been dispelled by the facts
8062473 relatively quickly on both saturday and sunday although visitors reported finding parking on sunday somewhat faster
8062474 now that we have the facts mayor newsom should join the ranks of the worlds most environmentally friendly cities and fulfill the promise he made when he hosted world environment day two years ago and finally make san francisco into a model sustainable and livable city

8062489 war is never just another means that one can choose to employ for settling differences between nations
8062490 the point is that coercion is simply not to be justified unless it is answerable to a clear account of common good
8062491 the need for a ruler or government to be exposed to assessment by larger standards of the human good than national interest
8062492 war as a moral option is a tool for the promotion of specific social goods
8062493 as for heretics their sin deserves banishment not only by excommunication but also from this world by death to corrupt the faith whereby the soul lives is much graver than to counterfeit money which supports temporal life since forgers and other malefactors are summarily condemned to death by the civil authorities with much more reason may heretics as soon as they are convicted of heresy be not only excommunicated but also justly be put to death

8062542 education should teach people how to live or how to make a living
8062543 i never thought i would homeschool but after trying my son in several different schools we were at our wits end our
8062544 after one particularly bad day when he came home in tears and humiliated we agreed to try homeschooling for the rest of third grade that was two years ago and it has really worked out for us
8062545 i dont really believe in homeschooling and i dont want to do it but i have to because of my children and the way schools worked
8062546 term to describe those starting to homeschool motivated by a process of elimination not because homeschooling is their primary choice
8062547 i had starting homeschooling when i found that the schools just did not work for my children my initial attitude was bitterness with the schools and the blunders and accidents that had forced me to take on the education ourselves

8062549 over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8062550 more honest effort to lay out the authentic position of the church
8062551 im going to assume from her remark that she had a fundamental misunderstanding of the catholic opposition to abortion as a fundamental teaching of the church
8062552 i hope she understands this is not an historical controversy recently settled but a long standing fundamental teaching of the catholic church that abortion is inherently immoral and perhaps it will help open her heart
8062553 scandalous is the word that many catholics use when they feel that a catholic elected official of the highest rank fundamentally is erroneous about what is catholic teaching or not
8062554 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable
8062555 speaker of the house nancy pelosi is a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
8062556 is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it
8062557 her views on when life begins were informed by the views of saint augustine who said the law does not provide that the act abortion pertains to homicide for there cannot yet be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation
8062558 while catholic teaching is clear that life begins at conception many catholics do not ascribe to that view

8062567 its fantastic having won this race especially after the disappointment of budapest the team did an amazing job in preparing for this grand prix and the benefits of that could be seen right from the very first day yesterday i got pole and today the win with the race fastest lap as the icing on the cake you cannot ask for more especially at my one hundredth grand prix with every single one of them powered by a ferrari engine i got a good start and i pushed to the maximum right from the early laps in the second part of the race the car was exceptional but also in the final stint when i had the softer tyres i could do the lap times easily this is an important moment in my career and i must continue to work in this way i am sorry for what happened to kimi we have to look very carefully at our reliability i am confident the team knows which countermeasures to take to react to this issue as it has always done in the past
8062568 i cant complain with second place today this was a strong weekend for us despite my having a few problems health wise but we pulled through the track was pretty difficult to overtake on but i maintained the gap our lap times showed that our overall pace was good which was encouraging heikki kovalainen and i scored 13 points today which is very positive for the team so id describe it as a satisfactory weekend for us
8062569 i started pretty well but in corner one i went over the kerb and lewis was closing in the second corner i was going to overtake lewis but i saw felipe braking quite early it would have been too much of a risk as i could end up overshooting the braking point and crashing into him over the next few laps i was consistently a bit slower than lewis suddenly i saw a white plastic bag flying across the track but could not avoid it and it went under the car i couldnt steer for two corners which was extremely dangerous fortunately most of the bag soon flew away but my confidence was very low over the next sector and i lost around three seconds in the end i finished third eventually i think my good qualifying result yesterday was crucial for todays result
8062570 my start was good and i was consequently able to overtake kimi raikkonen before the first corner however im not really happy with how the race went for me after that because i had grip problems with the prime tyres in the first and second stints whereas with the option tyres in the last stint i had much better grip and traction as a result i could close the gap to robert kubica a little at least i scored five points but a podium would have been much nicer having said that its good that the team scored a lot of points with lewiss second place and my fourth place
8062571 that was a good result and a great performance by the team the weekend started badly for me but it has finished really well today so im happy i could drive a strong race without attacking much i pushed very hard when i needed to while paying attention to taking care of my tyres and my brakes throughout this shows how good we are getting and how nice it is to race with a competitive car every weekend toyota is doing a very good job this year and looking strong and more competitive at every circuit the team is still pushing with the development work so im confident that we can maintain the form in the coming races and keep the points coming
8062572 incredible a perfect day it was fun but tough and hot out there its a nice race track my start was not so good on the dirty side and going into turn one i was right on the limit and very close to kimi raikkonen and could defend my position against jarno for the first stint but he had a bit more fuel on board and stayed out an extra lap and he overtook me in the pits but we can be very very happy with this result we made no mistakes no mistakes all weekend and maximised our performance the whole team can be very proud of what it has achieved and hopefully for the next races we can be in the top ten again
8062573 that was one of my hardest races ever because i have had a bad cold for the last two days but i had a good car and the right strategy and i think p7 was the best result we could have achieved today so im really happy i made up some places at the start and then just tried to do my race it was tough in the middle of the race and in the last 10 laps i pushed as hard as i could to stay concentrated considering our qualifying and my condition i am happy its a great result for the team to get both cars into the points for the constructors championship
8062574 im pretty happy with that its good to be going home with a point today as its been a long time since it happened the race went quite well for me and i was giving it my all driving what felt like qualifying laps one after the other the result is also good for the team as it shows we are getting back on track once again i would like to say that valencia has done a great job here and the race was good fun
8062575 this was one of the worst races ever for me to finish ninth in a car which is obviously good enough for third is a disaster after qualifying i was pretty confident because we realised we could go well but in the race i had big problems with the harder tyres during the first two stints and it was only better at the end with the softer compound i lost one position after the start and later in the race i couldnt gain any the pace wasnt there
8062576 that was a very nice race apart from the fact that i touched with heidfeld which broke my wing which was a real shame as i had to do 17 laps like that losing around 20 seconds to the group i was in the next two stints were good quality and i had a good pace but i am happy with the result and i think we had the right strategy its my best result since australia and especially from the second stint onwards i felt much more comfortable and confident with the car and felt i could push as the track rubbered in as for the next races i continue to tackle them one at a time and hope that next time out in spa i can make it into the points
8062577 the first lap was rough as i was in the middle of the pack and lost several positions after that i tried to fight back but my front wing was damaged and it was difficult to overtake its a shame that we couldnt get into the top ten but i hope we can have a better race in spa for the belgian grand prix in a couple of weeks time
8062578 we just werent quick enough we were hoping for a few safety cars to come out during the race so ran a one stop strategy but it didnt happen it was a difficult race pace wise and weve got a lot of analysis to do
8062579 i had a good start to the race and gained three places to 13th but that was the highlight of my race really we made things difficult for ourselves by qualifying so far back on the grid after we had expected to perform a lot better i was heavily fuelled compared to most others and running long on a one stop strategy but i was stuck behind heidfeld when he had already pitted which cost me some time as i didnt have the pace to overtake him we ran the option tyre for the second stint which was initially fine but then the rears went away quite badly due to the rear brakes overheating
8062580 it was a difficult race with the very hot conditions but overall i think it was a good performance the strategy wasnt bad but we did expect a safety car after seeing the other support races but there werent any incidents so it didnt come our pace was good it wasnt far off the others and we made a step forward with the gearbox we now have to keep focussed and keep moving forward
8062581 i had a bad start and we have to find the reason for that on lap one going into turns four and five i was just behind alonso but there was a bit of a battle going on in front and i couldnt avoid him going into the corner after that i just tried to be consistent my pace was ok but i was behind barrichello and it was really difficult to overtake eventually i made it past him and my pace improved but it was too late
8062582 after qualifying we took the opportunity to start from the pit lane and work on the car to try and resolve the issues that we had yesterday we changed the brakes completely so the car was very different to drive but it did improve a little bit during the race we need to get to the bottom of the brake problems that we have had all weekend as these cost me a lot of time and positions it was a poor weekend overall
8062583 i was hit from behind on the first lap i came back and passed a couple of cars but when i tried to pass one of the force indias i aborted the manoeuvre and made contact with them so sorry to them for that that damaged my barge board and the side of the car so after that the balance and downforce were very poor
8062584 not much to say after a day like this it was definitely not the weekend i was hoping for but i do not believe that despite this negative result i am now out of the running for the title there are still six races to go and sixty points up for grabs we have seen that the situation change really quickly even if i realize things are now more complicated today i lost a place at the start and i was stuck in traffic for all of the first stint then when i had a clear track ahead of me i was able to push and was doing good lap times at the second pit stop i made a mistake and left before i should have done fortunately pietro timpini is not too badly hurt i wish him all the best and hope he gets better soon in any case it would not have changed anything as then the engine broke now we must concentrate on preparing for the next rounds and on improving our qualifying performance
8062585 the first stint was okay as i was closing the gap to the rest of the field and then i could pass a few cars in the hairpin it was a shame that i couldnt pass giancarlo quickly enough to take full advantage of the two stop strategy and lost a little time once i passed him it was getting better but it was still difficult to pass more cars then under braking i lost the rear and tried to avoid a crash but the barrier was too close and that was it
8062586 i was very determined that if i was ever given a chance i would become a doctor so i could make people well and return the individual back to the family
8062587 that has stuck in my heart all this time and given me the motivation to finish chiropractic school medical college and my residency program
8062588 at six oclock you can see this is all dust being blown out ahead
8062589 literally it went from about 0 to 50 in no time as that cold front came across
8062590 this was a typical situation with a red flag warning where the strong winds very dry air very hot
8062591 it might have been in the 40 to 50 mile per hour range but as the winds approach right crest that ridge line there it can exceed 10 to 20 miles faster than surrounding other areas
8062592 the flames are going up hill and preheating the fuels out ahead of it you are now igniting fuels that are already drier than the surrounding area because the flames ahead of it
8062593 in this case a substantial part of the burned area was flat so rains could just puddle there a little bit so the flooding situation should be really nonexistent

8062606 selayaknyalah bagi seorang istri yang berakal apabila ia mendapatkan pasangannya seorang yang sholeh dan cocok dengannya untuk bersungguh sungguh menggapai ridhonya dan menjauhi segala hal yang menyakitinya karena kapan saja istri tersebut menyakitinya atau melakukan apa pun yang dibencinya maka akan berakibatkan kejenuhan suaminya pada dirinya dan apabila ada kesempatan bisa saja ia meninggalkannya dan memilih istri selainnya
8062607 ketika aku berwudhu aku dapatkan istriku wudhu bersamaku dan ketika aku sholat ia juga ikut sholat dibelakangku hingga ketika di akhir sholat aku berdoa agar ia menjadi pelita hidupku yang diberkahi agar allah juga memberikanku kebaikannya dan menjauhiku dari keburukannya
8062608 aku adalah wanita yang masih asing bagimu bolehlah kiranya engkau katakan kepadaku apa yang kau sukai agar aku hadirkan untukmu dan katakan juga apa apa saja yang tidak engkau sukai agar aku menjauhinya darimu
8062609 siapa saja dari para tetangga kita yang kau inginkan mereka mengunjungimu lalu aku jawab siapa saja yang kuinginkan
8062610 sejak itu aku tinggal bersamanya dengan harmonis dan penuh kebahagiaan dan kemesraan hingga pada suatu hari ketika aku kembali ke rumahku aku dapatkan seorang wanita tua yang sedang menasehati istriku lalu aku bertanya

8062615 my answer will depend on how you behave what you provide and so on
8062616 the sooner we meet and you provide what is necessary the sooner your problems will disappear
8062617 i dont know who this mr browder is as you say why he cannot return to russia
8062618 there might have been some kind of complications there might have been some kind of conflicts conflicts with the authorities conflicts in the business world interpersonal conflicts but thats life its complicated and varied if a person thinks that his rights have been violated let him go to court we have a legal system that works thank god
8062619 if ever there was a definition of legal nihilism this is it
8062620 instead they drive me out of the country and tarnish everything that i did there
8062621 i had a lot of my family in me and tried to find a way of connecting my past to my future
8062622 you had to become a shareholder activist if you didnt want everything stolen from you

8062627 its legal maneuvering may go down as the single worst use misuse of social media
8062628 recent discoveries in the tallow chandlers and the joiners companies
8062629 your brain is consumed with big questions today maybe unrelated to the real world thats okay go in deep and see what you learn it may be time for you to try a novel approach to something mundane
8062630 i am not sore for being left out i have always said long ago that these surveys whenever they are being publicized are used for mind management because if you are high in the survey big businessmen tend to give you more
8062631 my fear is that the voters would not know the candidates anymore because the perceived front runners would be reluctant to join any debates
8062632 we should not just believe these surveys barack obama used to trail hillary clinton but he beat hillary for the democratic nomination obama used to lead republican candidate john mccain now they are just even
8062633 the big story was women voters why did so many switch to hillary three pop psych theories
8062634 even without aerial eradication the program which costs around 1 billion a year may be the single most ineffective program in the history of american foreign policy
8062635 the location of narcotics cultivation is the result not the cause of insecurity
8062636 will only make the effort fail more quickly because it actually builds the insurgency it is trying to eliminate
8062637 obamas reputation for integrity and his classy political style dont suggest that he would peddle something so intellectually dishonest but how can he really believe it
8062638 i welcome the genuine reductions of violence that have taken place although i would point out that much of that violence has been reduced because there was an agreement with tribes in anbar province sunni tribes who started to see after the democrats were elected in 2006 you know what the americans may be leaving soon and we are going to be left very vulnerable to the shias we should start negotiating now thats how you change behavior
8062639 there is real opportunity that did not exist at the start of the year what is critical to understand however is that while the surge strategy has had value in some areas much of this progress has not been the function of the surge strategy

8062642 seth godin is the top marketing guru followed at no 2 by apples steve jobs
8062643 they began the interviews saying that parents give you everything and yes you should tell them everything
8062644 lying is a symptom often of a bigger problem behavior
8062645 im sure he must lie some but when i hear it ill still be surprised
8062646 can your child tell the difference between the truth and a lie
8062647 george im glad that you cut down the tree after all hearing you tell the truth instead of a lie is better than if i had a thousand cherry trees
8062648 we dont explicitly tell them to lie but they see us do it they see us tell the telemarketer im just a guest here they see us boast and lie to smooth social relationships
8062649 often the parents are proud that their kids are polite they dont see it as lying
8062650 where did you get these pok mon cards i told you youre not allowed to waste your allowance on pok mon cards
8062651 many parents today believe the best way to get teens to disclose is to be more permissive and not set rules
8062652 kids who go wild and get in trouble mostly have parents who dont set rules or standards their parents are loving and accepting no matter what the kids do but the kids take the lack of rules as a sign their parents dont care that their parent doesnt really want this job of being the parent
8062653 its a lot harder to enforce three rules than to set twenty rules
8062654 ironically the type of parents who are actually most consistent in enforcing rules are the same parents who are most warm and have the most conversations with their kids
8062655 their perception of the fighting was really sophisticated far more than we anticipated for teenagers
8062656 they saw fighting as a way to see their parents in a new way as a result of hearing their mothers point of view be articulated
8062657 but we didnt have anybody in our study with an extreme amount of conflict
8062658 stories of affairs kept from spouses stories of squandering money or being a salesperson and screwing money out of car buyers
8062659 one told of eating the icing off a cake then telling her parents the cake came that way another told of stealing some coins from a sibling
8062660 i had to reframe my understanding to consider what it must have been like as a child to have told this lie
8062661 for young kids their lie challenged their self concept that they were a good child and that they did the right thing
8062662 we had some who said i told this lie i got caught and i felt so badly i vowed to never do it again others said wow i never realized id be so good at deceiving my father i can do this all the time the lies they tell early on are meaningful the way parents react can really affect lying
8062663 lets all calm down and consider the question is john mccain a small c or large c conservative odd that his surname should contain both or is he not a conservative at all
8062664 were from the far right were here to be mollified
8062665 o k heres the plan well tank this one and then look like heroes four years from now let us march
8062666 all right you blinking high maintenance idjits if this is what it takes im willing to do it but honestly id rather be doing vodka shots with hillary clinton
8062667 i believe the acts of this newest generation of soldiers like marcus will match the determination valor and faith of such famed world war ii combat groups

8062669 wes clarks class and credentials make him a vital player in the global conversation about war and peace especially these days
8062670 in addition to his natural charisma people are drawn to gen clarks foreign policy expertise
8062671 at a time when our country has been taken to war with no exit strategy wes is someone who has had a successful track record of conflict resolution
8062672 wes clarks class and credentials make him a vital player in the global conversation about war and peace especially these days
8062673 maybe shes looking at clark instead of bill richardson for vice president
8062674 besides have you noticed that richardsons suits never fit right why is that you have to have suits that fit
8062675 my job is to bring as many people to television as possible but also to do things that are promotable and young
8062676 my mantra was make sure its sgt pepper make sure the level of detail is such that when a viewer sees it it will look like a whole other world willy wonka with a csi ny vibe

8062682 i make a careful distinction between my government and this administration
8062683 he took his cigar out of his mouth just long enough to say twirl around
8062684 i dont think he got the memo on how to treat female employees
8062685 it would be revisionist and wrong to say we knew all along there was no wmd weapons of mass destruction
8062686 i knew of him and his reporting had been completely discredited
8062687 that doesnt preclude a parallel conspiracy at the white house
8062688 it was a precursor to the swift boating of john kerry
8062689 a civil suit is our means of getting to the truth now
8062690 the choice once again is between rejectionism and courage between endless war and leadership toward peace
8062691 the saudi foreign minister even applauded after my address thats never happened before
8062692 sadats trip to israel has stunned the international community israel and egypt have fought four wars and israel still occupies the sinai peninsula part of egypt that it captured in the 1967 war
8062693 the egyptian leaders offer in a speech to his parliament on 9 november to travel to israel was widely regarded as no more than a literary flourish when prime minister menachem begin responded by issuing an official invitation nobody believed mr sadat would accept his presence in israel breaks an arab policy of not dealing publicly with the jewish state created in 1948
8062694 we really and truly welcome you to live among us in peace and security
8062695 we used to reject you we refused to meet with you anywhere yes we were together in international conferences and organizations and our representatives did not and still did not exchange greetings with you yes this has happened and is still happening
8062696 i have chosen to present to you in your own home the realities devoid of any scheme or whim
8062697 the normally thronged streets of this ancient city were virtually empty millions of people sat quietly by televisions and radios in their homes and cafes hanging on every word of sadats speech to the israeli knesset
8062698 this man has put his position in danger maybe even his life to defend the arab cause i dont know whether it will prove to be a mistake in the end but i do know that my respect for his courage and integrity has grown and i think other egyptians feel the same way if nothing else the whole world should be convinced that sadat is sincere in his desire for peace
8062699 arab states should also reach out to israel work toward the normalization of relations and demonstrate in both word and deed that they believe that israel and its people have a permanent home in the middle east
8062700 fair game my life as a spy my betrayal by the white house
8062701 the cia was certainly born out of the old boys network

8062715 grangemouth is surrounded by docks and you expect to hear seagulls in such areas but it was really starting to get out of control
8062716 when they started attacking people it became like a scene out of alfred hitchcocks the birds
8062717 our birds of prey or raptors as we tend to call them are specially trained to scare off gulls without causing them or their young any harm
8062718 originally consideration had been given to accessing the mountain with a chartered helicopter flight but due to rapidly rising fuel costs this option became too expensive

8062720 the pinapa chief came into base camp shouting and waving his machete
8062721 our cook seemed to be the brunt of the anger and was chased around the camp site by one of the chiefs men lashing out with his machete

8062723 now on his 11th best selling business book godin is a web legend with a cult following and even an action figure his talent as a writer is to impart his techie zeal without the baggage of geek jargon
8062724 its not an accident that almost all the brands products and careers that have succeeded with new marketing are brand new and fresh
8062725 it insists on a reinvention of the entire organization and the products it creates
8062726 when i send a note to your ceo who gets it
8062727 fundamentally changed the dynamic of running and growing an organization
8062728 the need for an authentic story as the number of sources increases
8062729 let me not just try to buy some sizzle let me rethink what it means to be in business to run an organization
8062730 these are not real grievances for al qaida they are a means of convincing the world that it is locked in a cosmic contest between the forces of truth and falsehood belief and unbelief good and evil us and them
8062731 perhaps he can tell us why we did not attack sweden for example
8062732 you have destroyed nature with your industrial waste and gases more than any other country
8062733 the rich and wealthy who hold sway in their political parties and fund their election campaigns with their gifts
8062734 bush left no room for doubts or media opinion he stated clearly that this war is a crusader war he said this in front of the whole world so as to emphasize this fact when bush says that they try to cover up for him then he said he didnt mean it he said crusade bush divided the world into two either with us or with terrorism the odd thing about this is that he has taken the words right out of our mouths
8062735 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
8062736 for the leader storytelling is action oriented a force for turning dreams into goals and then into results
8062737 may we use this visit to ask for permission to film in the harbor
8062738 but you are certainly free to tell your story just remember no autographs and no gifts
8062739 and so does history you are the steward of havanas history and it is up to you to share it with the world
8062740 we dont go hunting in the great wood not since that terrible day when three of our bravest were killed there by unknown beasts heres how it happened
8062741 when i pitch a story i have to sell myself who i am the same is true of every leader in business or any other field take barack obama his story is all about who he is and everything about him is part of it down to his physical presence the eye contact the hand on the shoulder the sound of his voice
8062742 i have my own story development company it consists of three or four young women who represent my marketing department i bounce everything off them every new idea scene plot twist character development big speech i study their reactions and then even more important study my reaction to them i dont necessarily follow their advice what i must follow is my own deepest instinct and this is best revealed to me as i see how i respond to the feelings and thoughts of other people
8062743 we never expected that but somehow it makes perfect sense
8062744 helping people to see themselves as the hero of the story
8062745 everyone wants to be a star or at least to feel that the story is talking to or about him personally
8062746 encourage your people to join your journey your quest and reach the goal that lies at its end
8062747 make the i in your story become we so the whole tribe or community can come together and unite behind your experience and the idea it embodies
8062748 there was nothing they could do to me at salomon brothers in the 80s that was worse than the seventh grade
8062749 sheer repetition and the practice it brings is one key to great storytelling when we help companies sell themselves to wall street we often see the ceo and his team present their story 10 20 30 times and usually each telling is better and more compelling than the one before
8062750 my friend carl sagan used to say extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence well weve heard some wonderful stories today and they make extraordinary claims i would just point out the following hundreds of people who believe theyve been abducted by aliens have told stories like the ones weve just heard and yet despite all these hundreds of supposed abductions not a single souvenir has ever been brought back not a single tool or document or drinking glass or so much as a thimble given the total absence of any physical evidence can we really believe these extraordinary claims
8062751 it was a village woman named sufiya begum who taught me the true nature of poverty in bangladesh like many village women sufiya lived with her husband and small children in a crumbling mud hut with a leaky thatched roof to provide food for her family sufiya worked all day in her muddy yard making bamboo stools yet somehow her hard work was unable to lift her family out of poverty why
8062752 like many others in the village sufiya relied on the local moneylender to provide the cash she needed to buy the bamboo for her stools
8062753 sufiya was not alone i made a list of the victims of this moneylending business in the village of jobra when i was done i had the names of 42 victims who had borrowed a total of 856 taka the equivalent of less than 27 at the time what a lesson this was for me an economics professor
8062754 i offered 27 from my own pocket to get these victims out of the moneylenders clutches the excitement that was created among the people by this small action got me further involved if i could make so many people so happy with such a tiny amount of money why not do more
8062755 skewering everone from self absorbed wall street millionaires to hucksterish street politicians the milestone of bonfire provides a moment to consider how the citys own narrative has turned out
8062756 twenty years later the cynicism of the bonfire of the vanities is as out of style as tom wolfes wardrobe
8062757 it becomes increasingly implausible for the wall street multimillionaire white folk living in 8 million manhattan apartments to feel themselves oppressed by poor black people
8062758 they have totally taken over manhattan and are breaching the defenses of even remote parts of harlem are gentrifying the bronx
8062759 today theres not enough crime to become a criminal lawyer
8062760 nobody goes around and sticks up supermarkets anymore or armored cars
8062761 no industry other than the excitement of just being here
8062762 the war on crime in new york city which was basically won by white catholic men from the boroughs
8062763 got treated like dogs and if you were a legitimate guy in a poor neighborhood you had no shot at all
8062764 removed as he is from the lives of black people at least views them as citizens unlike giuliani who viewed them as unruly ambitious children
8062765 as you are no longer excluded your attitude becomes more expansive
8062766 you dont have to like me at all im merely a genius who makes you money
8062767 there it was the rome the paris the london of the twentieth century
8062768 is that eli kind of likes to toy with his dad
8062769 when he called me after he got to ole miss and said he came across my stats in the media guide and that they werent very good
8062770 archie would just kind of subconsciously start to clean up elis apartment you know organize the magazines straighten out all the papers and pens on elis desk
8062771 his dad would clean the same magazines up about two or three times before finally noticing that hed already done it
8062772 and maybe six blitz packages theyd take into each game maybe four coverages and three blitzes against the falcons eli will see that in the first series
8062773 the guys who work the cameras are trying to make a nice picture the risk is always that its too tight
8062774 when former coaches get into the broadcast booth thats the first thing they want to see the all 22 the eye in the sky
8062775 you obviously know what happened but a lot of times you dont know why it happened
8062776 if i was a cop and i saw him out driving a car id pull him over
8062777 and i dont think ive ever had a serious conversation with him
8062778 a lot of good decision making is just eliminating what receiver youre not looking at
8062779 a lot of it is knowing who should be open its a process of elimination that starts even before you take the snap a lot of it just comes naturally its hard to teach someone how to feel pressure for example you arent really thinking about moving around in the pocket you just kind of have to have a feeling for it
8062780 all that noise and it was just a running play
8062781 have you seen anything you hadnt noticed before from watching him
8062782 peyton could probably have named every player in the n f l i dont know if eli could name a hero i dont know if eli could have named a player in the n f l with eli its all very internal you have to dig a bit to see how it all works
8062783 im not the guy who runs down the field with his finger up in the air like i just saved the world

8062787 we all took it sitting on stools in the locker room with no one watching us
8062788 if a quarterbacks score comes in under 25 we worry otherwise we dont pay that much attention to it
8062789 i think the only guy who scored higher than eli was a punter from harvard who didnt make a team
8062790 theres not a job on the planet that requires a person to score at that level
8062791 ummmmm i think i got a 41 or a 42 out of 50
8062792 ummmmmmm i dont think he did as well maybe low 30s
8062793 there is no other position in team sports as important as the quarterback
8062794 a great quarterback unlike a great running back cannot be stopped and if you have a great one youre never out of it he walks on the bus and the whole team sees him and thinks we have a chance
8062795 you cant even see whats on the field and you cant see the formations
8062796 the camera is all over the place on the sidelines in the stands on the coaches faces i had no idea what paul brown and vince lombardi looked like because all you saw back then was the games
8062797 how he responds to the pressure of the game how he responds to the crowd
8062798 when youre trying to find the difference between the great quarterback and the good quarterback you have to feel it the intangibles
8062799 if im going to lose my job its going to be over this not some right guard
8062800 has the quality that you cant define call it magic
8062801 i cant do the tape thing i dont have the stomach for it
8062802 the guys are all covered he didnt have anyone to throw it to they took the run away from us the whole game was on his shoulders but he didnt have any help our receivers werent getting open
8062803 thats one of the things hell learn to do as he matures hell learn to look for his release man
8062804 its easy to talk yourself into thinking it wasnt as bad as it was but im not that way he got the ball to the only people he could get the ball to a quarterback with less poise would have been out there throwing interceptions he was playing within himself he was making smart crisp throws we just didnt give him any help
8062805 you can only do as much as your team lets you do
8062806 but i think he did all he could people will laugh at that but ill invite them to watch the tape
8062807 listen to ideas on how his country might help stop the devastating violence
8062808 we want to talk about the future democracy integrity sovereignty reconciliation and stopping the killings thats my deep aim
8062809 now we are turning the page there is a new perspective we want to talk about the future democracy integrity sovereignty reconciliation and stopping the killings thats my deep aim
8062810 we hope that this visit will herald an increased level of engagement by france with iraq a level consistent with the activism of its foreign minister
8062811 we are ready to be useful but the solution is in the iraqis hands not in the french hands
8062812 im not frightened of the perspective of talking to the americans
8062813 it fills me with pain and anger to see an attack on such poor area where there is no presence of police nor army bases or checkpoints
8062814 we know theyre here and we target them as well
8062815 every four years in the heat of the nominating process liberals and conservatives alike dream of a world in which swing voters dont exist
8062816 the difference between american parties is simple democrats are in favor of higher taxes to pay for greater spending republicans are in favor of greater spending for which the taxpayers will pay
8062817 america is a one party state but just like americans theyve got two of them
8062818 yall may have been malpracticed on by a doctor and not even know it call 800 s h y s t e r
8062819 i look at moneyball as the never ending quest for new ideas the whole idea is to try and get to the next horizon
8062820 it will be read by the end of the day
8062821 most people look at moneyball and say its all about on base percentage and walks i look at moneyball as the never ending quest for new ideas the whole idea is to try and get to the next horizon
8062822 part of the fun of this game is that well never figure it out were never going to get it right what we try to do is become a little less inefficient in our decision making thats moneyball it doesnt mean were going to make the world series every year hopefully we will be competitive every year its no guarantee for success
8062823 from a philosophical standpoint were not averse to spending money
8062824 if we value something at 100 million and we can get it for 50 million do it there is no absolute number the focus is on getting value
8062825 he doesnt always go my way kevin first brought up milton to me he asked me what i thought kevin was driving it as much as anybody
8062826 i believe in milton it was a pretty easy decision for us we believe in milton as a person it came down to three clubs the rangers and royals were the others and all three had some connection with milton i think thats really telling all three wanted him he can make an impact he can change our club this guys still in his late 20s i dont necessarily think weve seen the best of what he can do
8062827 he does more than crunch numbers he scouts players from the quantitative side hes been a major contributor to that type of analysis the analytical approach has been pursued in the past but paul brings something special to that
8062828 i felt like a cross checker this spring i started scouting when i was 24 analysis helped me organize my thoughts
8062829 part of the allure for me here was kevin and coming to a place where i already knew a lot of people
8062830 but it takes a little time for people to realize there was no other agenda
8062831 as long as i feel challenged and we continue to do new things then yes i absolutely can be content here
8062832 id consider it a gm job but only if it were in a near perfect situation i had a sense for how good i had it in oakland i have that same sense here this is good for me professionally and personally its a great balance lifestylewise im not anxious to leave
8062833 anybody who gets into this end of the business with the idea of securing fame and adulation has seriously misplaced motivations
8062834 north korea darfur perhaps burma does this signal a change in chinese foreign policy is there a possibility of greater sino american cooperation on other issues of mutual concern
8062835 in our own way and through various means and various channels
8062836 we used very direct language to persuade them to understand they have to be more flexible
8062837 it is a tale of moral choices and of prejudices transcended
8062838 i could see hunks of metal and rocks sticking out of my legs
8062839 he made sure we knew the world is an unforgiving relentless place
8062840 payback time for the world trade center my goal was to double the number of people they killed

8062848 i was waiting for a good deal to come along and for gulab to turn me over
8062849 id been in so many villages id be like up against the wall and shut the hell up so im like why would these people be kind to me
8062850 i probably killed one of their cousins and now im shot up and theyre using all the village medical supplies to help me
8062851 once you say that you become a muslim youre good to go
8062852 this man gave me shelter and food and must be helped
8062853 he was this wise older person with a big old beard
8062854 it was one of the largest combat search and rescue operations since vietnam
8062855 i was like holy cow dude how am i not going to screw this up
8062856 you want to do your mission but once youre out youre like damn id rather be watching the american puppet movie

8062862 this is marcus luttrell thank you for pulling me off that mountain
8062863 i didnt go over there with any respect for these people
8062864 in the middle of everything evil in an evil place you can find goodness goodness id even call it godliness
8062865 they protected me like a child they treated me like i was their eldest son
8062866 and they brought their uncles to make sure no taliban would kill me
8062867 professional football is an exercise in intensity and one way to handle it is to devise rituals somebody else might pace and listen to hip hop on earphones i lie down with my feet up
8062868 all right all right its time to get out there and get it done
8062869 they want to get out of iraq and get tough on al qaeda at the same time but the idea isnt getting through
8062870 we learned to chant i used to date a beauty queen now i date my m 16 you could get court martialed for losing your weapon and here theyd lost 14 000
8062871 weve sent 5 6 billion to pakistan and what do we have theres no accountability in either afghanistan or iraq
8062872 this is day 2 110 since 9 11 and the man who ordered the massacre is still at large
8062873 even a design democracy needs a few checks and balances
8062874 its a barometer of whats going on in art and design right now
8062875 you want to make sure youre getting printed because its good
8062876 we envisioned threadless at first to be this level playing field where everyone gets an equal shot
8062877 but you start to realize that leaders and popularity and all those things are quite possibly an organic natural part of any community
8062878 who knows it seems the best theory i mean shes talking about how she doesnt like how italian americans are treated
8062879 so lets watch and lets see if this is what america wants
8062880 i had no idea what was going to happen tony sirico tony sirico he was brilliant
8062881 who knows it seems the best theory i mean shes talking about how she doesnt like how italian americans are treated
8062882 the scene cut as the guy was advancing towards him as if he was about to shoot tony it was i think less ambiguous that tony was going to get shot
8062883 i dont mean that theres a monolithic new york theres no one new york theres multiple new yorks anybody who sits and says i know new york is from out of town
8062884 it was a big debate going back and forth to get it straight
8062885 because i think when the details are straight it brings the story to life for people who were never there
8062886 and when i say that i dont mean that theres a monolithic new york theres no one new york theres multiple new yorks anybody who sits and says i know new york is from out of town
8062887 reading about it what touches me and by 1940 my father was making 19 a week was the lack of self pity
8062888 you couldnt feel sorry for yourself which didnt mean some people didnt but the lack of self pity
8062889 in my experience growing up in brooklyn and all that the real tough guys didnt act tough
8062890 they didnt talk tough they were tough you know i think about these politicians who try to pose as tough guys it makes me laugh
8062891 imagine walking down the street in brooklyn and meeting dick cheney would you cross the street
8062892 pete is the authentic voice of working class new york
8062893 combining irish eloquence with brooklyn realism hes served as a voice for immigrants of all colors and a conscience for the entire city
8062894 i know its a cliche but i kind of like this era now
8062895 its like certain things that are not resolved are on their way to being resolved race its not as bitter as it once was
8062896 part of my head will always be in the years after world war ii the five years before korea started
8062897 i was 10 from age 10 to 15 it was a great big wonderful town i saw my first broadway show when i was 11 to see hamlet and i had no idea what they were talking about but i knew it was tremendous
8062898 you cant have the henry steele commager history book on your desk to the left and type it in youve got to let it marinate so that it becomes memory
8062899 he said you got the pool room on the wrong side of the street i said eddie its a novel hes putting me on obviously but he wanted me to know he read it carefully
8062900 and the pool room was on the wrong side of the street
8062901 obviously im biased but it has a fabulous script very close to the book and the production and casting are everything id hoped for
8062902 i cant worry about the competition we have to do something different and its going to take time for us to find our footing
8062903 on the first day ill be waddling on to the set while the crew finds a chair big enough to fit me
8062904 i mean ill be so uncomfortable in so many ways
8062905 there are so many things im going to be scared about at eight months
8062906 its going to be hard for television to top this
8062907 is not going to be an opinion oriented talk show thats not who i am
8062908 keith olbermann and bill oreilly are two of the most talented people on television no question we have to do something different and its going to take time for us to find our footing
8062909 brings a lot of skills that are hard to find she is really interested in and good at hard news without being ponderous on the air
8062910 at nbc i had every opportunity a network could give me
8062911 im a big fan of meredith and i respected the decision
8062912 i know that this is a business the suggestion that this is why im leaving nbc is ridiculous but i had to start to think about what i wanted to do in the next four or five years
8062913 the baby has to choose between watching mommy and daddy
8062914 they tell me that little boys grow up worshiping their mothers so im certain hell be a cnn viewer
8062915 in washington appointing a czar is a way of acknowledging that your policy has gone down the toilet
8062916 it takes guts amid all the hysteria to admit that polar bears love to swim
8062917 the tiger woods of american politics whats not to like
8062918 if hillary wins we get bill back for people in my line of work those were good years
8062919 john wilkes booth shot abraham lincoln to avenge the south john hinckley shot ronald reagan to impress jodie foster
8062920 leaders dont boss not if theyre any good they persuade and i think america needs a whole lot more persuading and a lot less bossing
8062921 the obama campaign is the broadband campaign and the mccain campaign is the dial up campaign
8062922 on mccains watch the u s fell from third to fifteenth in broadband penetration
8062923 you know in your hearts that in eight years there was never one conversation in the on broadband policy
8062924 its not a total naivet that people say in campaigns that they arent able to deliver on but i was cautiously optimistic that there was territory we could bridge
8062925 never really made achieving their goal a serious matter for them
8062926 deploying broadband is really hard work but it is the critical foundation for achieving in my judgment all of our laudable goals
8062927 part of the culture change in my view is to start with a very customer friendly point of view
8062928 i dont think that exists right now budgets have to change people have to change and expertise has to be added to the process
8062929 security issues no we solved that in the airline industry with printable boarding passes this is not something that cant be done its something we havent thought about

8062942 okay heres the concept get a bunch of insanely talented musicians together and let them share songs food and drink many a musical career starts with small audiences impromptu performances late night mutterings and then the lucky end up on large stages and tucked deep inside recording studios often vastly disconnected from those that love their music my friends in the music industry have bellyached that industry folk hardly ever share food in a meaningful way or rarely just get together and effin chill so my good friend michael who has been putting amazing people at for a several years now reached out to me after hed concepted this thing we connected and decided to take this to the next level creating these evenings for our musician friends built around long tables remarkable locations sturdy drinking food and bottles of wine and whiskey with the hope that throughout each night songs would rise up from the table and with the hope that we could share that music with the world this project is a collaboration between my buddy table guru and all around genius michael hebb and yours truly hatched from michaels underground songs for eating and drinking is the bringing together of the worlds most talented musicians and letting them share songs food and drink many a musical career starts with small audiences impromptu performances and late night mutterings these cozy and soulful evenings are a return to those days
8062943 i never thought i would say anything was worse than vietnam but iraq my friends is worse than vietnam
8062944 to the south and southeast neighbors called iran and iraq one a dangerous destabilizing religious dictatorship the other a civil war raging out of control
8062945 iraq already presents us with the worst situation internationally in modern american history worse even than vietnam
8062946 i never thought i would say anything was worse than vietnam but iraq my friends is worse than vietnam
8062947 if it does not succeed then the united states will face an even more difficult set of choices
8062948 you can assume safely the current administration will reject the last option and look for ways to salvage something from the wreckage of its own misguided policies
8062949 we must assume that the next president will inherit the most difficult foreign policy challenges ever to land in the oval office on day one
8062950 whoever it is the odds are very high that disengagement from iraq unless the war is clearly being won will be a very high priority
8062951 any withdrawal should not be done precipitously of course but no one can predict now what the next president will actually confront
8062952 to largely admiring reviews and a warm reception at the box office
8062953 this unerring knack for the tellingly funny anecdote that illustrates his larger point is just one of the reasons why moore has been a true game changer in the documentary film world
8062954 michael moore is out there in the crowded streets of our culture shouting do you not see whats happening in our world
8062955 complexity isnt his subject is it its his fierce moral clarity his subject is our world and its injustices
8062956 he has this preposterous overblown persona that you cant help but get involved with he has the showmanship as well as the delight welles had in getting a rise out of people hes also a technically brilliant filmmaker even if you sometimes wonder am i really getting the whole picture
8062957 if you think youre seeing objective truth when you go to a michael moore film youre missing the whole point
8062958 hes not a journalist striving for objectivity hes a provocateur trying to engage the viewer context belongs to journalism the responsibility of a filmmaker is not to write an essay but to create something exciting or entertaining that stays with you
8062959 but i remember from my days as an on camera interviewer that the question that makes you sweat by the very idea of asking it is the one you should always ask and moores brilliance is that he always asks that question over and over
8062960 when i started trying to get financing for my first documentary asking for 300 000 was a big deal
8062961 now were making movies with 10 million budgets and the big difference is michael moore hes completely changed the landscape by proving to the studios and financiers that documentaries especially ones about social issues can have a healthy theatrical life
8062962 indeed it has often been said that the president got into iraq because he disregarded advice from the true regional experts but what if today these groups were actually advising against an american withdrawal
8062963 the costs of staying are visible the costs of getting out are almost never discussed if we get out before iraq is stable the entire middle east region might start to resemble iraq today getting out is not a solution
8062964 when we are in iraq we are in many ways containing the violence if we back off we give it more room to breathe and it may metastasize in some way and become a regional problem we dont have to be there at the same force level but it is a five to seven year process to get any reasonable stability in iraq
8062965 if america leaves iraq america will have to return soon it will not be a clean break it will not be a permanent goodbye and by the time america returns we will have all been drawn in america will have to stabilize more than just iraq the warfare will have spread to other countries governments will be overthrown americas military is barely holding on in iraq today how will it stabilize iraq plus
8062966 coalition capabilities including force levels resources and operations remain an essential stabilizing element in iraq
8062967 if such a rapid withdrawal were to take place we judge that the iraqi security forces would be unlikely to survive as a non sectarian national institution neighboring countries invited by iraqi factions or unilaterally might intervene openly in the conflict massive civilian casualties and forced population displacement would be probable al qaeda in iraq would attempt to use parts of the country particularly al anbar province to plan increased attacks in and outside of iraq and spiraling violence and disarray in iraq along with kurdish moves to control kirkuk and strengthen autonomy could prompt turkey to launch a military incursion
8062968 friends of mine who are iraqis shiite sunni kurd all foresee a civil war on a scale with bloodshed that will absolutely dwarf what were seeing now
8062969 its difficult to see how this could go anywhere but into a much wider conflagration with all kinds of implications for the worlds flow of oil for the state of israel what happens to king abdullah in jordan if theres complete chaos in the region it just seems to me that the consequences are endless endless
8062970 if you pull out now and catastrophe ensues then it is very likely that the united states would have to come back in circumstances which of course would be even less favorable one might imagine than the ones that now confront american troops here
8062971 we share an interest in politics and world affairs and we talk about them a lot we do disagree but i have no comment on who wins the discussions
8062972 i wish that the president would express his sorrow for what has happened to my wife whose career was destroyed as a consequence of this
8062973 motivated by an antitotalitarian drive whether he sees injustice from the left or the right
8062974 its an amazing appointment a stunning event in french foreign policy
8062975 hes motivated by an antitotalitarian drive whether he sees injustice from the left or the right
8062976 to change the law you sometimes have to break the law
8062977 it was a question of overthrowing an evil dictator and it was right to intervene
8062978 on turkey the withdrawal of troops from afghanistan the third world and africa were not close
8062979 im against his idea of selective immigration on other issues the middle east on the need for an alliance with america on the role of france in europe were not so far apart
8062980 i am not so arrogant to say im serious but im more popular than he is
8062981 i have no recipe except one in politics to continue to continue to be obstinate to be obstinate to never abandon an issue as long as there remains a small shred of hope
8062982 i cant stand the fact that a man is assassinated that a woman is abused that a child is beaten up
8062983 why am i getting indignant my grandparents died in auschwitz and for years no one dared or wanted to tell me i found out
8062984 in a mixed family that is not religious it is even worse you are either twice as jewish or half jewish as a result you react like a tormented soul in the face of oppression
8062985 he hesitated a lot before accepting but what drives him is not a hunger for power but a passion for promoting justice and easing suffering in the world and lets face it hes 67 now hes mellowed like a good wine
8062986 whatever happens in iraq we must try to limit the terrible fallout from the war the place to start should be with our indispensable nato ally turkey the front line state of the post cold war era
8062987 the only way to handle big catastrophic risks was to spread them widely and the only way to do that was to get them out of the insurance industry and onto wall street
8062988 finance was hurling resources at problems it was almost as if i was taking it as a price signal it was societys way of saying please will you start solving problems over here
8062989 the devil has come to you as a prostitute and has asked you to lie down with her
8062990 these academics couldnt understand the fact that they couldnt beat the markets
8062991 he notes that smart risk takers with no gift for theory often end up with smart solutions to taking extreme financial risk answers that often violate the academic theories
8062992 john was known as the man who could price anything and his pricing felt right to people who didnt understand his math
8062993 you could take it and take all the science that also wasnt being used and you could package it in a model that could spit out numbers companies could use to make decisions it just seemed like such an obvious thing to do
8062994 from their point of view all of this was just in this computer
8062995 no one got up and left but no one asked questions either people thought they had already figured it out they were comfortable with their own subjective judgment
8062996 as she ate she wondered what 13 billion in losses looked like
8062997 a few mobile homes and an air force base how much could it be
8062998 but i had a lot of people call and ask to buy the model
8062999 this one woman really created the method for valuing this risk
8063000 there is no physical reason why georgia has not been hit georgias just been lucky
8063001 if you could take a magnitude 8 earthquake and distribute its shock across the planet no one would feel it
8063002 just by looking at the different numbers they generated for the same storm
8063003 in the financial markets you have to care what other people think even if what they think is screwed up
8063004 crowd dynamics build on each other but these things hurricanes earthquakes dont exhibit crowd behavior theres a real underlying risk you have to understand you have to be a value investor
8063005 he quits this high paying job to basically open a business in his garage in a market that doesnt exist
8063006 i had once read the letters between pierre de fermat and blaise pascal
8063007 from my father i had learned that most great mathematicians were nasty guys and total jerks check out isaac newton extra nasty guy but when i read the fermat pascal letters you could see that fermat was an exception to the stereotype truly a noble person i loved his character and found that his way of analyzing profitless games of chance probability theory was the key to understanding how to analyze profitable games of chance investment theory
8063008 my boss wont let me buy bonds that i have to watch the weather channel to follow
8063009 investors who object to cat bond investing usually say that its just gambling
8063010 but the more mature guys say thats what investing is
8063011 the fact that were making 10 million bets on whether charley is going to hit tampa or not it made them a little nervous at first we told them not to worry about what were going to do with the information just give it to us
8063012 the word had gotten out that buying in the storm was the smart thing to do
8063013 and we were afraid our past successes would give us an irrational interest in buying everythings all fuzzy in these events and when things are fuzzy your brain gives you an excuse to push the envelope so we adopted a policy before the season of staying out of the market
8063014 it was considered unsinkable because it had a hull of 16 chambers
8063015 they probably said what are the odds of four chambers going
8063016 there might have been a one in a hundred chance of puncturing a single chamber but the odds of puncturing four chambers they probably thought of as one in a million thats because they thought of them as independent chambers and the chambers might have been independent if the first officer hadnt gambled at the last minute and swerved by swerving the iceberg went down the side of the ship if the officer had taken it head on he might have killed a passenger or two but the ship might not have sunk the mistake was to turn often people associate action with lowering risk or controlling risk but experience shows more often than not that by taking action you only make the risk worse
8063017 the reigning theory is that the taste for risk is as arbitrary as the value of a painting
8063018 but if this is so why are these preferences so consistent across markets
8063019 if i had been lazy i could have just quoted 4 million for the premium
8063020 it would have been obnoxious to do so but traders have been known to do it
8063021 what i noticed after the fact is that this exotic options price was special
8063022 here i saw the beginnings of a market mechanism that directly links 1 in 10 year risk pricing to 1 in 100 year risk pricing
8063023 a happy agreement between human psychological perception and hard mathematical logic
8063024 florida took this notion of spreading this risk and turned it on its head
8063025 they said were going to take all this risk ourselves
8063026 the state sold its citizens catastrophe insurance at roughly one sixth the market rates thus encouraging them to live in riskier places than they would if they had to pay what the market charged and in the bargain the state subsidized the well to do who live near the beach at the expense of the less well to do who dont
8063027 what they need to do is take the risk and kick it up to us
8063028 its like all the actions of man and nature serve to grow the cat bond market
8063029 the important thing is that the money wasnt lost in an unearned manner
8063030 i would be embarrassed if we had a big event and our loss wasnt commensurate with it it would mean that we didnt serve society we failed society
8063031 learning to disagree without getting personal is a valuable skill
8063032 we can preach democracy and free markets and a civil society and all these ideals we hope to export to that part of the world but if an iraqi cant walk out the front door without fear of getting blown up it doesnt matter how many jobs programs you have it doesnt matter how many times you offer them an election to vote it doesnt matter
8063033 i am concerned however that the presidents surge is a little too little a little too late
8063034 it was pretty extraordinary that the first time the presidents talked about climate change or acknowledged the existence of climate change was in his most recent state of the union address
8063035 i dont know how great a step it is to say they are finally acknowledging that it exists i think that political debate is over i hope its over
8063036 is this just a drop in the bucket if the united states unilaterally decides to do something about it
8063037 if we are going to take these steps we better not be doing it alone
8063038 i think thats all fine and good but i also dont believe that you cant begin taking steps just because china and india are not taking steps
8063039 its much more about the pursuit of the story and getting beyond the spin
8063040 as it turns out the parenting lessons i learned in the months following my sons birth applied equally well to my dad
8063041 what huh no no i m fine i m up
8063042 if i go to bed i won t be able to sleep
8063043 no one understands what we re going through but us
8063044 did you think about what it would take to rebuild postwar europe
8063045 you thought about how you were going to stay warm that night how you were going to get from one hedgerow to another without some german sniper taking you out you didn t worry about tomorrow
8063046 we have to make concrete plans or at the very least you have to call first
8063047 fine fine i m going just let me get another glass of water
8063048 i know dad i love you too now go to bed
8063049 i would vote for a pro war religious person over an anti war atheist
8063050 probably once for an erection but not addressed to anyone in particular nor completely addressed to my cock
8063051 vote for me because i come from a small town
8063052 would you vote for an elderly divorced second rate hollywood actor for president
8063053 an uproarious crystal ballish tale about what could happen if generation y stopped being polite and started getting real about paying for the retirement of 80 million baby boomers
8063054 i have an 18 year old and a 14 year old
8063055 and theyre going to be paying for my incontinence pads sooner or later there will be a reckoning
8063056 its there to remind me as if i needed reminding that im not proust
8063057 i hate to admit it but thats sort of me craven feckless opportunistic but faintly amusing
8063058 i was a sophomore in college and i remember reading a letter he had sent me
8063059 id been sending him my stuff from the yale daily news and i remember him saying what has happened to your writing
8063060 ill send him something and hell say needs editing doesnt it
8063061 we went from being a party of confidence and fiscal restraint and individual liberty to being the party that encouraged intervention in terry schiavos case this disastrous experience in iraq katrina and an 8 5 trillion debt it was hogs feeding at the trough from jack abramoff to karl rove im just sad and angry
8063062 i think all this must be terribly difficult for him
8063063 we had done a weeklong swing through latin america and were all bone tired and punch drunk
8063064 we had been promised a night in rio but the vish decided that he wanted to go back to washington so he could play tennis with jimmy baker
8063065 do you remember what lincoln said when someone complained to him about grants drinking
8063066 find out what kind of whiskey he drinks and send a case to all my other generals i feel that way about christophers drinking
8063067 and they form little cliques and cabals and are very mean to each other
8063068 my favorite faux pas story we tell it with reverence in my family happened to david niven who was a pal of my dad
8063069 we call that in our house the david niven defense it does come in handy
8063070 theres something about being on the move that i find conducive to writing or being in a hotel room if youre in a strange hotel room with nothing to do but wait for the gig theres no better consolation than having to crank out 1 000 words otherwise id go mad
8063071 im with vidal on a lot of stuff i accompany him about three quarters of the way but then he drives it off the cliff you know and starts talking about how jfk was assassinated by general motors i think the ultimate argument against the conspiracy theory involving jfk is when has the u s government ever done anything so efficiently or successfully
8063072 i think george p bush nephew of w son of jeb is the gops barack obama he speaks fluent spanish i wonder if hell be running against chelsea weve gotten ourselves into a situation where you realize weve had presidents bush clinton bush and now the frontrunner is another clinton you have to ask are we turning into a latin american country
8063073 neither of my children has ever read one word that ive written even though ive dedicated books to them they just wont but they have classmates who have read everything ive written i understand it i think its just that children have a way of compartmentalizing and im dad the font of all money
8063074 he has written with tremendous brio and great wit but also with an underlying genuine anger an all out attack on all aspects of religion
8063075 the human wish to credit good things as miraculous and to charge bad things to another account is apparently universal
8063076 we worried far too much about the sheet metal color etc
8063077 what we really needed to worry about was connecting emotionally with our consumers
8063078 these are companies who know they have to take advantage of global trends but at the same time are afraid of jeopardizing core businesses
8063079 we show them how to walk that thin line it often comes down to showing them the language and tonality needed to reach consumers
8063080 rap was a litmus test for where the culture was headed
8063081 if the workers were actually proud of what they were wearing it could be a huge opportunity to promote the brand those kids wouldn t want to change after work and stuff it in a knapsack
8063082 we know the cutting edge comes from the african american and hispanic communities
8063083 steve was very good at getting our whole organization to buy in on this new direction
8063084 but he made a very strong case for why we needed to be more cosmopolitan
8063085 instead they needed to align the brand to the sound and rhythm of sports with fashion
8063086 i like to see how they touch fabric or view a display
8063087 or listen to what they say to their husbands for me it is more fun than going to the movies
8063088 we were attempting to make coors an arbiter in the renaissance of sophisticated beer drinking
8063089 tiger and gm share similar values of integrity and most importantly diversity
8063090 a metro mindset that 34 year old independent thinking person
8063091 one of the first things steve asked us was do you know that there have been 700 songs written about chevy why aren t you leveraging that
8063092 what the nie does not say is more interesting than its anemic wording about indisputable facts
8063093 bush made them stronger new intel report ignores 3 inconvenient truths about terror
8063094 is and will remain the most serious terrorist threat to the homeland as its central leadership continues to plan high impact plots while pushing others in extremist sunni communities to mimic its efforts and to supplement its capabilities
8063095 w e judge that al qaeda will intensify its efforts to put operatives here
8063096 whatever ingredient went into the decision for him to go i m so pleased that he went
8063097 go down in history as the leni riefenstahl of the beijing games
8063098 whatever ingredient went into the decision for him to go i m so pleased that he went
8063099 only recently that he became aware of china s involvement there
8063100 if olympic games and darfur issue together to raise his her fame he she is playing a futile trick
8063101 we have indications at this point that the chinese are now taking even a more aggressive role than they have in the past
8063102 i ve been talking to them and telling them this is coming this is coming
8063103 i told them there s an infrastructure out there they need to feed the beast and you re in their sight
8063104 their goal is not to get in bed with every sleazy government that comes up with a little oil
8063105 full scale launch of a large organized campaign to highlight china s complicity in the darfur genocide
8063106 it s time now to begin shaming china demanding that if the beijing government is going to host the summer olympic games of 2008 they must be responsible partners
8063107 this will make a huge difference to the children in a very special way
8063108 we want our students to be involved in the events of their community
8063109 last month the students walked laps around watchung lake in another community service fund raiser and raised more than 10 000
8063110 this will make a huge difference to the children especially children who survived the earthquake in may in indonesia many kids are living in rubble and now with the monsoon coming everything will be ruined again
8063111 in czechoslovakia my home we were restricted in our freedoms we couldnt learn any other language besides russian i didnt know who stevie wonder was until five years ago
8063112 i have to work really really hard this life is not all champagne and caviar
8063113 it will help you connect with those children in a very special way
8063114 eventually i want to be able to do anything i want to have the credibility to talk about politics or breaking news that s the top end but i understand there s a process to get there i m starting at the bottom
8063115 i want to have the credibility to talk about politics or breaking news that s the top end but i understand there s a process to get there i m starting at the bottom again
8063116 my entire career from the time i was a rookie to 10 years later my goal was to constantly reinvent myself to find whatever my fault was or whatever i was deficient in and reinvent myself into something powerful
8063117 it got to the point where i couldn t reinvent myself any more when you hit the top of your profession what do you aspire to
8063118 while they admire you and they appreciate what you do on the football field there s this reserved right to be able to determine when we go in a lot of ways i robbed people of that because i went out on top
8063119 it s an american dream to be a professional athlete fans wonder how can i throw away making a ton of money being a popular sports figure to do something else it s confusing because they don t have the answer
8063120 my mother nurtured us to be the kind of people and players that we became
8063121 we persevered through a lot we were always achievers and we would never want to let her down
8063122 in all of his life whatever he set out to do he will do whatever it takes to be successful and to get the job done and to get it done in a more than acceptable way
8063123 these failures that came along they happened to me but i didn t let them conquer me so i never did fail
8063124 i have team regrets that we didn t win to continue forward but i definitely have not a single regret for those games and my entire career
8063125 my ups and downs i wouldn t change for the world because the struggles i went through made me appreciate when i became successful
8063126 at fox news and wcbs i was dabbling i was putting my foot in the door
8063127 but to actually have this as my profession is different it s a great responsibility to me so i have to work to get to that same point as i was as a football player
8063128 that s the challenge in it that s why i love it because i love a challenge
8063129 getting to know matt lauer and seeing matt do what he does and having a trust and a confidence about himself in delivering the room whether it be putting on a silly halloween costume or interviewing the president he s the kind of person that i want to be
8063130 i m honored to be able to learn from him a little bit and direct my path
8063131 interreligious dialogue should have a purpose but it should not be to shed light on the errors and illusions of your neighbors faith
8063132 why diana was important why she continues to fascinate and what we should make of her 10 years after her death
8063133 what makes it an ongoing saga is that her memory lives on through her husband and the actions of her two sons
8063134 the diana books have been trending down from a sales perspective over the last couple of years because there hasn t been anything new to say
8063135 but this is going to be a summer of celebrating diana and that will re create interest in her
8063136 will there be new information and pictures people haven t seen before and will there be so much news coverage that people won t have to read the book
8063137 publicity could save the diana chronicles but there isn t a lot of enthusiasm in the heartland
8063138 somebody has gotten word so i ll buy a few more
8063139 we re a world obsessed with youth and she never ages
8063140 she used to say i m thick as a plank what she had was a huge emotional intelligence that people responded to
8063141 neediness collided with a culture designed not to meet those needs it couldn t have been more cataclysmic
8063142 princess diana was a manipulative schemer who was ruthless in her pursuit of prince charles a bombshell book will claim the account of her extraordinary life to be published weeks before the tenth anniversary of her death paints the princess as spiteful media savvy and neurotic
8063143 the book is an affectionate and multifaceted portrayal of diana
8063144 fined for spitting in the face of blixen earlier in the season rudolph was the object of the fans ire
8063145 given how wasted the fans are its amazing that something like this didnt happen sooner
8063146 i didnt hear everything they said but lets put it this way they were not shouting out with glee
8063147 brown breathes new life into the saga of this royal icon of blondness by astutely revealing just how powerful and how marketable her story became in the age of modern celebrity journalism
8063148 she was way ahead of her contemporaries in foreseeing a world where celebrity was so to speak the coin of the realm
8063149 an aristocrat herself diana knew that the aristocracy of birth was now irrelevant all that counted now was the aristocracy of exposure
8063150 the wedding did for the sales of tatler what the o j simpson chase did for the ratings of cnn it put us on the map
8063151 wedding of the past and the future the radetzky march meets the tatler cover girl but as it turned out the past and the future couldnt get along
8063152 she would automatically sort of make gestures and strike poses
8063153 as a rollicking up yours tabloid featuring bare breasted pinups every day
8063154 was acquiring the stale curdled taste of a british rail cheese sandwich
8063155 pictures of a middle aged princess margaret churning grandly around the dance floor in her caftan in mustique hardly moved product
8063156 the guessing game of the prince of waless love life was the sole excitement for the media
8063157 we really got behind diana and pushed her towards him i am absolutely convinced that we the media forced charles to marry her
8063158 from their accounts no one it seems wanted to break the spell
8063159 i always thought it was the wife first stupid thought
8063160 stupid thought yes or maybe something worse the onset of superstar entitlement six months of adulation from the press had begun to reshape dianas worldview
8063161 i thought she not only knows who she is she knows what this is and how big this is she was so savvy about the media impact of it all
8063162 the sunshine of publicity in which diana would at first be happy to bask posing and smiling for the cameras grew steadily hotter and harsher as the superheated imperatives of an invasive press bumped up increasingly against the milder human necessity of privacy scattered rains gave way to drenching gales and then to spectacular and finally lethal hurricanes diana herself had accelerated the climate change that ended up making her life literally impossible
8063163 i give them something they never imagined they could have a passion for science and a belief in themselves all wrapped up in the fun of model rocketry
8063164 i dont think ive ever seen him run so fast or grin so big
8063165 i find them wherever i can on the streets in schools and in detention centers
8063166 then i give them something they never imagined they could have a passion for science and a belief in themselves all wrapped up in the fun of model rocketry
8063167 i got too busy and lost a couple of my children to the streets
8063168 then their kids got into trouble thats why my wife and i are raising our great granddaughter im going to help every kid i can rocketry is my answer and its working
8063169 then all of them went to college i got the message
8063170 when my students build rockets and fly them they learn surprising things
8063171 for instance they wanted to know how high their rockets flew so i told one student to get the angle at the top of the flight then we all figured out the altitude i asked have you ever heard of trigonometry they all thought it was something hard to learn when i told them they had just worked a trig problem you should have seen how happy they were thats all it takes that one spark
8063172 most of the kids i see in detention centers dont have fathers at home and some have no parents at all
8063173 but when i mention rockets their eyes go bright when i show them video or photos of our launches there are all these oohs and ahs its like one switch gets turned off the one that fills them with rage and another gets turned on they start to see possibilities and find passion inside themselves for something good they start looking up
8063174 it will help us overcome existing stereotypes among americans and arabs
8063175 is that it seemed to be addressed to a real need namely conveying somehow the reality of american life its diversity its fundamental tolerance the kind of thing that is not always understood abroad either by admirers or detractors of america
8063176 one of the things we need to learn how to do much better is communicate with the world of islam we are at this time amateurish
8063177 you will tell me they are not responsible for bush s policies
8063178 and i will tell you that they are the ones who elected bush correct or not
8063179 but we don t want to edit the comments of the stars of these shows
8063180 they want us to come over and do a briefing at the state department
8063181 you know the arab world thinks that israel wants to conquer the middle east
8063182 i never never never never imagined that id have this conversation with someone like you
8063183 is that it will help us overcome existing stereotypes among americans and arabs through the interaction of the talent and through the viewers seeing how the americans dealt with those guys
8063184 tell them to look up tell them to remember the stars
8063185 tell them to look up tell them to remember the stars

8063196 the decline of newspapers is not about the replacement of the antiquated technology of news print with the lightning speed of the internet it does not signal an inevitable and salutary change it is not a form of progress the decline of newspapers is about the rise of the corporate state the loss of civic and public responsibility on the part of much of our entrepreneurial class and the intellectual poverty of our post literate world a world where information is conveyed primarily through rapidly moving images rather than print

8063202 chocolates on the pillow aren t enough reinventing the customer experience
8063203 there is you might think a war waiting to happen between the haves and the have mores and yet no one much complains
8063204 we didn t even know what rules we were breaking
8063205 we were so young a brand new era so new it was the first job that most of us had
8063206 i couldn t wait to get offstage there was no sense of performance
8063207 whenever they needed a large jewish person a drunk someone going through electro shock therapy they d get me out there
8063208 i was once a corpse lying in a f ing coffin but if you look real close my hands were shaking so pathetic
8063209 i consider myself the luckiest guy to make a living doing things i have fun doing
8063210 to every morty dickie or freddie that ever lived before i moved up to people like rodney dangerfield
8063211 because i didnt want to make my parents friends laugh we were the counterculture we were trying to answer alan king s sort of comedy
8063212 doing stand up it was always a proving ground just trying to test out my jokes
8063213 it was a cry for help a big jew drowning and saying throw me a rope
8063214 we were so young a brand new era so new
8063215 it was the first job that most of us had
8063216 we didn t want to go with a new regime there was an amount of burnout and there were new worlds to explore
8063217 i was part of the new thing saturday night live and then it s garry shandling s show which was a new way of doing sitcoms breaking the fourth wall
8063218 this is the theme to garry s show this is the music that you hear while you watch the credits
8063219 it was like putting on a fourth grade play every week creating a new world each week
8063220 they left us alone the network intervention was minimal by the time they caught on they believed in him and ultimately the product enough we were tucked in the corner the stakes were low
8063221 that there would be two shows with my name on it and i d be running along broadway between the two like a neil simon kind of guy
8063222 i ve been very lucky in being part of things that are fun to do
8063223 and the fact that i could do it in different forms
8063224 my idols were people who could do everything larry gelbart woody allen buck henry you couldn t pigeonhole them the material dictated where it wanted to go
8063225 a devour everything in its path monster of a holiday and thank goodness
8063226 it is not just about abu ghraib it is about america and who we are as a country
8063227 it is not just about abu ghraib it is about america and who we are as a country
8063228 in the last three years we are now a country that represents just the opposite and we are now known for torturing people
8063229 that is directly connected to the policies put into place
8063230 what each of them told me is they did it because they were told to do it and everyone else was doing it
8063231 this was in stark contrast to what was coming from the administration and the investigation which were all saying this was not systemic and these were nine bad apples on the night shift
8063232 i hope with a new leadership in congress we will revisit some of these ideas and hopefully change direction in this country
8063233 it seems unjust for 11 low ranking soldiers to be held accountable for what seems to be the work of people much higher up the chain of command
8063234 that injustice is probably something my father would have fought against and in someway motivated me to do this film
8063235 the alternative was never between a tranquil if despotic iraq and a destabilizing foreign intervention it was which kind of intervention there would be
8063236 the role allows me to interact with the audience i do a lot of live shows on campuses i love game shows bringing people on stage asking them questions im kind of getting all of it in one package
8063237 costa rica not only has a lot of land devoted to conservation it also has a social security system which is actually pretty remarkable and a lot of americans are retiring there
8063238 ive been to guatemala which has no distinction that i can think of right now except it has nice flora and fauna
8063239 still at home in my bedroom in my mothers house you can find my cast albums catalogued very carefully
8063240 and so i had to kindly ask my father to please return that
8063241 and i felt guilty because i like shirley jones who doesnt
8063242 the sort of sexual sort of communion you have with an audience
8063243 i mustered the courage after talking to my good friend julia roberts julia said youve got to get back on the boards thats where you belong and so i did it
8063244 this is julia roberts who works at all state in baltimore shes a friend of mine from high school
8063245 it makes sense that im doing this show not only because im playing a teacher and i can be kind of pedantic in real life but also because the role allows me to interact with the audience i do a lot of live shows on campuses i love game shows i like bringing people on stage and asking them questions so im kind of getting all of it in one package
8063246 im prepared i dont anticipate a situation where were going to be kept there for eight hours
8063247 at which point the earth will stop rotating and the show will become an endless interpretive dance
8063248 when i started thinking about doing news today is where i wanted to be
8063249 i think he has to start listening to the players a little bit and come our way their way a little bit
8063250 i dont know if you realize this but we were in full pads for 17 weeks and with the amount of injuries that we had it just takes a toll on you you physically dont want to be out there when your body feels the way you do in full pads
8063251 it probably doesnt have a really detrimental effect on how you practice or how you play it does on your mind and if you lose your mind in this game their game you lose a lot thats something he has to realize and i think he does
8063252 this decision was in my head a year ago i came back because i looked at our talent and thought we could win a super bowl circumstances proved otherwise injuries when our stars arent playing its hard to win
8063253 coach coughlin was nothing but great for me as a player
8063254 but the grind took its toll on me and really forced me to start thinking about what i wanted to do next thats not a bad thing its a good thing at least for me it is maybe not for the giants because they lose one of their great players but for me it is
8063255 he gets put in a very difficult position in this city because they expect him to be his brother
8063256 and he has to live up to all these expectations and no matter how much he says he doesnt think about them it obviously creeps into his head
8063257 these last couple of years in particular have been a dichotomy in some ways
8063258 i became an all star player i became one of the elite players in this league but at the same time the grind started to take its toll on me and the principles of our head coach started to take its toll on me so i started looking for the next thing
8063259 its very rare that you find an athlete at the top of his game who has been as open as tiki has been
8063260 and if youre that open before you come that sort of answers that age old question well are you going to be prepared to speak to your new constituency which is the viewers and the fans or are you going to still be worried about who is behind you in the locker room i think hes answered the question repeatedly while he was in the game
8063261 youll see him all through the program at any given time on any given morning
8063262 when i started thinking about doing news 2 1 2 years ago today is where i wanted to be
8063263 hes been working at this craft for the past couple of years
8063264 were not expecting him to be matt lauer on day one
8063265 the nbc deal will give him the opportunity to grow and develop as a significant tv personality
8063266 hes going to have to go to school but he certainly has all the credentials and qualifications to do well
8063267 gospel of food could be considered a new testament of sorts to help navigate dizzying funhouse of distorted definitions and misinformation
8063268 the culture of fear why americans are afraid of the wrong things
8063269 we would all do well to maintain a healthy skepticism
8063270 about the presumed sanctity and safety of one food or diet over another
8063271 this movie takes us to another time and a lot of people in this country remember when their lives revolved around this music
8063272 im 60 years old and i came up with a lot of that music
8063273 i know about those motown revues because i went to them in 1962 when i was 15 or 16
8063274 i loved those artists i tried to sing like them
8063275 id sit on the corner and try to sing like marvin gaye or the temptations smokey robinson was my favorite i tried to hit those high notes when i was a kid wed read every single magazine story in ebony and other magazines that told us something more about these men and women we idolized
8063276 how do you necessitate the moment of seeing dreamgirls for all of those people who saw the play and visualize it in another medium
8063277 i sat in the audience the other night and saw people respond to this film and it was almost as if it were a play after every song they clapped this movie takes us to another time and a lot of people in this country remember when their lives revolved around this music they had pain listened to it and the music brought them out of it
8063278 hes in another territory and he decides to walk away marty is part of the previous generation one of those men who helped usher their clients to those moments when they had to decide what color of show to stay in to marty james thunder early isnt just his client hes a human being a surrogate son who walked those moments with him
8063279 thats the best thing when the director asks you to be part of it
8063280 i talked to bill and really bought into his vision he asked me to be part of this which was really an opportunity to be part of something really special i knew the musical i was on broadway down the street in master harold and the boys at the same time i knew what dreamgirls meant to the black community in this country people came from all over the country to see that musical
8063281 in a sense it reminds me of 21 years ago when a lot of us came out of the color purple and went on to other things
8063282 that was a special moment for us now this is a moment for them to build their careers
8063283 after sept 11 everyone was united like i have never seen in my lifetime
8063284 we were united understanding that when our freedom is attacked we will do anything we can to defeat those who attack it
8063285 so as we look to the state of the union address monday i hope the president sticks to the principles of our party but i hope he does it in a way that reaches across party lines
8063286 i do want to be a part of the national dialogue
8063287 to me victory must mean that al qaida and the global jihadists have no safe haven from which they can plan another attack on america but in iraq victory has to be the burden of the iraqi government and leadership itself
8063288 the american people have every right to believe that we protect our borders and we know that people are coming here legally and not coming here illegally with perhaps suspect motives
8063289 you know who the critic is today it s the kids and the people coming out of the theater text messaging and phoning with early word of mouth that and social expression groups like myspace those are key
8063290 i ve had dinner with cary grant jimmy stewart producer jack warner and young stars like johnny depp adrien brody and keira knightley i span a lot of periods and a lot of great actors but regardless there s always one thing that s at the heart of all good movies the storytelling mechanism we ve been in a storytelling environment for 25 000 years from tribal dancing around the fire to the oral tradition the bible the gutenberg press and films they all form one long connection the internet and interactive games are now extending that connection changing the methodology of storytelling and no matter the medium for the story to work it has to be compelling
8063291 it s brought in a four letter word that starts with f fear is such an omnipresent element in our business now
8063292 people spend their hard earned time and money so they want to be sure they re seeing a good movie they also want variety if they have to go to the same film over and over say rocky 12 there s no expectation of variety big event films give people a sense of certainty they know what they re getting and they already know the cast and the storyline smaller art films are acts of discovery they can surprise but very few of those small films make any real money they re a challenge for filmmakers and audiences i love them because they re usually about something they challenge my creative interest and i adore them
8063293 i m looking for a suspension of disbelief to be taken into a compelling experience that separates me from my own life whether i m quarreling with my kid or i m upset with my mother i have those two hours and that time interrupts all the cacophony in my life it takes me away makes me feel better about the world enlarges my opportunity horizon or enthuses me about living it gives me an emotional experience and that s what i take away
8063294 additionally for around 2 000 you can buy a really first class theater plasma screen surround sound hd delivery and re create the moviegoing experience at home
8063295 i went to a korean theater complex and there were kids playing on videogame machines and sports scores were posted in the lobby while they were waiting the experience made them want to come early the film of course is crucial but it s only part of the overall experience
8063296 big pictures are like thrill rides promising to give you an emotional rush but all storytelling is emotional when you go to smaller art films designed to probe your inner emotions in a thoughtful more engaging way the question then becomes whether i should get some filter on that critics discussions because the value proposition is different from the hollywood blockbuster
8063297 before you head out to see a film regardless of what you saw in an ad or a trailer know if it s targeted to your age group and taste
8063298 movies targeted to young audiences are not subjected to the same treatment
8063299 the frequency of theater attendance by an older more discriminating audience is a mere three times a year although we are seeing that number increasing while movie attendance for a young audience comes in at 16 visits per year so when a producer or director is looking at making a film which target are they going to aim for
8063300 i ve liked critics like roger ebert but is a young customer really going to listen to him and value his opinion he s a guy in his 60s and you re going to listen to what he thinks about a flick for 16 year olds not a chance
8063301 now there are millions of kids that find all the information out there the stolen clips and trailers and they give the thumbs up or down it s a whole different world and kids are driving it

8063305 later economists such as in the early nineteenth century j b say felt that smith undervalued the economic contributions of services and he did the eighteenth century had servants not a service economy it was hard for a man of that era to believe that the semi inebriated footman and the blowzy scullery maid would evolve into well the stoned pizza delivery boy and the girl behind the checkout counter with an earring in her tongue
8063306 unfortunately adam smith didnt have graphs hundreds of pages of the wealth of nations that readers skim might have been condensed into several pages that readers skip entirely another thing smith didnt have besides graphs was jargon economics was too new to have developed its thieves cant when adam smith was being incomprehensible he didnt have the luxury of brief snappy technical terms as a shorthand for incoherence he had to go on talking through his hat until the subject was and the reader would be exhausted

8063328 the second world empires and influence in the new global order
8063329 its great to be on pole position especially after the great disappointment of budapest but im well aware the race is tomorrow and so there is still a long way to go my first run in q3 was very good and on the second i made a good improvement in the first sector and thats where pole came from today the track was still very slippery partly because of last nights rain after this mornings free practice i thought the harder tyres would be the most competitive in qualifying but at the start of the session i didnt feel as comfortable anymore and so we went for the softer compound the team did a great job in preparing for this event and i want to thank them for giving me such a strong car i hope we can have a good race tomorrow
8063330 we knew we had a great car and we didnt have any problems during qualifying i felt really comfortable and i decided to qualify with the option tyre my first lap wasnt perfect and i lost almost one second compared with my second lap but on my final lap everything went well second place on the grid is a good basis for tomorrows race however felipe massa was significantly faster in the first sector and i hope well be able to improve there tomorrow our team did a great job and im confident well be strong
8063331 this was a very good qualifying for the team and me after some unlucky races lately the pace of the car here in valencia is not that bad however there is still a small gap to ferrari and mclaren qualifying went pretty smoothly with only the weather a bit unstable in the end there were only some rain drops in the second qualifying session but this did not affect the result the choice of tyres was pretty clear for me by yesterday i went on the harder compound in q1 and on the softer compound in q2 and in q3
8063332 fourth place is not what i was looking for but its definitely not the end of the world i could have been higher up the grid but on my last run in q3 i locked the wheels at a few points and lost valuable time it was nothing dramatic but at this circuit a small error is very costly i still think i can be in the fight for the win especially if i manage to get a good start we have a good car which should be especially competitive in the race
8063333 the balance of my car was good and we improved continuously throughout the sessions however im a little disappointed with my fifth place on the grid as i didnt make any mistakes and performed to the maximum its now up to us to score as many points as possible and make a good start from the cleaner side of the grid our strategy should help us to gain positions during the race
8063334 my best result ever so i am pleased as it has taken a bit of time to improve on my p7 that i did in my first grand prix its been a fantastic day for us we made some changes to the set up overnight and they all turned out to be positive the team worked hard to make the most of the data we didnt expect to do this well here but its a good thing to have both cars in q3 my last lap should have been a bit better but i made a mistake in turn 12 locking the rear under braking now we have to keep our feet on the ground because there are a lot of laps ahead of us tomorrow im looking forward to the race when i think we have a real chance to score points
8063335 after our difficult practice yesterday we completely changed my set up for today then we had a gearbox oil pump problem this morning that meant i could not try it out so in a way i was driving blind this afternoon but i used my experience i concentrated very hard and i made it through into q3 i made a mistake on my last run but i am still very happy with what we achieved today im also delighted with the way the car is developing and the fact that we can always fight for the top ten and score points that is again our target tomorrow its important and realistic and it will be an interesting race here more than anywhere anything can happen and it should be a great event
8063336 qualifying eighth is not perfect but i think it was about the maximum possible today as the fuel load comes into play in q1 i thought it was d ja vu when timo glock was in my way our team informs us on the radio how many seconds behind us a fast car is and when we have to let somebody overtake apparently this isnt the case in every team i was afraid my qualifying would be ruined but luckily i was able to do a second lap straight away and it was good enough q2 was fine as i was third fastest and could see the pace was there generally speaking im a lot happier with my car today on friday i was struggling a lot but we have made a lot of changes since
8063337 its been a few races since we managed to get into the top ten so this is a good result for us wed obviously always want to do better but this shows weve made a step in the right direction and thats satisfying we had a better understanding of where we had to improve so weve made those changes which gave us a more competitive car today we have a good strategy for the race so anything is possible today has been positive which gives me hope for points tomorrow
8063338 this wasnt bad i am still having my problem of not finding grip on the option tyre so we need to work on that but i am happy that our performance is getting better im really pleased to be in q3 for the first time its a good feeling as i kept waiting to hear that i dropped down to 11 or 12 what we have seen here is that on a new track some teams have worked in the right direction and some have not the team did a good job of giving me a car that was one of the best today now it is up to me to get the most out of it in the race its bound to be a tough race but i hope to be in a position to fight for points after making a good start
8063339 it was a good qualifying for us as both cars are close in the midfield it was a shame to miss out on q3 but actually p11 is not a bad place to start the race from because we can select our fuel level ill also be on the clean side of the track tomorrow so all in all it was a positive qualifying session for us
8063340 i am understandably disappointed with the qualifying session because i had other hopes for today the race tomorrow will therefore be more difficult but as we are on a street course anything is possible in the race we must continue working hard this evening to try and work out the best strategy that will allow us to be ready for all eventualities tomorrow such as a safety car period which seems quite likely
8063341 i dont know what went wrong but i just didnt get the lap together in the second session and that was that we definitely had the chance to be higher in the top ten but it was a difficult qualifying in the end for me the prime tyres seemed to work better but i struggled to get temperature into the tyres in the first sector of my last lap in q2 so it was just not my day today i had a heavy cold overnight and didnt feel particularly well but no excuses i think the car was good enough but it just didnt work out of course we will do our best to make up positions tomorrow there could be safety car periods so we will aim to make the most of our freedom with the strategy
8063342 weve struggled for speed for most of the weekend its a new venue here which brings variety to the positions but we dont seem to have the pace we had a few races ago which is quite frustrating there were a few laps i was pleased with but we didnt make it through to q3
8063343 i am disappointed with my qualifying and i could probably have set a better time this afternoon i dont think our result shows our true pace because fernando also failed to reach q3 when we both had the potential i will now work with my engineers and prepare for an aggressive race to move up through the field tomorrow
8063344 it was a really disappointing qualifying today particularly as we have been quick all weekend my first run on the prime tyres was good but we simply chose the wrong tyre for my final run in q1 i had no grip with the option and it just wasnt very competitive for us my final run was slower than my prime run which shouldnt happen on a circuit which is improving all the time im really disappointed as we have improved the car but today we didnt make the most of that
8063345 i expected to be able to make it through that first part of qualifying on my last run i ran wide in turn 5 and dropped about four tenths although i pulled two tenths back the net loss over the whole lap meant it wasnt enough to go through its just the way these qualifying sessionsgo that was probably one my messiest sessions and im disappointed
8063346 i really tried my hardest on that lap i think i got the maximum out of the car and the best time we could do and in the end we are only 1 3secs from the fastest time of the session it just shows how close everything is now but i dont think we could have done anything more it was a fantastic effort from the team and the car felt good it could be an unpredictable race tomorrow so lets see how it goes
8063347 it has been an incredibly frustrating day for us today we were not able to find a balance on the car in practice this morning which affected our preparations for qualifying this afternoon i particularly struggled with rear locking which cost me a lot of time as i wasnt able to attack the lap its very disappointing to be starting the first race here from so far back on the grid

8063360 it is not righteousness that you turn your faces towards east or west but it is righteousness to believe in god and the last day and the angels and the book and the messengers to spend of your substance out of love for him for your kin for orphans for the needy for the wayfarer for those who ask and for the freeing of captives to be steadfast in prayers and practice regular charity to fulfill the contracts which you made and to be firm and patient in pain or suffering and adversity and throughout all periods of panic such are the people of truth the god conscious
8063361 the most honorable among you in the sight of god is the one who is most god conscious
8063362 and vie with one another to attain to your sustainers forgiveness and to a paradise as vast as the heavens and the earth which awaits the god conscious who spend for charity in time of plenty and in time of hardship and restrain their anger and pardon their fellow men for god loves those who do good
8063363 establish regular prayer enjoin what is just and forbid what is wrong and bear patiently whatever may befall you for this is true constancy and do not swell your cheek with pride at men nor walk in insolence on the earth for god does not love any man proud and boastful and be moderate in your pace and lower your voice for the harshest of sounds indeed is the braying of the ass
8063364 my sustainer has given me nine commands to remain conscious of god whether in private or in public to speak justly whether angry or pleased to show moderation both when poor and when rich to reunite friendship with those who have broken off with me to give to him who refuses me that my silence should be occupied with thought that my looking should be an admonition and that i should command what is right
8063365 your sustainer has decreed that you worship none but him and that you be kind to parents whether one or both of them attain old age in your lifetime do not say to them a word of contempt nor repel them but address them in terms of honor and out of kindness lower to them the wing of humility and say my sustainer bestow on them your mercy even as they cherished me in childhood
8063366 and render to the relatives their due rights as also to those in need and to the traveler and do not squander your wealth in the manner of a spendthrift
8063367 he is not a believer who eats his fill when his neighbor beside him is hungry

8063369 the country is depending on democrats we must lead by eschewing politics as usual in favor of the politics of the possible
8063370 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but principalities and powers
8063371 psst hey mayor see how oil prices are cratering the hospitality industry maybe you should try something different
8063372 fat phobias are robbing americans of an essential part of eating enjoyment

8063377 sometimes you just feel a calling greater than the nfl
8063378 football is just a small part of who i am what i can be
8063379 tikis not just a star in the making hes a star a very different very talented guy who is going to go far
8063380 what weve seen from tiki the last two years is how versatile he is
8063381 we definitely hope he continues on with us but we understand theres other people interested
8063382 we really look forward to tiki tuesdays because he brings a spark
8063383 tikis a gem he has energy and is always prepared this show is very unscripted and you have to be quick on your feet but also comfortable knowing your stuff
8063384 the giants had a monday night game nov 20 at jacksonville he flew back on the team plane and got to giants stadium at 4 30 he took a car service here and did our 6 a m show on no sleep he does this because he wants it because he really loves it and hes good
8063385 the pediatrician at the time said this may limit what they can do
8063386 the seizures went away to the point where i just said whatever they want they can try
8063387 sometimes you just feel a calling greater than the nfl
8063388 im crossing over to world events entertainment sports because thats what im interested in thats what i see myself doing delving deeper being provocative
8063389 the socio economic strata are causing an enormous divide in education levels so people get stuck unless they have an inspiring event great talent or fortune there should be a way everyone should be able to benefit
8063390 i remember picking up lonesome dove when i was 14 just because it was around and i felt like i was in the wild west
8063391 nowadays kids dont read thats why ronde and i started to write three childrens books
8063392 get an 8 year old boy who hates reading but picks up a book about football and learns a lesson maybe hell get the next one then go on to read something else
8063393 it gave me an eye opening experience to the rest of the world
8063394 then on the heels of the trip to israel we had lunch with secretary of state condoleezza rice we did all these cool unique things that just gave me an appreciation for the world
8063395 they taught me to use my powers for good and that football isnt forever i know i can make a difference in some way
8063396 everything i did last year was inspired and driven because of how i wanted to pay respect to them
8063397 but last offseason i started thinking what do i want my life to be about football is just a small part of who i am what i can be
8063398 what my father saw in him 10 years ago was a young man who came to his job with the giants with tremendous enthusiasm and talent but someone unusually grounded
8063399 my father made a statement to tiki and ginny he told them yes im fortunate to be in this position but i have a responsibility to share my good fortune im sad as an owner and football fan to see him leave but im very optimistic about his future
8063400 not only is he a gifted athlete he is very intelligent has great character and is dedicated to making himself as good a player and leader as possible and doing the same for his team you dont come across many tiki barbers in your career and when you have one you are very grateful
8063401 may be in my rear view a little bit but its still my job and i care about doing it really well
8063402 tell them what they cant do then get out of their way
8063403 theyve always approached life with the attitude im going to take advantage of the opportunity to do something different that can also make a difference
8063404 anything we put our mind to were passionate about achieving
8063405 were still the same two kids who grew up together and were still living through each other
8063406 were excited for our kids to be here theres tons of different things for them to do
8063407 theyre like groupies of this little band theyve been listening to since they were 1
8063408 earl campbell is 51 and cant walk twenty years from now i dont want to be that way
8063409 its like listening in on a phone conversation between us
8063410 as soon as he walks in the door he gets on the massage table for three four hours
8063411 so even though hes very busy he doesnt sacrifice what he needs to do to get ready for sunday
8063412 the first game after it came out that i was retiring roy williams came up to me afterward and said tiki im going to miss you
8063413 roys my arch rival things like that show me players respect me and understand my decision and are generally happy and proud of me that means a lot
8063414 former giant and current bears punter brad maynard said im going to miss watching you play the reaction has been extreme respect
8063415 ive had a good opportunity the last couple of years with brandon to talk to him about the things ive learned and my approach towards football and things in life that transcend football
8063416 jason bell one of our defensive backs his locker is two down from mine
8063417 he said tiki i want to give you a call in the offseason
8063418 he said im from the hood i want to get myself in a more polished way and start thinking about other things off the field
8063419 even though guys dont understand what i do or why i do what i do they want to emulate it
8063420 i watch tiki on the fox morning show and im going wow
8063421 hes playing football while hes doing that show man i admire that
8063422 hes taken a different approach to this than most ex athletes tikis setting the bar really high
8063423 tiki gets pro bowl honors but for a new york athlete its amazing that he doesnt really get the credit he deserves
8063424 hes just a great player hes gotten faster better and bigger as the years have gone on thats not something that happens hes defied all the rules when it comes to running backs
8063425 a lot of it is hard work hes forged a hall of fame career i hope he gets his honors i just hope for all of our sakes he gets a super bowl championship first
8063426 tiki has the rare ability of someone in a game of talented individuals to look ahead
8063427 maybe theres a parallel to his vision and him finding a hole on the field he also knew he had to find the next hole ahead in his life
8063428 hes relentless about learning his ascension in the nfl is similar to what hell be in the news business as he went from good to great player to elite player
8063429 nbcs matt lauer is the guy he wants to strive to emulate down the road as he gets better and better in the broadcasting industry
8063430 no professional athlete has ever done anything like tiki is trying not only will broadcasting be the linchpin of his future the deal will be a hybrid deal in so far as its going to be a news and sports deal definitely a morning show deal but it will also entail other aspects of news
8063431 i met tiki in 1997 when he was a backup and i represented a backup offensive lineman jerry reynolds jerry said you want to get to know this guy this guys different tikis unusual the guys just done it on another level
8063432 tiki sustained a bad knee injury when he was 12 years old
8063433 it was terrible he was doing something he had no business doing riding his bike around a construction site that was clearly marked he and ronde rode through the construction site and tiki got too close to the edge and he and his bike went over a 30 foot drop
8063434 tikis sitting on the gurney inside the hospital er and i said what happened
8063435 they were waiting for the surgeon to come i walked over and looked underneath the sheet and tikis kneecap is sitting up on top of his knee totally out of place
8063436 i said to myself ok i dont need to see this
8063437 the surgeon told me he probably wont play contact sports and hell probably have arthritis
8063438 to see him now youd never know every now and then he does get the arthritis
8063439 tikis taken some heat lately for being narcissistic and selfish about his decision
8063440 hes taken the hit he just wants to win what i sincerely hope kids will take from his decision is that you dont have to be what everyone thinks you are
8063441 if i had allowed the surgeon to tell me that hell never walk straight again and he shouldnt have played sports it would have broken his spirit
8063442 tikis always been very open minded he absolutely thrives on a challenge
8063443 both of my kids are phenomenal fathers i know he wants to be a part of his sons lives not just on weekends he wants to be there to watch them be kids
8063444 its been neat watching tiki emerge in the new york arena where you have a lot of opportunities a lot of people can only dream of having thats what im proudest of how hes taken advantage of those opportunities
8063445 im not obsessed with being an nfl player i never have been

8063449 wall street is about to launch a new way to trade professional athletes the way you trade stocks a piece of tiger anyone
8063450 the fans have always had an emotional investment without a legal financial one
8063451 this is taking emotion and putting it to financial use screw this putting 300 bucks into a pot at work this is everyone get online and open your account at ameritrade the fans will be in the same position as the owners of sports teams they ll be making money off the players or losing money on them they ll just have more flexibility than the owners
8063452 my newspaper this morning has two and a half pages of business news and 17 pages of sports the day after the game you know peyton manning s thumb is hurt what do you know about the c e o of i b m
8063453 is that we re not even measuring the right things on the court
8063454 econometrics is a very good background for what we do
8063455 as the market grows and the liquidity and sophistication of institutional investors increase there will be trading products that require more sophisticated analysis and we ll need to truly quantify the value of an assist that leads to a dunk versus an assist that leads to a 5 foot jumper or the value a running back should receive for a 3 yard run versus an 8 yard run compared with the value received by the offensive line
8063456 this market will be corrupted by the passion of sports fans it ll be much dumber than the ordinary market
8063457 smart people will be interested in this because stupid people will
8063458 great in the beginning i ll just short every player
8063459 you can t allow a pro athlete to cash out 20 percent of himself it will reduce his incentive to try
8063460 you ll create a chance for athletes to make money by betting against themselves
8063461 hes a 37 year old dog for f cks sake
8063462 do gooders are always harping on about education in kids tv so scoobs gets the customary one way ticket to doggy heaven which the episode will be sure to point out doesnt exist
8063463 in real life a 37 year old hound would almost certainly be immobile incontinent and would probably make an awful mess of the carpet
8063464 and hed have died of massive organ failure around 1982 at the latest

8063466 they could at least have had shaggy accidentally backing over him in the mystery machine
8063467 i think thats how hed most want to go other than on the job with daphne
8063468 i guess it started early in the 60s shaggy was always looking for a new high apparently being chased by idiots in cheap costumes no longer was giving shaggy the rush he needed soon he found scooby snacks and it didnt take long for him to turn scooby on to them
8063469 its okay if you dont think its worth it you can tell me if you change

8063491 the united states condemns the decision by the russian president to recognize as independent states the georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia
8063492 no pact or an agreement should be set without being based on full sovereignty national common interests and no foreign soldier should remain on iraqi land and there should be a specific deadline and it should not be open

8063495 a slave does not conceal the faults of another in this world except that allah conceals his faults on the day of resurrection
8063496 if you seek after the shameful deeds of others you will bring them to ruin or almost do so
8063497 whoever sees someone elses shame and conceals it is like a person who rescued a newborn girl from being buried alive
8063498 the believers with each other are like a building each part supporting the others

8063518 allahs messenger peace be upon him said to me gabriel recites peace upon you so i said and upon him be peace and the mercy of allah and his blessings
8063519 if you enter upon your family greet them with peace a greeting from allah that is blessed and good
8063520 i see this as directing towards the statement of allah
8063521 if a man enters his house and mentions the name of allah upon entering and upon eating satan says you have no lodgings for me and no dinner
8063522 o allah verily i ask you for the best entry and the best departure in allahs name we enter and with allahs name we leave and upon allah we put our trust
8063523 in the name of allah i believe in allah rely upon allah and put my trust in allah o allah verily i seek refuge with you from falling astray or leading others astray from stumbling into error or causing others to fall into error from being oppressed or oppressing others and from being ignorant or facing the ignorance of others
8063524 whoever says when leaving from his house in the name of allah i put my trust in allah there is no might or power except with allah then it will be said to him you are sufficed you are protected you have been guided and you are saved from satan
8063525 and satan says to another devil how can you reach a man who has been guided sufficed and protected
8063526 the blessings of food are in the washing before it and the washing after it
8063527 whoever wishes to increase the good of his household should wash when food is served and when getting up from eating
8063528 mention allahs name eat with your right hand and eat what is right in front of you
8063529 in the name of allah the first and the last of it
8063530 praise be to allah abundant praise that is good and blessed a never ending praise that we shall never bid farewell to or dispense with o our lord
8063531 allahs messenger peace be upon him had never once criticized food if he liked it he ate it and if he disliked it he left it
8063532 i was a young boy in the home of allahs messenger peace be upon him and my hand used to move all around the platter so allahs messenger peace be upon him said o young man eat with your right hand and eat from what is in front of you
8063533 when one of you finishes eating food he should not wipe his fingers until after he licks them
8063534 you do not know where the blessings in your food lie
8063535 when we were dining in the company of allahs messenger peace be upon him we would not reach out toward the food with our hands until allahs messenger peace be upon him did so first
8063536 may fasting people break their fasts with you may the pious people share your food and may the angels pray for you
8063537 none of you should drink in one gulp the way the camel drinks instead drink in two or three sips mention allahs name when you drink and praise allah when you have finished
8063538 do not drink directly from the waterskin or the jug
8063539 whoever drinks from gold or silver vessels merely pours into his stomach the fire of hell
8063540 the son of dam fills no container worse than his stomach it is sufficient for the son of dam to eat what will keep him standing straight if he must eat more then a third of his stomach for food a third for drink and a third for air
8063541 the one who serves drink to a group of people should be the last one to drink
8063542 drink should be passed to the right then to the next one to the right
8063543 verily these places are occupied so if one of you enters the bathroom he should say o allah verily i seek refuge with you from the male and female devils
8063544 he prophet muhammad peace be upon him used to seek refuge as an act of worship he did so out loud in order to teach others
8063545 a barrier is placed between the eyes of the jinn and the shameful parts of the human being when a person mentions allahs name before entering the bathroom
8063546 our scholars say that it is preferable to recite this formula of remembrance whether one is inside a structure or out in the middle of the desert our scholars say that it is preferable to first say in the name of allah then add o allah verily i seek refuge with you from the male and female devils after he leaves the bathroom he should say i seek your pardon then say praise be to allah who has allowed me to enjoy its good flavor has retained within me its nourishment and removed from me its harm
8063547 be wary of the three curses passing excrement in places where people congregate in the middle of the road or in places of shade
8063548 the one who relieves himself where people walk and the one who does so where people take shade
8063549 do not let your urine come in contact with you because it is the primary reason for punishment in the grave
8063550 when one of you drinks he should not breathe into the drinking vessel and when one of you urinates he should not hold his penis in his right hand nor should he clean himself with his right hand
8063551 when you go to relieve yourselves do not face the qiblah nor turn your back to it but instead face another direction
8063552 when we came to syria we found that some of the bathrooms were built in the direction of the ka bah so we did our best to turn from its direction and sought allahs forgiveness
8063553 o allah i have submitted myself to you and turned my face towards you and left my affairs to you and i entrusted you with my concerns hoping from you and fearing you there is no salvation or refuge from you except with you i believe in your book that you have sent down and in your prophet whom you have sent
8063554 whoever says this before sleeping then dies during the night has died on the pure and natural way
8063555 praise be to allah who has given me life after causing me to die and to him is the final gathering
8063556 o allah save me from your punishment on the day that you resurrect your servants
8063557 if one of you goes to his bed he should take the lower part of his garment and brush off his bed with it and mention the name of allah because he has no idea what might have gotten into his bed after he got up from it
8063558 whoever has dirty hands and goes to sleep without washing them and something happens to him like being bitten or stung by an animal then he has no one to blame but himself
8063559 do not leave the fires in your house burning when you go to sleep
8063560 fire is an enemy of yours so when you go to sleep put it out
8063561 close the doors tie shut your waterskins cover your dishes and extinguish your lamps for verily satan cannot open that which is closed nor enter that which is tied nor uncover the dishes and verily the little mischief maker the rat might knock the flame and set fire to the people in their homes
8063562 this is a way of lying down that allah despises
8063563 when you go to your bed perform your ablutions like you would for prayer then lay down on your right side then say o allah i have submitted myself to you and make it the last thing you say
8063564 eat drink wear clothing and give in charity without being extravagant or stingy
8063565 cleanliness calls to faith and faith accompanies the one who possesses it to paradise
8063566 you are coming to your brothers so put your saddles and your clothing right so you will be a pleasant sight for the people for verily allah does not like filth and filthiness
8063567 if allah has given you wealth let us see on you the effects of allahs blessings and generosity
8063568 what is it to a person if he has the means to reserve two garments for friday other than his work clothes
8063569 isnt this better than one of you coming with disheveled hair like a devil
8063570 allahs messenger peace be upon him used to like to start with his right side in all of his activities in cleansing caring for his hair and putting on his shoes
8063571 when one of you puts on his shoes he should start with his right foot and when he takes them off he should start with his left so that the right foot will be the first to be placed in the shoes and the last to be removed from them
8063572 if a man enters his house and mentions the name of allah upon entering and upon eating then satan says you have no lodgings for me and no dinner
8063573 o allah praise is for you you have clothed me with this i ask you for the good in it and the good that it was made for and i seek refuge with you from the evil in it and the evil that it was made for
8063574 the prophet peace be upon him took silk in his right hand and gold in his left hand and said verily these two things are forbidden to the men folk among my followers
8063575 allahs messenger peace be upon him prohibited us from drinking and eating from silver vessels from wearing silk and from sitting upon it
8063576 whoever wears ostentatious clothing will be dressed by allah in humiliating clothing on the day of judgment
8063577 whoever drags his garment pridefully allah will not look at him on the day of judgment
8063578 whoever leaves off certain clothing out of humility for allah in spite of being able to wear it allah will call him out from among the people on the day of judgment and offer him the choice of whichever adornments of faith he wishes to wear
8063579 allah curses the one who administers a tattoo and the one who receives it and the one who makes gaps between and shortens anothers teeth and the one who has it done to them
8063580 to feed the poor and to greet with peace both those you know and those that you do not know
8063581 there are over seventy branches of faith the greatest of which is saying there is no god but allah and the least of which is removing an obstacle from the road
8063582 o messenger of allah we have no option but to be on the roads and speak to each other therein
8063583 if you must assemble on the roads then give the road its rights
8063584 lowering ones gaze preventing injury returning the greeting of peace enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong
8063585 allah is good and loves goodness he is pure and love cleanliness he is most kind and loves kindness he is generous and loves generosity so clean your courtyards
8063586 if one of the women should go to the mosque she should not touch perfume
8063587 o allah illuminate my heart illuminate my tongue illuminate my hearing illuminate my sight illuminate what is behind me and what is before me illuminate what is above me and what is below me o allah grant me illumination
8063588 when one of you enters the mosque he should offer salutations upon the prophet peace be upon him then he should say o allah open to me the doors of your mercy upon leaving the mosque he should say o allah i ask of you your grace
8063589 once while we were praying with allahs messenger peace be upon him we heard the noise of men after he finished praying he said what is the matter with you they replied we were hurrying to prayer he said do not do this when you come to prayer do so with proper composure perform whatever part of the prayer you catch and complete whatever you miss
8063590 when one of you goes to the mosque he should perform two units of prayer before sitting down
8063591 o allah bestow your forgiveness peace and blessings upon our master muhammad my lord forgive me my sins and open for me the doors of your grace
8063592 these mosques are not places for urinating and leaving filth they are but for the remembrance of allah prayer and reading qur n
8063593 whoever hears a man asking in the mosque about something that he lost say to him may allah not return it to you because mosques were not built for this purpose
8063594 whoever you see reciting poetry in the mosque say to him three times may allah beset your mouth with affliction

8063667 title come see usa todays medal tables for the athens and beijing olympics recently there have been a lot of discussions about how to rank countries on their medal haul per gold or total medals some people insist that americans have always ranked countries according to total medals i checked out the usa today and here are the results bxbq does not know how to include pictures in a post screen shot of the different ways of ranking medal counts clearly demonstrate american double standard
8063668 how do americans really rank countries on their olympic medals
8063669 chinas haul of 51 gold medals was the largest since the soviet union won 55 in seoul in 1988 fielding athletes groomed since childhood in sports academies it won medals in 25 different sports including its first ever in sailing beach volleyball and field hockey

8063765 sure the berlin wall has fallen but its still in our minds juliane told me one time in hamburg west germany feel an aversion for eastern germany because of taxes theyre paying the east to grow its economy
8063766 east germany now has a crisis in boserup erik told me a lot of young people move from east to west and they are losing workers
8063767 they think about themselves that they are the most important in europe never smiling you will never drink with them normally and the worst thing in germany is the police
8063768 i immediately sent them nachui without going any deeper they met each other for the first time but their opinion that germany is the worst country in europe was similar like two drops of water
8063769 but police are not liked without reason you from the east always steal our cars my sister once went on holiday to lithuania and somenone stole her car your image here is like a car thiefs if it would be about anything else maybe our relationship would be better but now we are talking about cars its a sacred thing in germany we say that germans love their cars more than their wifes

8063772 what you can do to verify he kexins age on subjectivity and procedural justice
8063773 chinese authorities thought it was more important to win than to follow the rules
8063774 at the 2000 sydney olympics three years after the minimum age was raised to 16 in gymnastics chinese gymnast yang yun competed and won a bronze medal in the uneven bars coincidentally this event is also hes specialty yangs passport said she was born on december 24 1984 and turning 16 in the year of the games making her eligible she later confessed in a television interview that she was only 14 at the time of the competition and that she and her coaches had lied about her age as in the case of yang yun the existing records prior to the olympics local registries athletic records and news articles were all correct whereas the documentation she showed olympic officials to confirm her eligibility proved to be false it is no coincidence that he kexins passport was issued on february 14 2008 a mere 6 months before the olympics
8063775 bxbq yet again going off on some rant about how whitey is unstable and aggressive
8063776 the claim that kexin looks too young to be 16 and therefore must be investigated is meaningless and frivolous
8063777 because the chinese government and i say there is nothing to investigate
8063778 maybe christine ohuruogu should be stripped of her medals that doesnt make this particular case any less valid its not fair when any athlete cheats and just because one athlete has found a way to get around the rules that doesnt mean that another athlete should be let off the hook
8063779 the chinese passport is valid evidence the internet records intriguing as they are are not admissible as evidence this may be a piece of technicality however procedural justice relies on technicality
8063780 and until then he kexin is presume to be innocent of the allegation
8063781 no more balance beam until we change those diapers sweety
8063782 the international olympics committee ioc has found no proof that chinese gymnast he kexin was underage
8063783 let him who are without sin cast the first stone
8063784 even to you for if it didnt matter why would you fools be attemping to move the mountain here
8063785 from my extensive experience of living and working in the west once you show your weakness the average westerner will find it extremely hard to restrain himself and the whole thing will escalate
8063786 but if some of you want to keep on investigating because you have some unhealthy fascination with certain personal information about these girls whom you consider under aged then shame on you
8063787 a passport is ordinarily sufficient as proof of age but if a the athlete subjectively looks younger than the eligible age b any newspaper or website article or other piece of writing without any proof as to the accuracy of the newspaper or website article or other piece of writing is presented that indicates that the age shown on the passport is inaccurate and c there are complaints raised in the media the ioc shall conduct an investigation of the athlete and shall at its discretion determine the acceptability of the evidence offered as proof of age
8063788 fairness requires that the same standards should be applied to each athlete
8063789 we will accept normal proof but where there are doubts such as was the case with nth korea some of the eastern block countries in previous olympics we reserve the right to look a little deeper in order to protect the reputation of the olympics
8063790 the fig asked china for documents on he kexin yang yilin jiang yuyuan deng linlin and li shanshan and said saturday that it had received passports id cards and family residence permits and would begin analyzing them the ioc however sounded as if it did not expect anything to be found
8063791 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
8063792 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
8063793 cheating works so if we cheated you you should just accept it
8063794 what is interesting to me is how the truth gets to be the
8063795 cheating works so if we cheated you you should just accept it
8063796 a culture of crybabies the 21st century world of wimps whiners and victims
8063797 when the world was officially introduced to he kexin this week even those unwise to the ways of competitive gymnastics could tell that with he something was not right at 4 foot 8 inches tall and weighing 72 pounds the beijing native appears significantly younger than most of her chinese teammates much less her american and european counterparts
8063798 remember 911 have been used to justify the cruelest treatment of mexicans cubans japanese muslims and middle easterners
8063799 asians wouldnt be so badly portrayed in the american media if they only behaved better
8063800 the media portrayals are wrong lets expose and challenge their faulty underpinnings and change them
8063801 i dont know the ages of he kexin jiang yuyuan and yang yilin they may not even know at this point but i do know that calendar age isnt the real issue here physical age is forget 14 or 16 physically these girls couldnt even pass for 12 they have no hips and no breasts from all outward appearances they havent even hit puberty
8063802 it is a sad reality that americans view asians chinese in prejudiced stereotypical ways

8063805 the bush plan is a hoax it will neither reduce gas prices nor increase energy independence it just gives millions more acres to the same companies that are sitting on nearly 68 million acres of public lands and coastal areas
8063806 if the president wants to bring down prices in the next two weeks not the next two decades he should free our oil by releasing a small portion of the more than 700 million barrels of oil we have put in the strategic petroleum reserve
8063807 its time to tell the oil industry you already have millions of acres to drill

8063811 making such changes needs a lot of co operation and we would especially like to thank the indonesian minister of youth and sport affairs dr adhyaksa dault and imi the national motorsports federation for consenting to this date change
8063812 our welcome in china has always been extremely warm and it is very gratifying that we have been invited to race at our fourth different track in this amazing country by the chinese government the chinese fans are some of the most passionate as can be seen by their support for the series and a1 team china also as we have seen with the recent olympics china knows how to put on great events
8063813 it is a great honour to have a1gp back in china especially with the new a1gp powered by ferrari cars the severity of the earthquake in sichuan province on the 12 may this year was a shock to everyone worldwide and both a1gp and a1 team china will take this opportunity to show support for the local people who have suffered so badly i am sure the fans in chengdu will be able to show they are getting on with their lives and will give a1gp a warm welcome
8063814 this guy girl hit on me i said i was straight but not narrow and it was totally chill

8063827 a youngster might hear a parent say share your wagon with john but what shes really thinking is my mom wants me to give up this wagon no way sharing is too vague of a concept for young children to understand and it is best used only when a child has lots of something to distribute like popcorn a better phrase to use is taking turns it can be suggested that a child give his friend a turn with a toy after he himself has had a substantial amount of time to plat with it first its not fair to immediately impose taking turns right after a child has picked up a toy dont pounce on him he deserves a few minutes of uninterrupted time and space to play it gives his brain a chance to process what hes doing

8063863 the coat of armor is none other than mine and i do not consider the commander of the faithful to be a liar
8063864 the coat of armor is in his possession this gives him an apparent right over it do you have any evidence to support your claim
8063865 as for myself i bear witness that these are the laws of the prophets the commander of the faithful takes me to the judge and he rules in my favor against him i bear witness that there is no god but allah and that muhammad is his messenger the coat of armor is yours o commander of the faithful i was following behind your army while you were departing from siff n and i came up from behind your multi hued camel

8063874 if he is working to support his small children then it is for the sake of allah if he is working to support his elderly parents then it is for the sake of allah if he is working to occupy himself and keep his desires in check then it is for the sake of allah if on the other hand he is doing so to show off and earn fame then he is working for the sake of satan
8063875 my lord show me how you bring the dead to life
8063876 yes but i ask for the contentment of my heart
8063877 take four birds and train them to come to you then place a portion of them on every mountain then call them they will come to you swiftly
8063878 the best struggle jihad is to speak the truth in front of an unjust king
8063879 to allahs messenger the leaders of the muslims and the masses
8063880 you are a man with the habits of the time of ignorance the child of a white woman has no preference over the child of a black woman the only preference is by piety or good deeds
8063881 o people those who came before you came to ruin only because whenever a noble committed theft they would pardon him but whenever a weak person did so they would carry out the punishment by allah if f timah the daughter of muhammad committed theft i would cut off her hand
8063882 if a man say i love god and hateth his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love god whom he hath not seen

8063892 the decision will require us to make some extremely difficult decisions
8063893 unless life or limb is in immediate jeopardy or sexual abuse is about to occur
8063894 what we didnt need to do was raise the white flag in a memo to every cps worker to simply protect cps rather than protect children
8063895 you have to have a safe place apart from the family to successfully interview a child and find out what happened
8063896 although the changes which are necessary are substantial and call for a rapid transition this in no way lessens our commitment to do what is in the best interest of each individual child in each individual circumstance
8063897 the whole reason we started the litigation was because we felt there were wrongs in the system
8063898 a chance to stop and think whether there is something that can be done that is less traumatic to the child
8063899 in that way the government may ensure that everyones interests are considered and the least amount of harm will come to the children the government seeks to protect as well as their parents
8063900 by virtue of the anointing i can say what i want when i want to who i want i refuse to judge or be judged and will judge anyone who judges me as unsaved
8063901 you are passing off your own interpretation of what may have happened as if it is biblical not so as doug rightly said this officially has to be the worst excuse for a prophecy not coming to pass ever
8063902 this is just another tactic hyper charismatics in particular use to shut you up there were no claims to us being god but once again you have attempted to bring distortions to the table we have shown you scriptures showing that we are to judge jesus himself told us to
8063903 is because as i and others who have come out of the charismatic movement have noticed within most pentecostal circles you are made to feel like you cannot question the
8063904 dont judge let god deal with him let god be god and be the final judge
8063905 and say yes to the biblical view of testing all things
8063906 the best guy in the country richard clarke got demoted

8063908 we dramatize the war of 1812 because no ones alive but why do journalists make things up about 9 11
8063909 led the way in harnessing technology to prevent another attack
8063910 spence abraham was the right man in the right place after 9 11
8063911 the terrorists hijacked u s technology and turned it against us spence led the way in harnessing technology to prevent another attack
8063912 secretary abraham was responsible for some of the most critical and potentially dangerous facilities on u s soil as a director of icx technologies he will now help guide our development of next generation security technologies
8063913 we wanted someone with an ageless beauty who would appeal to women of all ages she isnt edgy she isnt going to scare anybody off
8063914 for i owneth malibu and thou lookest a bit jewish unto me
8063915 i have opened my mouth and stirred up the jews
8063916 thou didst not look jewish when i was besotted with drink even so gettest me out of this place of desolation
8063917 whereupon we hath interest in this project we thereupon now hath none
8063918 what hast thou done that thy father is proud of thee he yelpeth for joy
8063919 the jews have started this war as they have all the wars
8063920 and hath entered unto the land of rehab there to rend his garments and gnash his teeth and donate to bnai brith
8063921 shoppest thou not nor giveth money unto the jews for they owneth enough as it is
8063922 we are in the land of very deep doo doo wherefromunto it ith difficult to extricate
8063923 if another centurion pulleth me over i shall say unto him shalom and kiss his hiney
8063924 truly thou art radioactive though we would distribute thy new movie apocalypto
8063925 mel offereth to change the name of his movie to
8063926 why did we bankroll thou to make a movie about guatemalans dipped in flour who green lighted this abomination let him be brought forth that he may be recircumcised without novocain
8063927 i met none in rehab for they hath not time to drink being busy in the starting of wars
8063928 in a country as complicated as iraq there are no simple answers
8063929 he looked like a house walking into a bigger house
8063930 we had a black son before we had a democrat friend
8063931 i dont know that hed ever even held a bible
8063932 it was like god made a child just for us
8063933 we know there are hezbollah terrorists here in the united states
8063934 i wanted to look at the different ways in which care is given to the very rich and the very poor
8063935 its a single lead show with a supporting cast of doctors who are essential to the show and all have their own stories
8063936 its not as evenly divided as the storylines on er but not as focused on one character as house
8063937 coming up with a new tv hospital drama is a challenge but i dont think its impossible
8063938 its been seven years since i left er and medicine has changed in so many ways
8063939 i wanted to do something different and look at the different ways in which care is given to the very rich and the very poor
8063940 my personal experience after seven years of involvement with lamp type production server environments is that the free community distributions of many well respected open source products are so good that they rarely if ever required paid support

8063953 her death was unintentional and that it was an accident
8063954 women today are charting new territory i cant wait to connect with them
8063955 ive seen it all from the toxic bachelor to the happily betrothed from the modelizers to mr big women today are charting new territory balancing busy careers with their families and trying to find time for the all the relationships in their lives i cant wait to connect with them on the air after writing extensively about these topics i am thrilled to make the leap from the page to the radio my show fits right in with the smart definitive programming sirius has for women
8063956 sex and the city opened the floodgates for women everywhere to talk with candor and humor about men sex and relationships
8063957 in candaces trademark clever and witty style she will address the interpersonal and professional issues that matter to women most and sometimes scare men
8063958 the administrations proposals if adopted by congress would almost surely pass muster with the supreme court
8063959 congress may not have complete carte blanche but in the hamdan case last june four of the justices who voted against the commissions stressed that the president could always go back to congress to get the authority he wanted
8063960 at nuremberg there was no secret evidence and no closed proceedings that the defendants counsel was excluded from although its not clear how much physical access to the evidence the individual defendants had
8063961 hearsay and evidence produced by coercive methods werent formally excluded by the nuremberg charter but the american interrogators didnt do rough stuff like water boarding although there might have been a corner or two cut that the coercion standard would find troubling
8063962 the trials shouldnt differ fundamentally from the fair trial provisions in any trial especially when you have the potential death penalty or life in prison
8063963 to exclude a defendant from any part of the trial or to withhold evidence from the defendant seems to me by any civilized standard outside what is acceptable
8063964 the other objectionable provision is that evidence would be admitted even if obtained under duress or torture
8063965 in a war situation international commissions often use hearsay as long as its reliable
8063966 was later found during the investigation of the african embassy bombings
8063967 the republican moderates proposal would come a lot closer to satisfying international opinion and in part because its coming from the senate and not the administration
8063968 guantanamo is now a rallying cry in europe so any trials that take place there will be tainted by that fact alone
8063969 the administration would be well advised to allow the proceedings to be televised to avoid the image of a show trial
8063970 theres always a danger that this will degenerate into a political circus
8063971 slobodan milosevic used the trial against him as a political platform and saddam hussein is doing the same thing the more procedural rights you give the defendant the more you allow him to continue the war by other means
8063972 you can clamp down on access but you do so at the cost of the perception of fairness and finding the right balance of fairness and control is very hard
8063973 an editor from glamour wanted me to write a short story for them so i send them dora on the beach and they liked it but the main character was too old for their target audience so i told them i had this idea for a story about a woman who comes across her exs online wedding registry based on my experience of surfing www theweddingchannel com for the name of every guy i ever dated i mean what did god make the internet for if you cant check up on your ex
8063974 youre done with it you can write a good short story in a couple of weeks but with a novel youre at least im stuck with that baby for a year but the hard part is you have to think about the details that you use to get your point across in 20 pages vs 400
8063975 also im desperately clinging to youth at 36 with a 3 year old im trying to stave off the inevitable myspace was cheaper than plastic surgery
8063976 the shepherd the angel and walter the christmas miracle dog
8063977 iraqis must not jump on the anti israel arab bandwagon
8063978 destruction that happened to the lebanese people as a result of the military air and ground attacks
8063979 iraqis need to understand that they must not jump on the anti israel arab bandwagon not for israels sake but for themselves the arab obsession with israel has been debilitating for the arab world and has been the primary excuse for tolerating dictatorships and terrorism some brave arabs have said this also why should iraq line up with syria and the hardliners when even the saudis are criticizing hezbollah
8063980 what the young boys of the party of god did to beirut a generation earlier was now replicated in baghdad the half educated and the bewildered and the opportunistic found their way to sadrs army
8063981 if we do not provide this exception israels defense minister who was born in iraq could return here and run for prime minister
8063982 its not that we are anti semitic but in parts of our community if it gets out that iraqi jews israelis could return there will be uproar
8063983 are there more radical islamic terrorists because of the war in iraq
8063984 history has given us both a tragedy and an opportunity
8063985 my father is jewish my mother is jewish i am jewish
8063986 why do men fall asleep after sex more questions youd only ask a doctor after your third whiskey sour
8063987 why do i sneeze when i look in the sun
8063988 a devastating challenge to the global culture of human rights established almost 60 years ago we are sleepwalking into a surveillance society
8063989 i wish i didnt have a dad i wish i had goldfish
8063990 i wish i didnt have a dad i wish i had
8063991 hes a really good guy ive seen how hes acted on television hes a good role model
8063992 if you place you get your picture taken with apolo thats my goal
8063993 i speak at a lot of events but this is the first time ive run in one this year
8063994 im cross training right now biking running lifting weights jumping
8063995 ill be at the 2010 olympics at vancouver british columbia one way or the other
8063996 im marketing myself for short track skating i want to make sure we have the right kind of funding countries like canada china and korea get great funding for speed skating
8063997 we went to lou holtzs book signing in fayetteville two weeks ago
8063998 the greatest threat to global stability since the cuban missile crisis
8063999 the nations were caught in a trap a trap made during the first thirty days out of battles that failed to be decisive a trap from which there was and has been no exit
8064000 starkest warning black and george tenet had given the white house
8064001 what i am quite certain of is that i would remember if i was told as this account apparently says that there was about to be an attack in the united states and the idea that i would somehow have ignored that i find incomprehensible
8064002 i dont know that this meeting took place but what i really dont know what im quite certain of is that it was not a meeting in which i was told there was an impending attack and i refused to respond
8064003 it kind of doesnt ring true that you have to shock me into something i was very involved in
8064004 showing the increasing likelihood that al qaeda would soon attack the united states
8064005 tenet and black felt they were not getting through to rice
8064006 i remember that george was very worried and he expressed that
8064007 we were all very worried because the threat reporting was quite intense the problem was that it was also quite nebulous
8064008 the great escape nine jews who fled hitler and changed the world
8064009 its pretty much what you would find in my body or yours
8064010 there is very little information on the level of harm if any to humans from almost all these chemicals at small levels
8064011 only recently have labs even been able to detect these levels
8064012 a part per million is like taking a credit card and putting it on a football field
8064013 its a very useful way to report complex stories about science
8064014 its somewhat of a gimmick of course but its a gimmick that has a real use
8064015 a lot of these chemicals i could have picked up in other places but its a bit odd
8064016 airplanes are drenched in flame retardants and we want them to be
8064017 thats part of the story here our whole civilization now is based on chemicals
8064018 if some of these chemicals are dangerous and we discover that we need to design new ones the issue here is being concerned not alarmed but really wanting to know more
8064019 although self billed as an investigative humorist orourkes dispatches convey far more understanding and insight than more serious toned pontificating
8064020 wherever theres injustice oppression and suffering america will show up six months later and bomb the country next to where its happening
8064021 why are the people in the middle east so crazy here at the pyramids was an answer from the earliest days of civilization people have always been crazy
8064022 french ideas french beliefs and french actions form a sort of lodestone for humanity a moral compass needle needs a butt end wherever direction france is pointing toward collaboration with nazis accommodation with communists existentialism jerry lewis or a un resolution veto we can go the other way with a quiet conscience
8064023 if a reason for invading iraq was needed felony interior decorating would have sufficed
8064024 coming from a lower class midwestern background in one sense i do like madonna there were hundreds of those girls in my high school trashy girls all of them now living in double wide trailers if theyre lucky weighing 300 pounds and with five or six kids by five or six different fathers its nice that one of them made it to the top
8064025 a libertarian is a conservative with an acknowledged vice like say a teenage girlfriend
8064026 i tell you every election its a reluctant march to the polls for me i hate to vote of course we have to do it we have to vote otherwise the person our spouse was voting for would win
8064027 why are we so unhappy are we depressed by lowered expectations of some kind back in the 1960s i expected permanent woodstock a whole lifetime of sitting in the mud smoking mexican ditch weed listening to amplifier feedback and pawing a long island orthodontists daughter who thought she was a witch show me somebody with expectations lower than that
8064028 i once spoke to a group about gun control and an englishwoman said what luck do you think a group of uneducated rednecks would have defending themselves against the government with all of its guns and its planes and tanks
8064029 with paul konerko up one out and the bases loaded sit down you should be standing up
8064030 paul konerko was up and she couldnt see and you didnt do anything
8064031 would you please just turn around and we can go back to having a good time
8064032 lets chat lets have a good talk or anything else you want to do
8064033 dont be bothered by him peter hes just a tiny tiny man who has to pick fights to make himself feel better about his awful sad little life
8064034 how many nuclear bombs are you going to send anywhere five ten
8064035 i think that business is the most powerful force in the country
8064036 when business starts using its voice for the benefit of the country as a whole not just in its narrow self interest it can really be the force that can make the changes that need to be made
8064037 as long as the company is going to do meaningful actions that have a strong social benefit im happy to support it and help
8064038 there was always the commitment on the part of ben amp jerrys and unilever post acquisition to honor the social mission and to do things that are true to the social mission
8064039 what got lost over time initially was that ben and jerry had not just honored the social mission they had committed themselves to being leaders had committed themselves to being activists ben amp jerrys was less courageous for a period of time post acquisition
8064040 keep unilever on the outer edge of its comfort zone
8064041 there are times we keep them at their outer edge and there are times they think we are pushing them over the edge
8064042 macfarlanes voice alongside the other popular talent on board seth green mila kunis alex borstein and adam west will definitely bring the humorous story and animated world of family guy to life in this must have game for fans of the show
8064043 so i feel the pain and then move on thats my process
8064044 but ive lived a lot of life since then i always knew i would bounce back i heard all of the bad stuff but i just kept thinking its a matter of time and persistence i also thought those people dont know how ive trained they dont know me when the dust settles theres a sense of clarity and people can see who you are
8064045 you have to have fire you have to have a dream and some kind of drive and vision to propel you on
8064046 i get cast all the time as the solid lawyer the solid cop so its a pleasure to evoke my dark side especially when its for fun
8064047 it hurt equally with each man but i think eventually it helped me to feel more ok with myself and not to take things personally it made me realize that you cant control someone elses dreams or lack of dreams
8064048 i thought in those down times ok ive been tested when does the fun begin but i think every experience and every risk you take allows you to grow if i hadnt had those people in my life i wouldnt have my kids and the life ive made with them
8064049 my mom and dad were the foundation for what i am today
8064050 they made me proud to be an achiever they were very positive thinkers no matter what the door was always open for me
8064051 my father was a great teacher he taught me to be clear about goals i was lucky very lucky i had a very safe and secure life so it was a great springboard to go for it all and to handle hard knocks
8064052 oh please whos always up i feel things and i feel them deeply but one of my major things is moving on
8064053 we go to church together we have holidays together theres no oh my god mom and dad are in the same room i never wanted that to happen
8064054 there were times when i was emotionally not as progressive as i am now i viewed divorce as a death it is a death of all the things you planned together its one of the hardest things to go through in life my parents were married for 45 years so i didnt know how to deal with the grief of that kind of separation and the splitting of households but ive been through the pain ive been through hills and valleys at this point in my life i feel settled
8064055 its the adventurer in me something different is next tell me what it is and ill probably say sure
8064056 i wondered what was back there ive been doing fake journalism for five years so i thought fake investigative journalism would be a good career move woodward and bernstein actually found documents its the job of a fake investigative journalist to make up things that he found
8064057 the republicans have so many people they want to kill that itll take ages to get to me michael moore is certainly higher on the list than i am al franken the dixie three they have to kill all three before they get to me
8064058 we envisioned all the graffiti as something a 14 year old boy would do in homeroom there arent many world leaders at the g 8 summit who will sneak up behind the chancellor of germany and give her an impromptu back rub i worked from the behavior i saw so i put him at a mental age of 14
8064059 it always surprises people i cant think of anything stranger i might have created maybe if people found out that id been a leading member of the miami sound machine or c c music factory if theyd known that i was actually terence trent darby that might have surprised them more but it was easier to write dialogue for will smith than to get inside the head of george w bush bush is so much whiter than even i am this was more of a reach
8064060 laughs well according to hugo chavez george bush is satan im breaking george bushs response to the satan accusation on the borowitz report hes pretty sure that chavez just mixed him up with cheney
8064061 actually dont you think the republicans would love this book
8064062 prime minister koizumi searched the keys and found i want you i need you i love you
8064063 like you he was known to sing in public and like you he won admirers in countries far from home that man was elvis
8064064 i would like to pay my sincerest respects to president bush who has been so steadfast and determined in protecting freedom and justice
8064065 hes gentle eyed and so am i off to graceland
8064066 do we really want to have two families rule us for 48 years straight
8064067 this film is going to be enormously helpful to those of us who have been working so hard to get the commissions recommendations implemented
8064068 more people will see this film than probably anything else on the subject telling the whole story of 9 11 will help people better understand the issues involved and what we need to do nationally and locally to prevent another tragedy
8064069 when you take on the responsibility of telling the story behind such an important event it is absolutely critical that you get it right
8064070 having governor kean who chaired the 9 11 commission as a key advisor on this movie has not only been an honor its also been crucial to the project
8064071 los lugare os fueron capaces de confirmar el n mero de v ctimas incluidos sus nombres edades y sexo

8064080 the united states has made a new proposal which is supported by all the other countries including russia and china the iranians have said there are elements of the proposal which are interesting
8064081 the israelis have a major role to play because of all the countries israels future is most affected by iranian nuclear capability
8064082 im not going to tell the israelis how to conduct their foreign policy but for the time being i dont think they can do more than support the latest international initiative while making the necessary arrangements for their self defense at the same time
8064083 i do not agree with the policy of the last five years where you have no direct american contact with iran that doesnt strike me as the appropriate policy
8064084 there is a different government in iran now and the clinton administration had a different policy its a different world now i dont think the clinton administration was wrong to try to deal with iran they did it very carefully opposite a reformist president muhammad khatami and i think that in retrospect many people think that was something that should have been pursued even more aggressively would have it resulted in any progress i have no idea
8064085 thats a decision you cant anticipate because you dont know the iranian response a negotiation has begun make no mistake about it a negotiation has begun between the us and iran indirectly partly in public
8064086 it is a case of prestige for iran to point out that pakistan has nuclear capabilities and they want to get it too as for israel it is a political godsend for the iranians if israel has nuclear weapons then who is the world to tell us that we cant have even peaceful nuclear energy
8064087 the only thing im running for right now is touchdowns
8064088 as someone concerned with energy security issues in the u s and around the world it is extremely important to me to ensure that companies involved in energy management and environmental protection such as energy solutions get the backing they need to be successful
8064089 energy solutions has an impressive proven technology already in production around the globe i believe the technology will play an increasingly important role in the safe and profitable management of americas oil and gas pipelines with energy demand at record levels it is incumbent on the energy industry to be proactive and vigilant on safety and security in addition energy solutions ability to deliver significant operating efficiency and throughput improvements combine to make an attractive service for customers and we are excited about working together
8064090 i never cease to be moved by how much the american experience has meant for free speech and so i want to present to the world the most inspiring the most thought provoking storytellers i want to challenge people
8064091 i look primarily for the ability to tell a story i look for what insight my speakers can offer i look for special expertise that can appeal to a broad audience and i look for long term relationships with my clients as well as customers im the sort of fellow who puts great store in the handshake of honor
8064092 while my classmates were fooling around i was busy inviting local celebrities and officials to speak at miami beach senior high
8064093 the republican national convention was held in miami beach in 1972 and all the radicals were out in force demonstrating abbie hoffman jerry rubin and bobby seale it was fascinating to watch their blend of politics and marketing i became tour guide for some of them
8064094 people saw that i had a passion for organizing lectures and concerts
8064095 all these years i never quite understood what you did for a living
8064096 hard work is important being good to other people is important
8064097 i often tell my 16 year old twins jacob and morgan how important it is to follow ones dream how important it is to be passionate about ones work
8064098 the blessing of a skinned knee using jewish teachings to raise self reliant children
8064099 jewish wisdom holds that our children dont belong to us
8064100 they are both a loan and a gift from god and the gift has strings attached our job is to raise our children to leave us the childrens job is to find their own path in life if they stay carefully protected in the nest of the family children will become weak and fearful or feel too comfortable to want to leave
8064101 my husband is really protective of our girls even more so now that theyre older because its such a critical period for them
8064102 she was as close to a shiksa as he could get
8064103 everyone parents and children seemed off course unmoored and chronically unhappy
8064104 indulged coddled pressured and micromanaged on the outside my young patients appeared to be inadvertently deprived of the opportunity to develop an inside
8064105 they lack the secure reliable welcoming internal structure that we call the self
8064106 now we could see how these people the jews of west los angeles celebrated their ancient holy day
8064107 it was always the same which was what i loved about it
8064108 this is going to sound too pious but i started thinking about my children in terms of a higher mission
8064109 i didnt need to be the mom who cut the ends off lettuce leaves that is idol worship and its exactly what judaism says you shouldnt do
8064110 it wasnt that the jewish texts had a brand new idea that psychology had never come up with
8064111 theyre very different from the id and the ego and the superego psychology textbooks dont typically say that your childs worst trait is also the seed of his best traits
8064112 show you how to raise good people not just good little jews
8064113 without it there would be no marriage no children conceived no homes built no businesses
8064114 as her parent i accept my dual responsibilities one is to respect her zeal her yetser hara and the other is to help her develop a strong yetser tov
8064115 so i will say a calm and emphatic no to the beanie babies and the moon bounce but i will not criticize her for desiring them for that is her right
8064116 there is a longstanding tradition of interpreting talmudic texts not only literally but as symbols for larger constructs or life lessons
8064117 the connection shes making is homiletic its what rabbis do when they give sermons
8064118 the hope is that you will have kavanah or deliberate intent when you do these mitzvahs
8064119 but at the end of the day the rabbis say that if a person does the act then there was some kind of intent and over time we hope the kavanah will follow
8064120 the talmud says the mitzvah of hospitality is as important as torah study and a way to honor god thats because all of this trains us in the habit of thinking about other peoples feelings
8064121 it turned out that was the one night of the week when the whole family could sit down for dinner together
8064122 if you ask parents do you want your children to learn new things they all say of course
8064123 well we cant teach new things without exposing kids to discomfort we are desperate for parents to understand that
8064124 that was my best summer in 16 years of camp
8064125 sometimes i think i wrote the book to remind myself of all the things that i dont want to do that im still doing
8064126 i might have done better at a more progressive school
8064127 i often see parents eager to send their child to the most selective school that will have them and then i see children who mightve flourished wither instead
8064128 thinking about your childs education or worrying about your child period
8064129 i see a lot of kids who dont mature until two or three years into college if they havent taken the courses they need to do what they want to do theyre stuck parents push kids so theyll have opportunities
8064130 if your child has a talent to be a baker dont ask him to be a doctor
8064131 when we ignore a childs intrinsic strengths in an effort to push him toward our notion of extraordinary achievement we are undermining gods plan
8064132 mogels children behaved like good little jewish girls even when they were outside the home because they went to school with other children who came from similar homes
8064133 had her children not learned these things at home their behavior outside the home would have been the same because they would have picked up the culture from their classmates at school
8064134 you get a kind of anguished compliance that can break the bond between parent and adolescent on this one you trust them
8064135 may god make you like sarah rebekah rachel and leah may god bless you and watch over you may god shine his face like a light upon you
8064136 yeah mom plastic and leather like the ones in the school of rock susanna bought them for like 2
8064137 these are people from diverse backgrounds and ages inspired by terrorist ideology operating within their own network
8064138 this is the most vexing problem that law enforcement and domestic intelligence agencies have to face right now
8064139 they can get the material they need to make the bombs easily by going to hardware stores and farm supply stores
8064140 its what we call leaderless terrorism spontaneous terrorism not connected directly to al qaeda but they still are generated by getting their information on the internet from this network of qaeda like qaeda related web sites theyre not doing this for the h of it theyre doing it because they have a perception that the west including canada is anti islamic
8064141 its another example among many that homeland security doesnt understand the nature of the problem
8064142 they were told by a lot of critics they had to give out funds based on the threat they reluctantly agreed and then they came up with a threat termination formula that they applied mechanically and rather stupidly new york they said for example had few significant national landmarks its just a joke of the two cities that have been targeted and attacked by qaeda its always been new york and washington
8064143 we and the canadians have accepted the notion that we cannot put up a fence
8064144 we have to work together to make sure we find the terrorists whether theyre in the united states or canada so we coordinate with canada on who they let into their country and we coordinate with them on ways to find terrorist groups in canada we have to assume the united states and canada are borderless and we coordinate who we let into each country and we share information about suspects in each others country
8064145 they conducted a raid friday based on a tip and didnt find the bomb on site but apparently they found indications that a bomb had been made
8064146 they therefore concluded the bomb may still be at large and it appears to be the type that would throw out a lethal chemical agent
8064147 bin ladens primary target is neither christians nor jews but rather islams traditional clerical institutions
8064148 all through my career ive done what i can to discover new talent and give them a start
8064149 this opportunity with mark burnett dreamworks and fox allows all of us to reach out directly to open a much wider door
8064150 for me like any person who wants to be a filmmaker the opportunity to work hand in hand with steven spielberg is a dream come true
8064151 with the help of our partners at fox peter liguori and reality maestro mike darnell were going to make an incredible show about looking for the next great filmmaker by mining the growing segment of the public making their own content and giving them the chance of a lifetime
8064152 when you have the opportunity to work with people like mark burnett and steven spielberg artists whove redefined this business you jump at the chance
8064153 in this age of digital cameras cell phones with cameras and the internet with hundreds of thousands of people creating their own movies at home every day the concept of this series is completely relevant tapping into a cultural phenomenon as it happens
8064154 everyone enjoys going to the movies reading about the movies and learning about the movies most americans consider themselves amateur film critics and this will give viewers the opportunity to create the next big filmmaker
8064155 now will you please escort him her off the lot

8064159 because now youve got a cory booker in newark a barack obama in illinois the children of the civil rights generation are growing up and theyre taking control its what our parent and grandparents were hoping for
8064160 he will be gone but not forgotten and is going to remain a powerful force as a potential advocate for the city

8064162 come to my fight i need you in my corner take care of my cuts
8064163 i hope we can work together when this is over
8064164 there are prostitutes on my street corner and i call the police and nothing ever gets done
8064165 if i had ever really faced the facts about myself
8064166 i never would have reached for even a zillionth of what ive managed to accomplish
8064167 youre nuts youll never even make it close to the top youre not worthy
8064168 no no no im not listening im going to think about something else
8064169 youre not that talented there must be a lot of other women who really know what theyre doing

8064172 the joys of much too much go for the big life the great career the perfect guy and everything else youve ever wanted

8064184 our eyes met our lips met our bodies met and then we were introduced
8064185 what are you talking about how could i weve known each other since before choate it would be like incest
8064186 please come on i cant stand the thought of having to do it with somebody i hardly know and cant trust
8064187 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god
8064188 there is no such thing as a human nature independent of culture men without culture would not even be the clever savages of lord of the flies
8064189 sebenarnya jalan jalan di sini lebar lebar lihatlah jalan ini berapa delapan jalur searah tapi tetap macet
8064190 setiap kali membuat janji saya harus berangkat minimal satu setengah jam sebelum waktu yang yang disepakati kemacetan di kota ini luar biasa
8064191 books have taken on a special aura even though americans are reading less than ever before
8064192 about a year ago we realized we could do it
8064193 i am proud to be a part of the podcast evolution and pleased so many people care about being involved to the future of country by engaging in this medium
8064194 we asked what cargo was being inspected and the answer was nothing
8064195 if you want to be a millionaire start with a billion dollars and open an airline
8064196 a couple of hours down the highway my cellphone started to ring i wound down the window and threw the cellphone out i wondered who would find it whether they would answer the phone and find themselves gifted with my life
8064197 if were going to have families in this modern age well do it when were good and ready
8064198 small is the new big and the 183 other riffs rants and remarkable business ideas
8064199 enron big got audited by andersen big and failed big the world trade center was a terrorist target network big tv advertising is collapsing so fast you can hear it american airlines big is getting creamed by jetblue small
8064200 small is the new big only when the person running the small thinks big
8064201 youre way more likely to launch more and more randomly which vastly increases your odds
8064202 its hard work to tell your boss that hes being intellectually and emotionally lazy
8064203 the best blogs walk a very fine line between civility and anarchy between passion and privacy
8064204 dont read this book all at once it took me eight years to write and if you read it in one sitting itll give you a headache
8064205 to prove things are going to hell were relying on howie mandel
8064206 i guess i have to thank showtime even though they canceled us
8064207 i hope the people who are criticizing what weve done without even seeing it will be applauding us in the end
8064208 i think we now need to have completely diverse casts
8064209 the pop culture orientation ties in two of the biggest behaviors that drive the web gaming and interest in celebrities
8064210 so aol will reach many more people who will get to sample its services and aol also gets exposed to different advertisers
8064211 there is still no better way of reaching eyeballs than network tv
8064212 on the lot a reality series based on moviemaking produced with steven spielberg it is set to air on the fox network this winter
8064213 shocking expose of life inside the united states air force academy
8064214 im going to beat the s t out of the next guy that calls me a f king jew
8064215 im going to beat the shit out of the next guy that accuses me or our people of killing jesus christ
8064216 i had no notion during those 10 days that i was experiencing history
8064217 soviet tank fires on the unarmed peaceful marchers bearing only hungarian flag are mowed down in budapest
8064218 looking at us without tears without signs of panic without asking unnecessary questions like two little soldiers waiting for instructions
8064219 budapest is no longer merely the name of a city henceforth it is a new and shining symbol of mans yearning to be free
8064220 the great escape nine jews who fled hitler and changed the world
8064221 its never been easy for me but ive always believed in myself
8064222 i think ive always had the right kind of motivations and ideals i think my mother was a great influence with how she raised us just by her struggles being a single mother with two kids working numerous jobs and forcing us to have our independence early because of that
8064223 we learned the value of hard work and its stuck with me in everything ive done whether it was in high school being valedictorian or going to college and excelling in business school and least of which in some of my estimation is sports
8064224 its never been easy for me ive always been small always told that i couldnt achieve things but ive always believed in myself and as my mom always said you believe in yourself because if you dont know one else will and i think thats pushed me
8064225 ive failed a lot you know that i easily could have folded and said what everyone else is saying about me youre right but ive accepted all of that and been determined to correct it in any way that i could and its made me a durable player mostly mentally when i go through hardships and i go through down points i know because of what ive been through that i can pull through it and be successful anyway
8064226 and its funny you say that because my mother calls me every week before the game calls my brother ronde as well and she never calls us when she knows she can get us she calls us when she knows that shes gonna get the answering machine
8064227 its true i know that everything that i do is making someone else proud is making someone whose shoulders ive been standing on my entire life proud its a big responsibility but i take it seriously cause i know if i give less than a full effort then im doing not only myself a disservice but all those people who have been supporting me my entire life
8064228 i play like a big back and i get treated like that dbs cut me all the time they dont try to tackle me up top even though i only weigh maybe five or 10 pounds more than them
8064229 the balance is not letting that ego distract from the goal at hand which is a team winning
8064230 winning the super bowl because ive done everything else i think except for winning the rushing title but thats an individual accomplishment that doesnt focus on the team concept that we preach here
8064231 que para m es un sue o volver a la calle

8064235 success is still possible but we must take measures now
8064236 hezbollah is like a cancer on the body politic of lebanon but theyre so strong and so powerful lebanon itself cant get rid of them
8064237 blobs who dont say anything arent allowed to say anything they are paid to shut up
8064238 i think what people will be really surprised about is the writing
8064239 its not just another celebrity book hes not so much interested in spilling the beans about a particular celebrity but about showing what celebrity does to those people
8064240 i also loved the prewar frenzy of evelyn waugh that feeling of the end of the world coming
8064241 entertainment is becoming the great decoy we are so entertained its almost impossible for us to think about anything else the only thing that has continuity in the news is jennifer lopezs bottom
8064242 i always thought an actor should be like a bodybuilder his life should be like a muscle it should be exercised and flexed and worked
8064243 their eyes were shocked and dead and alive and glowing like coals at the same time and i think that was through experience using your life as a tool thats the way i wanted to conduct myself
8064244 ive seen it all from the toxic bachelor to the happily betrothed from the modelizers to mr big women today are charting new territory balancing busy careers with their families and trying to find time for the all the relationships in their lives i cant wait to connect with them on the air after writing extensively about these topics i am thrilled to make the leap from the page to the radio my show fits right in with the smart definitive programming sirius has for women
8064245 we launched our one year master of science in criminology program in 2004 for individuals who are interested in careers in criminal justice policy and practice and who are passionate about making change happen in how the justice system does business
8064246 this generous gift from laurie and sheldon will help provide vital support to our most outstanding students
8064247 naming this fund after the pre eminent criminal justice change agent was only natural
8064248 we are honored to have janet reno here with us at its launching
8064249 im scared to have a family the divorce rates are so high
8064250 dont you know that 100 years ago a kid had the same chance of having divorced parents
8064251 so although weve been promoting that were going to do it now were actually doing it and are in production
8064252 im sure it wont take any less than a couple of years
8064253 in values driven business ben cohen and mal warwick use simple language and abundant examples to show how any company no matter how small can do well by doing good
8064254 invaluable reading for those starting or running a small to mid sized business and for entrepreneurial students in business schools a practical easy to read guide to running a socially responsible business from some of the most innovative and successful pioneers in the field
8064255 very best that can be said is that we are losing at a slightly lower rate
8064256 championing a conservative traditionalist public health approach which is simply looking to identify the infected and contain them
8064257 the future of united states energy policy is dependent on deploying innovative technologies on coal our countrys greatest energy resource in a clean and responsible manner
8064258 rentechs proprietary coal to liquids technology gives us the opportunity to utilize coal to produce ultra clean fuels for the nation while protecting the environment and creating jobs
8064259 the application of fischer tropsch ft coal to liquids technologies like rentechs could be an essential tool in president bushs new advanced energy initiative to reduce americas dependence on imported oil
8064260 good news is hard to find in the new u n report
8064261 fewer than one in five people at risk of hiv infection has any access to hiv prevention information
8064262 building and strengthening health care systems in the developing world
8064263 the problem was with bill clinton the scandals and the rumored scandals the incubating ones and the dying ones never ended whatever moral compass the president was consulting was leading him in the wrong direction his closets were full of skeletons just waiting to burst out
8064264 when i sent the pass back with a note i had no idea it would antagonize the president
8064265 i dont know how they referred to me and i really didnt care
8064266 my role and my obligation was to conduct criminal investigations he unfortunately for the country and unfortunately for him happened to be the subject of that investigation
8064267 bill clinton raised the subject only to tell the crown prince that he understood the saudis reluctance to cooperate and then he hit abdullah up for a contribution to the clinton presidential library
8064268 well it was like a bad movie and it was ridiculous that ken starr and myself the director of the fbi find ourselves in that ridiculous position
8064269 holbrooke and clark played such key roles in negotiating the dayton peace accords and ashdown is continuing the implementation and preparing the way for the international community to scale back its presence and involvement
8064270 ashdown is the most powerful person in bosnia and herzegovina today
8064271 the women in this book have realized that you cant completely rely on men
8064272 success and self actualization was what really made women glow they shone with the fullness of life
8064273 when we get together were not really talking about sex and relationships
8064274 what i tried to do with the characters is put them in the same situation that powerful and successful men often find themselves
8064275 im fascinated by what its like to be a woman in one of those powerful positions because there is really no road map about how youre supposed to behave just as society needs to re evaluate our ideas about femininity and what women can do we as women need to re evaluate our ideas about it too
8064276 shes not quite up to the job of preaching female empowerment without sounding as if shes uncorked some vintage whine
8064277 its really about the struggle for self actualization the struggle to believe in yourself against the odds of what society tells women
8064278 how do we live life on our own terms its an issue for all of us
8064279 i was struggling for money struggling to be taken seriously
8064280 quintessential confused 20 something trying to keep my head above water
8064281 but i was still hedging my bets maybe mr right will come along and save me i couldnt let go of that idea
8064282 i remember when i got the first copies of sex and the city
8064283 finally i had achieved my lifelong dream and all i could think is im by myself theres no one to share this with
8064284 i think that we both feel like were really equal and were really partners
8064285 if its right for you to have kids you will have kids
8064286 there are a lot of different ways to have kids at the same time i dont think its right to say to a woman that you have to have kids to feel fulfilled
8064287 so much can and will happen to you in your 40s
8064288 all of it may not be good some of it is probably going to be bad but some of it may also be really great
8064289 i decided i would be bigger stronger and faster than anyone so they wouldnt know i was gay
8064290 if my team mates knew i was gay id have been taken out hurt maybe killed
8064291 i thought what if someone id been with sees me on tv or in the newspaper and calls up and says congratulations green bay you just drafted a gay guy
8064292 it hurt to see players smiling with their families one night and cheating on their wives the next they treated so lightly what i wanted so badly pain pills and alcohol became my closest friends
8064293 this young woman was pregnant with them and already had several children she was struggling to feed
8064294 id seen the look on the faces of my sisters and brothers when they brought home their first borns i wanted that too
8064295 that the door had been opened but i couldnt i shook him dude wake up get off me
8064296 we didnt have sex for ages we just talked and talked
8064297 i didnt know my real dad i came out early and my stepfather was very homophobic i didnt relate to a mans world esera was a man who could love me as a man but my imagination stopped at the idea of maybe one day finding a long term partner i never dreamed of the whole kids family in the suburbs thing i never thought something so rich and full would be available to me but esera he didnt know any better that was what was so fresh about him he was like why not he had that whole extended family environment that was his template and because he never was part of a gay culture he couldnt see any limitations
8064298 we had this perfect beautiful life behind closed doors then as they got older we realised we had to come out for them we couldnt go on pretending we both would want to go to the parent teacher evenings we owed it to them and our family and friends to stop telling lies esera made the decision to quit football
8064299 while the rest of us were living out our dreams of playing in the nfl esera was fighting this internal battle every day of his life in solitude
8064300 i saw him on the oprah show and got in touch
8064301 you feel so alone in the world i lie to all my friends and hate it it was such a relief to be able to talk to esera he is a kind of lifeline and a mentor
8064302 you get into sport before you really know about sex or love then by the time you know youre definitely gay youre part of the system admired well paid and scared stiff
8064303 i suffered a shock in my senior year when i returned from summer vacation i walked into the locker room and spotted the promotional poster with the teams schedule that would hang all over town and elsewhere it said killer beavers but instead of the usual team photo there was a picture of just me with my name my breath came up short i felt an instant ache in my gut other players would have been happy to see their faces on a poster but being a gay man i felt paranoia that poster would go back to hawaii what if one of the one night stands from hulas recognised the man he met and realised his name wasnt kavika i spent a couple of weeks looking over my shoulder i was nervous every time i walked into the coaches room i feared my coach summoning me in a menacing tone esera i need to talk to you
8064304 life got harder for me each year in the nfl
8064305 i would challenge anyone who is saying that to look at the analysis of the supreme court in the hamdi decision regarding their interpretation of the authorization to use military force
8064306 had this program been in effect prior to 9 11 it is my professional judgment that we would have detected some of the 9 11 al qaeda operatives in the united states and we would have identified them as such
8064307 you know we think its important we need to change the law
8064308 look these are people like you and me who work at the nsa theyre good americans they hold very dear the constitution particularly the fourth amendment which is applicable in all of this you got to trust us
8064309 the book intends to raise these issues but im not giving odds that these things will happen
8064310 as a matter of policy for example our country advocates democracy in the middle east that could lead to the overthrow of the royal house in saudi arabia if that country did become a republic its not clear that the good guys would be in charge so while im not predicting the fall of the house of saud i am raising questions that would emerge if that were to happen
8064311 help please help me please oh god please over here help
8064312 therell be time for that later sir but right now we have to get you the hell out of here
8064313 aye and there are experts coming to help them sir and besides youre in no shape to be helpin anyone
8064314 hear all of that shootin out front this is not yet over
8064315 the station has had this route on the list for four years since that foreign ministers conference here
8064316 theyd give their lives if they had to to protect the kutty
8064317 i got on to admiral adams over at the navy base
8064318 theres dead brits and americans maybe a dozen each three times that many in local staff and guest workers we think it was a truck bomb probably an rdx mix over ammonium perchlorate
8064319 a drive by shooting followed just as the rescue workers showed up word is that the drive by shooter was in a red crescent wagon an american under secretary for something or other was on an upper floor of course the lucky bastard was unharmed he wasnt in the lobby caf because he had them open up the al fanar club on the roof for a private little breakfast with somebody
8064320 okay nance but we know first reports are usually wrong any claims of responsibility
8064321 not yet no need really theres no question its bahraini hezbollah otherwise known as your friendly iranian rev guards and their lovely qods force boys
8064322 ah good what could we do without the me division chief
8064323 douglas you look an awful mess my deepest sympathies about ian martin i will ring up his wife as soon as we are done here we will of course take care of her
8064324 do we understand brian that this is the beginning of an overt destabilization effort directed against bahrain by the new rulers in riyadh
8064325 unless they had it out for someone specific perhaps that visiting american dig no i would advise whitehall that this is the start of something but not in our view inspired by riyadh more likely iranian inspired and intended to get the little king here to kick out the americans from their navy base
8064326 not bloody likely pam theyre a savvy group here they may be close to the americans but they can and do think for themselves
8064327 i think what we have here is the opening of a new terror wave in bahrain controlled by tehran and remember
8064328 the shia are in the majority here even though the kings government is largely sunni iran has seen that as a potential weakness here for years failed every time they tried to exploit it but havent given up
8064329 with all deference to our heroic and i see bloodied station chief i think in the thick of it as it were director that he overlooks the obvious this is not an iranian attack it comes across the causeway from saudi the riyadh crowd wants to make sure king hamad doesnt let the yanks use this little island as a base for operations against their fledgling little caliphate
8064330 we will give all assistance to the king here but we shall not be alone in that the americans wont abandon this place the little gulf states are all that they have left after the fall of the house of saud and the creation of islamyah coming right after their pullout from iraq the yanks are like sandwich meat spread thin onto the gulfies between two very big hunks of hostile bread iran and islamyah
8064331 kicked out of iran in 79 politely pushed out of saudi in 03 invited to leave iraq by their frankenstein in 06 then the fall of the al sauds last year now they are just hanging on in the region with only the little guys to help them kuwait bahrain qatar the emirates oman and how long can they hang on there sic transit gloria imperi just ask us
8064332 the attack on the diplomat was not a one off director the noise that you just heard was the sound of the crowne plaza down the street from the diplomat pancaking
8064333 america has been going through a rough patch but were going to get through it
8064334 i was thinking of course about my father i was thinking about how beautiful the countryside was and i began to think about prayer
8064335 one nation under god the history of prayer in america
8064336 there was nothing in my career that would have led anyone to believe i would write this book
8064337 it wasnt very much until the end of his life when he realized he was dying of cancer
8064338 then he filled his hospital room with statues and crosses and crucifixes and rosaries anything that spoke to what he believed would be the hereafter and would somehow help him pray and bring him closer to god
8064339 thats based on the premise that america and its people have been going through a rough patch and that were going to get through it because americans have always possessed attributes like decency hard work and spirituality
8064340 the results point to new patterns of spending american consumers are educated savvy and careful with their money they know how to find good deals and have shifted spending to accommodate the latest round of oil shocks
8064341 americans have become more like purchasing agents professional procurers who know how to develop spending strategies to adapt to the times maintain living standards and save money
8064342 you dont need an engineering degree or math degree its really for regular people
8064343 it will be a fun interactive game and it will be in my style with a big opening
8064344 this is a totally original concept that comes to us from the guy who created reality television
8064345 it defines engagement its disruptive by nature and it certainly will be habit forming all the best of the internet in one fell swoop
8064346 the wonderful thing about the internet is everything is archived
8064347 if over the last three weeks six solid gold caches have been found you can go back and look at the solutions and the clues and see how the clue providers are thinking
8064348 there are many paths to many clues but only a very small group will know the grand total sum of those clues
8064349 in the next few months well kick the program off
8064350 its a very big initiative for america online and myself
8064351 we are aiming at online gamers and reality tv fans
8064352 there are going to be very arcane hard to find clues and theyll be buried well within the aol content
8064353 you know i didnt get into this show until after it went off the air
8064354 i think because when it was on i wasnt a new yorker so i didnt get a lot of it know what i mean
8064355 i said if i never go there again it will be too soon
8064356 obviously i want to win a super bowl this year
8064357 ideally id want to get 10 000 yards and win a super bowl next year then im done and ill go do something else
8064358 one of the things that mark said to me was all you have to do is perform on the field and ill make everything else fall into place
8064359 thats the mentality that ive had the last seven years as long as i keep playing well i can keep not just knocking on doors i can keep kicking in doors to do what i want to do
8064360 has there ever been a guy in the latter stages of his n f l career who has been in a more enviable position than tiki
8064361 im setting myself up to do whatever i feel like doing
8064362 the only requirements he told me when i first started were comfort and flat screens everywhere
8064363 i feel like i represent what the giants are supposed to be
8064364 you want your best players to be good people as owners you couldnt ask for anything more
8064365 its a group of guys who really cared for the fact that they played for the giants that really appreciated that they played in new york
8064366 right now this is tikis world and he handles it so well
8064367 i like having the power of influence and using it in the right way
8064368 you just meet people either they become great friends or they become great contacts if i were in green bay if i had been drafted by the packers my life would not be what it is right now im very aware of that and i appreciate what new york has brought to me
8064369 fifteen million children have lost one or both parents to aids
8064370 business must play a role in the fight against aids
8064371 it does seem that it needs to be treated like a war
8064372 its truly a testament to what a small business can do in this global fight
8064373 confronting hiv aids is the responsibility of every nation and a moral imperative for the united states
8064374 but governments alone cannot win the fight against hiv aids
8064375 i believe in the private sector having a role in the planet
8064376 they should be directing their energy into saving lives instead of contributing to the failure of the global aids response the global response is completely failing
8064377 hiv aids is not only a human tragedy of enormous magnitude it is also a threat to the stability of entire countries and to entire regions of the world
8064378 what were going to have to do is take on aids
8064379 ultimately all the federal government does is not going to be able to get the job done without your aid
8064380 youve got to rent it up youve got to make it more rent
8064381 i was not expecting that at all i thought this girl is all prim and proper on the outside but shes a wild woman on the inside
8064382 how do i wear flats without making my legs look stubby
8064383 synergistically i hate that word its so 90s but each of these projects feeds one another
8064384 i dont know how the clothes can exist without the show and i dont know how the show can exist without the clothes
8064385 were putting it on his shoulders because he can take the weight hes magic with people people either want to hug him or laugh with him
8064386 one of the things that im very hellbent on doing is not pre interviewing the hell out of subjects
8064387 on a lot of shows you can feel that the guest is being set up to tell the cute story
8064388 it meant that i would have to sit up and get closer because i cant hear cancers
8064389 they tend to speak very lowly and usually they need a little coaxing
8064390 my biggest goal and biggest ambition in life was to be a great conversationalist
8064391 i care about clothes and design but more than anything i care about being this unscripted personality
8064392 tomorrows new york times will say that dick cheney told scooter libby the name of my wife
8064393 notes of the previously undisclosed conversation between the vice presidents chief of staff i lewis libby jr and cheney on june 12 2003 appear to differ from mr libbys testimony to a federal grand jury that he initially learned about the cia officer valerie wilson from journalists the lawyers said
8064394 we had no idea how fortunate our timing would be at his arrival
8064395 i was very glad we chose him as a speaker
8064396 this administration betrayed the vote of confidence the american people gave it after september 11
8064397 from march to early july 2004 i did everything i could to get the government to set the record straight
8064398 when they would not set the record straight i did this white house operates with a take no prisoners approach so they decided they would take me down they have never ceased to impugn me and attack my wifes credibility
8064399 what i did was not a great act of courage but an act of civic duty this issue is not about us but our country
8064400 what will we tolerate from our elected officials this case is about a citizens right to redress a grievance national security issues are not republican or democratic issues they are american issues atomic bombs in palo alto or menlo park are not only going to affect democrats or republicans but americans
8064401 he is an american hero and i support him and his struggle with this administration its all about getting this administration to tell the truth
8064402 the cia would not have arbitrarily referred this case to the department of justice had there not been a belief that laws had been violated
8064403 i dont believe there should be any place at the senior reaches of our government for people of scrupulous character
8064404 this administration is genetically incapable of handling iraq right until you get rid of some of the people around the president
8064405 it is little more than a peace agreement between the shiites and the kurds at the expense of the sunnis it will institutionalize violence for the foreseeable future
8064406 its not a bush bashing book its a book about one mans time in the foreign service
8064407 i think the bush administration is trying to cover up their wrongdoings by attacking his wife
8064408 i dont know as much as i would like to but i bought his book
8064409 i thought he had a really interesting perspective on everything that has happened
8064410 the bottom line is that it is not etched in stone that 71 percent was for five specific states and pennsylvania wasnt one of them what we do know is that prices are going to increase as we head for the fall
8064411 well well make our adjustments for the final fall period oct 1 but there are a lot of things people can look to this winter heating system
8064412 it would probably be a good thing if we could relocate some we have a disproportionate number located in this region that are susceptible to the hurricanes obviously so it would be better if we had more refineries
8064413 one of the big misconceptions about me is that i walk around in miniskirts and high heels twenty four seven and go to the gym in heels
8064414 shes that side of me that was afraid of rejection that was afraid to take a chance and step up and have someone say no you dont get the role
8064415 i do still have that side of me that soft sensitive side and i think that carmen is the more aggressive part of me there are moments when i am so that little girl from cincinnati ohio where she grew up and i cry and im just like everybody else you know i have all the same feelings that everyone else has
8064416 i think he gave us some more to think about and more to think about in this whole area of diplomacy
8064417 he gave us good recommendations that we can form a consensus around
8064418 what he did was refocus me and all of us in coming up with a plan for diplomacy
8064419 we decided we would get together and talk about and formulate a plan based on what he told us to lead this country and pressure this administration on the diplomatic issues that it hasnt been involved in
8064420 become the go to guy for congressional democrats on national security and the war in iraq
8064421 in that role he walks it like he talks it
8064422 hes talking to all sides in trying to unify democrats on at least developing a plan as an alternative to the befuddlement that is the administrations policy
8064423 no question in anybodys mind that we have to discuss what is going to happen in iraq we have to put together a plan
8064424 diplomacy is the no 1 tool that our administration doesnt know how to use at all
8064425 his background and his experience he has a clear vision of how we got into this and how to get out
8064426 members of the out of iraq caucus have a variety of opinions and views thats why the organization was brought together
8064427 i have tried to organize people around the idea that the war has to stop without taking sides and getting into timelines
8064428 some want it by december others by next year i think we are very smart in not setting a timeline doing that if we forge a strategic plan around diplomacy we havent created any enemies and we can form a consensus
8064429 well respected and knows so much about the military and how it operates and what is going on
8064430 he shared with us that he just never agreed with the war in iraq and thinks we need to provide more leadership to get us out of iraq but we cant just do it right now we cant just walk away
8064431 he thinks its very important to understand that the terrorists would like nothing better than to have us exit right now and then the terrorists would move faster to take over and create this civil war
8064432 every day i ride the mantrip down the main line get out and walk back into the gob and feel the air pressure on my face i know the mine like i know a man can sense things about it that arent right even when everything on paper says it is every day heres something that needs to be done because men will be hurt if it isnt done or the coal the companys promised to load wont get loaded coal is the life blood of this country if we fail the country fails
8064433 theres no men in the world like miners sonny theyre good men strong men the best there is i think no matter what you do with your life no matter where you go or who you know you will never know such good and strong men
8064434 right now the book business has been affected by the slowing of the economy like other things have as well
8064435 weve been really really pleased with the customers response to the site
8064436 for this landmark television project we decided to seek out the best and the brightest from the independent filmmaking community to bring a fresh approach to chronicling these fascinating turning points in american history
8064437 we are thrilled by the creativity energy and meticulous research these award winning documentarians brought to each event
8064438 we challenged the filmmakers to go beyond the predictable and to think about different and interesting ways to illuminate familiar and lesser known events that would be intriguing to our audience
8064439 susan came up with the concept for the special and has worked tirelessly over many months to shape and refine it by engaging an exceptional team of independent filmmakers she enabled each of them to put their unique imprimatur on their particular show while collectively telling compelling stories about the origins of our country as part of 10 days that unexpectedly changed america
8064440 some days may be obvious while others may be surprising some unfolded during a single day while others triggered a cultural upheaval that lasted years
8064441 in true the history channel fashion the goal of this major project was to select historical moments representing the broad themes that shaped americas people culture and history while creating compelling informative and entertaining television we hope that the choice of days will spark debate and conversation and raise awareness of the colorful and fascinating history of our great nation
8064442 in an effort to avoid obvious and often told events such as the signing of the declaration of independence and the bombing of pearl harbor we asked our advisors to think broadly and creatively about american history and culture to include events that reflect the diversity of current historical research and to weigh each events impact on our world today
8064443 in the end we have 10 great filmmakers and 10 very intriguing days
8064444 ive been an admirer of joes work for many years and we had been looking for a project to do together
8064445 he is extremely well respected within the independent film community as well as with cable networks i thought he was the ideal person to help shepherd this ambitious project
8064446 i hope we realize that the people of new orleans werent just abandoned during the hurricane
8064447 they were abandoned long ago to murder and mayhem in the streets to substandard schools to dilapidated housing to inadequate health care to a pervasive sense of hopelessness
8064448 americans tend to think of poor people as being responsible for their own economic woes
8064449 but this was a case where the poor were clearly not at fault it was a reminder that we have a moral obligation to provide every american with a decent life
8064450 their cause must be our cause too and we shall overcome
8064451 so many of the people in the arenas here you know were underprivileged anyway
8064452 i worked hard all my life and i cant afford nothing
8064453 im not saying that i want to keep up with the joneses i just want to live better
8064454 a n ger is a n ger is a n ger
8064455 has the capacity to load up their family in an suv fill it up with 100 worth of gasoline stick some bottled water in the trunk and use a credit card to check into a hotel on safe ground
8064456 i have lived in the city all my life and i didnt realize there were so many people suffering socioeconomically if you believe in the idea of community then we all bear responsibility
8064457 we all need to do what we can to turn things around

8064460 decentralizing power in iraq offers the best chance for iraqis to live in peaceful united country where they can resolve their differences the american people want to win in iraq and this represents a viable way forward to stability and success
8064461 joe and i might be running for the nomination of two different parties but we agree on one thing the american people want progress in iraq and this represents a viable way forward to stability and success
8064462 decentralizing power in iraq offers the best chance for iraqis to live in a peaceful united country where they can resolve their differences it is time to begin the political surge we desperately need to help stabilize iraq so we can get our troops out of harms way
8064463 partisan politics must not come in the way of finding a solution to the war in iraq
8064464 the overwhelming majority of americans want us to get our troops out of iraq as quickly as possible without leaving chaos behind i look forward to joining senator brownback next week in iowa to explain how the biden brownback boxer amendment makes iraq the worlds problem while establishing a political solution that gives iraqs warring factions breathing room to resolve their differences
8064465 quite a bit of kings planned speech does talk about civil rights but there is a connection to morals and thats the part
8064466 defending the life of innocents is the most basic civil right and i am proud to support dr alveda king and her efforts on the pro life issue civil rights and helping people in need
8064467 joe and i might be running for the nomination of two different parties but we agree on one thing the american people want progress in iraq and this represents a viable way forward to stability and success

8064471 a pair of air jordans cant make you play like michael jordan
8064472 the clover cant add any flavors that arent there already so the giant would have a long way to go before their coffee is on par with ours
8064473 to be getting the best coffees in the world they would have one coffee at five stores another coffee at five stores how would they keep track of it and train baristas in those stores how to talk about those coffees i think it would be an operational nightmare
8064474 i wanted to hear what he had to say what their grand plan is
8064475 if he wanted to know third wave secrets that would be pretty hefty consulting fees
8064476 the bottom of the housing downturn is coming into view
8064477 we need to see more of the same kind of reports over the next few months showing increasing affordability and a reduction in inventory
8064478 its therapeutic that these foreclosed properties are being sold off at deep discounts
8064479 theres no question people are getting values today better than they could have dreamed of getting two years ago
8064480 we felt that was the way the market was going
8064481 were starting to see some of things we need to form a bottom in the next six to 12 months
8064482 read at night keep informed about the world through radio and television and refrigerate life saving vaccines
8064483 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8064484 he is one of the truly remarkable writing and performing talents of today

8064486 today i went to visit my book it has found its way into the most prestigious place in town the university of washington medical school bookstore i have to chuckle they must not know yet what is in the book
8064487 i have seen a lot of self published books in my time and this is the best one i have ever seen
8064488 ach you know its just another day in the township
8064489 niet alleen leerden de vrijwilligers in korte tijd wat verpleegkundigen in jaren leren ze moesten hun studie ook combineren met hun rol als moeder vrouw en zuster
8064490 in onze community leunen mensen liever achterover om te kijken wat er mislukt dus toen jullie begonnen met de organisatie vonden jullie veel weestand er was geen geld en een plaats om te werken
8064491 de homecarers zijn nu afgestudeerd maar onze pati nten die in krotten wonen zonder familie en geld voor eten hebben het nog steeds erg zwaar

8064493 we democrats have been working every day for hard working americans we raised the minimum wage

8064495 actually my current car is the only one ive ever owned i only passed my test two years ago
8064496 for me its relaxing to just go out in my car and drive for an hour or so
8064497 at home in switzerland there is beautiful countryside and its the same in belgrade when i visit my family i sometimes drive near the rivers
8064498 im not going to vote for mccain but i might not vote for obama either
8064499 i was such a proud supporter of hillary and chair of her campaign but right now im so fired up to elect barack obama
8064500 its more disappointment than anything and theyll get over it
8064501 i dont think any of them is crazy enough to think theyre better off with mccain
8064502 if obama had lost and by such a small margin no one would call his supporters whiners its so pejorative
8064503 i hope it doesnt do any damage because we certainly dont need that
8064504 its a historic part of my life that a woman got so far
8064505 help me help me feel more part of church again
8064506 both an objective change of some kind in the eucharistic elements to become the body and blood of christ and the subjective faith of the believer who receives the sacrament
8064507 time to put the stickers down we need to take communion
8064508 holy holy holy lord god of power and might heaven and earth are full of your glory hosanna in the highest
8064509 blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest
8064510 on the night he was handed over to suffering and death our lord jesus christ took bread and when he had given thanks to you he broke it and gave it to his disciples and said take eat this is my body which is given for you
8064511 after supper he took the cup of wine and when he had given thanks he gave it to them and said drink this all of you this is my blood of the new covenant which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins
8064512 christ our passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feast the gifts of god for the people of god take them in remembrance that christ died for you and feed on him in your hearts by faith with thanksgiving
8064513 i guess i made a mistake in cutting a joke
8064514 love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind

8064524 the company knowingly stole from its customers mostly poor people and the recently deceased when it designed and implemented the sweeps
8064525 the attorney generals characterization of our conduct and the parties voluntary settlement is not accurate
8064526 we of course are committed to treating our customers fairly and we voluntarily ended the computer process at issue on our own in 2003
8064527 no you dont need a town you need a village green a house and a justice hall
8064528 you dont need to know where every broom is standing and every book is laying just figure out where the chairs and fireplace are
8064529 i got to go pee boy is the bathroom busy
8064530 well you know this kind of makes me look like a doofus so you know the whole ban on me running for office is pretty much out the window now you know

8064533 at the end of the day running around saying my guy is the messiah over and an echo chamber
8064534 and what the rebbe was creating was the opposite of an echo chamber
8064535 the rebbe says you have to be crazy about moshiach
8064536 did i tell you about the time i got arrested
8064537 it violates common sense and makes the movement seem insane
8064538 they think it turns people off to hasidic teaching and its a sincere concern
8064539 when people tell me that the kind of scene i just described is crazy
8064540 i react by saying that there are millions of people in the world who are perfectly normal and intelligent people who believe that the priest is holding a piece of bread and that this bread is the real presence of jesus of nazareth
8064541 judaism says that in every generation there is a righteous person that connects the world to the divine energy
8064542 if there is no leader the world would actually cease to exist so the fact that the rebbe has died and that the world continues to exist is a conundrum to them and it leads them to believe that the rebbe must not have died but even people who believe he did die find this to be a challenging question
8064543 with your luck yechi ha melech youll find the meat
8064544 the swift boat episode is a bitter pill that i dont think many democrats will forget
8064545 but we will move on the issue of energy independence is bigger
8064546 the guys got ideas about renewable energy and energy independence
8064547 i dont care whose ideas they are this country needs it
8064548 people dont like change until they see how it works
8064549 even in the best wind areas it only works 40 percent of the time
8064550 it probably could work i just dont see it working in nevada i would prefer to support the development of battery storage
8064551 hes had a rocky relationship with the partys conservative base
8064552 the republican party is the next guy in line party whoever he picks as vice president could become the next guy in line if he picks a mainstream conservative then the conservatives can get excited not just about the mccain candidacy but the future of the party
8064553 a week ago romney and pawlenty looked like the two most likely conservative choices but i think over the last several days events have conspired against both of them
8064554 ive got nothing for you on the vp question he will select a fine running mate i dont know who that will be
8064555 i think his aides floated the idea of lieberman to prove to mccain that it would get knocked down
8064556 hey girlll wanna ride i guarantee that you will like i mean come on i have the batmobile

8064578 behold when you have entered the city a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water follow him into the house which he enters
8064579 where is the guest room where i may eat the passover with my disciples
8064580 with fervent desire i have desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer for i say to you i will no longer eat of it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of god
8064581 take this and divide it among yourselves for i say to you i will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of god comes
8064582 this is my body which is given for you do this in remembrance of me
8064583 this cup is the new covenant in my blood which is shed for you but behold the hand of my betrayer is with me on the table and truly the son of man goes as it has been determined but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed

8064586 he saved others let him save himself if he is the christ the chosen of god
8064587 if you are the king of the jews save yourself
8064588 do you not even fear god seeing you are under the same condemnation and we indeed justly for we receive the due reward of our deeds but this man has done nothing wrong
8064589 assuredly i say to you today you will be with me in paradise

8064600 if you look past the speeches to his record one thing is clear
8064601 john mccain has never believed in renewable energy and he wont make it part of americas future
8064602 this is a significant step for me to get back out on the practice field
8064603 if things go well as we expect they will then i hope to be full go next week and ready for the season opener
8064604 were going to monitor him and rookie tight end tom santi who will start practicing today
8064605 so we do have a pitch count on those guys
8064606 i think its somewhat irrelevant because of where we are today and i kind of like to keep you guys guessing
8064607 i never really like talking too much about an injury because if you play well they say man look how tough he is
8064608 i hope to be ready and i certainly dont want to create this dramatic announcement i think i will do some parts of practice today and tomorrow and i may even dress for thursdays game though i wont play well do a short practice monday and then hopefully ill be full go wednesday
8064609 hes been doing it forever hes been doing it since he was 6 years old in his backyard
8064610 he and marvin harrison have been together forever and this is my eighth year so you kind of get used to it
8064611 we really dont know at this point where it is
8064612 it could be anywhere from a couple of weeks to a major injury we dont know that yet jeff has some options but we dont know how bad it is and it could be through this weekend before we know for sure
8064613 ive always been confident hell be ready for the opener
8064614 well start to see how that goes one thing is we dont want to put him out there if hes not physically or mentally ready
8064615 i guess its sort of like the wild card years ago where there were people criticizing it and now they want more wild cards
8064616 just because you do something and it works well you dont go on to do more you leave it at this
8064617 there was no reason to wait there was no reason not to implement it i wanted to do it as soon as possible
8064618 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8064619 it seems unprecedented to me unless you count the nba changing balls in mid season in january 2007
8064620 weve got the technology and the ability to get calls right so we should
8064621 there was a bit of a storm brewing that could have resulted in egg on mlbs face
8064622 to the extent a call would be missed in the playoffs people might have asked why didnt mlb move faster to deal with this issue
8064623 its just fabulous to see them climbing around see them exploring its incredible
8064624 jamie one of the chimps spent years in the lab and would pluck the hair on her belly just out of sheer boredom
8064625 as far as we know their feet have never touched the earth its always been concrete or bars
8064626 i was a little speechless i thought theyd take time more
8064627 but the care and trust and bonding thats formed at this place they know this is a special safe place for them
8064628 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8064629 we have the man we need at last to embrace the future not the past and to dispel eight years of pain and shame barack obama is his name call the roll
8064630 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8064631 real sex education voted against affordable family planning and if elected john mccain has vowed to appoint supreme court justices who will overturn roe v wade
8064632 while families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day john mccain is sleeping better than ever
8064633 placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8064634 john mccain offers four more years of the same bush cheney policies that have failed us
8064635 this is our time to revive the spirit of kennedy
8064636 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
8064637 my inclination is you have to be careful about attacking mccain
8064638 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8064639 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8064640 to make true as a piece of mechanism or the like to place adjust or shape accurately to give the precise required form or position to to make accurately or perfectly straight level round smooth sharp etc as required often with up
8064641 if black english isnt a language then tell me what is
8064642 language is also a political instrument means and proof of power
8064643 i do not know what white americans would sound like if there had never been any black people in the united states but they would not sound the way they sound
8064644 the most important aspect of eating well is having access to fresh local naturally raised ingredients but it takes the development of sustainable local systems to do that theres no such thing as one sustainable business you need to be a part of a sustainable system
8064645 its not enough to have a business with good values we must work cooperatively with other businesses to build whole local economies based on the values of social and environmental sustainability as well as financial sustainability
8064646 over the last seven years in particular ive focused my resources on helping to build a local food system for our region as well as building a whole local economy comprised of locally owned businesses that strive toward a triple bottom line not just profit but people and planet too
8064647 aliza green was our chef back in the 80s and she brought the style of cooking to the white dog that we became known for buying top ingredients from local farmers and cooking in a way that highlights those natural flavors
8064648 the white dog is also very committed to fair trade relationships for ingredients that cant be grown locally like coffee and chocolate
8064649 since 2001 ive focused my attention on increasing the social impact of the white dog by starting various nonprofit organizations
8064650 that work began with my concern about the inhumane and environmentally and socially damaging effects of the factory farming of pigs
8064651 after that i found out about the importance of eating only grass fed beef and found local sources for beef eventually all of the animal products on our menu came from local humane family farms and our produce from local organic farms in season
8064652 but i realized that this wasnt good enough we needed to build a whole local system so i started fair food to build that system by getting more businesses to buy from local farms basically we shared our proprietary information with our competitors in order to strengthen the local economy i think thats the thing im most proud of
8064653 i believe very strongly that building sustainable local economies is about our survival in the age of climate change and peak oil which will increasingly disrupt and weaken long distance supply lines
8064654 when i opened white dog id never heard of words like
8064655 i think its a good thing people have heightened awareness about the importance of protecting the environment
8064656 there are much larger changes that must come changing our rate of consumption eliminating waste moving from cars to public transportation bicycling and walking buying fewer clothes insulating our buildings and reducing energy use
8064657 i believe strongly that were beginning to transition away from a global economy controlled by multinationals and based on import dependency and toward a new economy that is locally based green and self reliant in basic needs
8064658 i see this as a joyful movement our society is hungry for meaningful relationships that come from strong communities and there is real joy in working collaboratively toward a shared vision
8064659 if the instructions say to use only a dime sized portion do that
8064660 theres a reason it says that i even tell my clients to water it down sometimes
8064661 an organic cotton t shirt that was made in china and shipped to california and then flown to new york and then driven to philadelphia isnt really very green
8064662 recently ive been trying to find clothing made as close to home as possible
8064663 it was all sorts of chemicals i couldnt pronounce any of the ingredients
8064664 theres a lot of waste in the world especially with pets
8064665 the dogs can only play with the toy for so long before they destroy them and most of them get thrown out
8064666 whats fun is that every bed has a tag on it that tells you how many soda bottles were used to make the bed those are very popular
8064667 there was nowhere in philadelphia to buy natural pet products
8064668 we have all natural house cleaners because say if youre mopping your floor and your pet steps on it hell lick his paws and ingest whatever cleaning product you were using
8064669 tell us by what authority are you doing these things or who is he who gave you this authority
8064670 i also will ask you one thing and answer me the baptism of john was it from heaven or from men
8064671 if we say from heaven he will say why then did you not believe him but if we say from men all the people will stone us for they are persuaded that john was a prophet
8064672 neither will i tell you by what authority i do these things
8064673 a certain man planted a vineyard leased it to vinedressers and went into a far country for a long time
8064674 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
8064675 this will change the way california views the pacific ocean
8064676 the pacific is now becoming a meaningful part of californias water portfolio
8064677 hopefully other projects wont take as long because were the first ones through so weve been exposed rightly to more scrutiny
8064678 seawater desalting is finally coming into play its the most expensive way to produce water for drinking purposes so people have waited until the economics of seawater desalting became feasible for places like southern california and arizona
8064679 thanks for the nice piece on aep in todays publication you explained it correctly really got it right in my experience thats all too rare among even the most professional of journalists
8064680 the environmental movement had never included always been kept separate
8064681 but it does make me feel hopeful about my future because im not as dependent on the government on a large income on a lot of things that are just so unsteady right now
8064682 when people have religious experiences they can afterward be interpreted as mental illness episodes
8064683 thats a real problem it delegitimizes any spiritual experience it says based on our norms you are not normal you need to be fixed they could be being talked to by god why would you want to fix that
8064684 having less makes your life so much richer because it makes you appreciate what you actually have
8064685 americans are living in a way thats not sustainable our resources are becoming more scarce we have to make do with less
8064686 philadelphia has all the ingredients to become a truly bicycle friendly community
8064687 the gaps where there are no bike lanes have the largest amounts of crashes
8064688 a lot of police officers are not fully educated on the rights of bicyclists
8064689 bicyclists get mad at the motorists motorists get mad at the bicyclists and pedestrians get upset with both
8064690 everyone needs to follow the traffic law or they should be ticketed
8064691 motorists cant cut around cyclists and cyclists need to signal before they turn everyone is accountable
8064692 where traffic volume is very strong like on columbus boulevard
8064693 the best way we can improve bicycle safety is to get out there and ride our bicycles
8064694 both chefs at izakaya its an honor and a privilege to work under chefs who are so talented and willing to teach in return for hard work and have a true passion for cooking
8064695 the fact that my career is a hobby to me and that i do something with my time that im truly passionate about and can always keep learning about growing as a chef and a cook every day makes me happy
8064696 dry aged new york strip with sauce bordelaise that i make
8064697 i worked in the deli business for a while and decided to actually do something in this field so i attended the french culinary institute in n y c
8064698 putting out food in a consistent manner under great stress theres something about being busy that puts my mind at ease and in that moment all that truly matters in life is that task at hand
8064699 always work for chefs who are willing to teach you but always work as hard as you possibly can for them in return for that knowledge never take a job where you make more money but learn less always work for a chef who understands your goals and make sure the chef looks out for your best interests its a horrible business but if you can find that stick with it like i have always be open to learn from every experience and last but not least if you dont love what youre doing then youre in the wrong line of work
8064700 we believe endwar will revolutionize the strategy genre on consoles and are thrilled gamers will be able to get a little taste of why we are so excited about endwars release this holiday season
8064701 with its innovative voice command and intuitive game design fans will be able to learn first hand how a console game was able to win the judges over and win best strategy game of e3 for the first time in a category previously dominated by pc titles
8064702 i feel these nagging feminist pains why is this woman and why is
8064703 i really enjoyed listening to her in regards to telling us about barack in the ways that we dont see him
8064704 i thought it was a heartfelt speech and she really did a great job talking about her family life
8064705 the purpose was of course to provide a picture of barack obama the husband the father the best friend
8064706 something that looks good on you and something that looks for the occasion if you can combine those two things youve got the essence of style
8064707 the visual is as much of an impact as the verbal
8064708 so its not just what you say its what you look like saying it
8064709 weve seen the hillary pants suits weve seen the laura bush oscar de la renta easter suits they call them so this is really refreshingly different
8064710 ii would have liked to hear a bit more outside of community organizing on what it is that has really driven barack obama to seek public office
8064711 i think more than anything its just a big morale booster
8064712 a lot of people are down a lot of people are having to relocate
8064713 i think that we can get something accomplished now that we know that somebody is really concerned about us
8064714 i spent more than half my life working on these planes and its all going down the tube
8064715 americans offering an early retirement i dont want to but im taking it
8064716 i was a hillary supporter but when she lost the battle that was it im obama and im obama 110 percent
8064717 its a huge issue its at least as big an issue as the dns issue if not bigger
8064718 i went around screaming my head about this about ten or twelve years ago we described this to intelligence agencies and to the national security council in detail
8064719 theres no vulnerabilities no protocol errors there are no software problems the problem arises from the level of interconnectivity thats needed to maintain this mess to keep it all working
8064720 everyone has assumed until now that you have to break something for a hijack to be useful
8064721 but what we showed here is that you dont have to break anything and if nothing breaks who notices
8064722 the rate of bgp path updates goes up by a factor of 200 to 400
8064723 they simply dont because it takes work and to do sufficient filtering to prevent these kinds of attacks on a global scale is cost prohibitive
8064724 that means that nobody could put themselves into the chain into the path unless they had been authorized to do so by the preceding as router in the path
8064725 we havent seen the attacks and so a lot of times people dont start working on things and trying to fix them until they get attacked
8064726 but the youtube case is the perfect example of an attack where somebody could have done much worse than what they did
8064727 the only thing that can force them to fix bgp is if their customers start to demand security solutions
8064728 this is a museum about what is happening to us now the present and what will be happening to us in the future
8064729 did not give a compelling speech compared to say zell miller
8064730 well zell set his hair on fire and ran around the room
8064731 i definitely broke the cycle with my children one hundred percent
8064732 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
8064733 the gains that occurred last year were welcome but unfortunately they are too little too late
8064734 the median household is no better off now than they were back in 2000 despite their deep contribution to the nations economic growth during this period
8064735 the american work force is baking a bigger economic pie but the slices havent grown at all
8064736 its clear that the long period of strong economic growth we were in had a positive impact for most americans
8064737 obviously today were dealing with higher energy prices and the downturn in housing but the economy is showing enough resilience to keep growing in spite of those challenges
8064738 too many of our neighbors are living in poverty too many cant find a job and too many are living without health insurance
8064739 presidents like to take credit when things go well and therefore they should get the blame when things dont go well but there are lots of things driving this not all of which are home grown
8064740 the oil shocks are not and globalization which on balance is good for the country leaves winners and losers
8064741 private insurance has been falling and public insurance definitely went up
8064742 the number of uninsured is considerably higher than when the president took office and in each year since then employer sponsored insurance has continued to diminish
8064743 i think its more like we are seeing a tide that i dont think anybody can easily fix particularly in the small business sector
8064744 pacientul a ajuns la noi in soc hemoragic cu plagi taiate la nivelul antebratului sting si a intrat direct in sala de operatii se pare ca s a taiat cind incerca sa deschida un geam dar a trecut direct prin el
8064745 daca am fi membri nato atunci nu ar mai trebui sa ne facem griji ca alianta va ataca romania din cauza relatiei cu minoritatea maghiara asa cum a facut o in cazul iugoslaviei
8064746 daca de aceea vreti sa aderati la nato atunci o sa ma asigur ca nu veti reusi nicodata
8064747 au avut dreptate atunci cind partidul de opozitie a ajuns la putere un an mai tirziu partidul maghiar a sustinut noul guvern in 2004 romania a devenit membra nato si a avut sustinerea lui biden
8064748 ceea ce m a frapat la biden a fost franchetea si pasiunea sa pe care le punea in slujba politicii externe a sua stia cind si cum sa spuna lucrurilor pe nume iar romanii l au apreciat pentru acest lucru
8064749 de ce e atit de suparat omul acesta arata de parca i s ar fi inecat toate corabiile cred ca se confrunta cu mari probleme stii care sint acestea
8064750 avem dreptul sa le blocam accesul la complexul comercial totusi este intrarea in municipiu cei de la era mai au nevoie de autorizatii pentru a definitiva complexul
8064751 decizia este clara sa radem rondul complet si sa facem un alt proiect cind va functiona tot complexul acolo vor fi blocaje in trafic noul proiect va trebui sa nu afecteze deloc ecartamentul drumului national
8064752 rondul asa cum este acum este o prostie si trebuie sa fie demolat daca au facut o pasarela pot sa faca si un rond drumul national trebuie sa ramina la fel in latime accesul la era trebuie obtinut printr o supralargire nu prin diminuarea drumului national
8064753 exista citeva solutii pentru acea intersectie una dintre ele presupune o banda de preselectie linga axul drumului pentru virajul la stinga pentru cei care doresc sa ajunga la era si vin dinspre municipiu acea banda trebuie facuta pe o lungime destul de mare sa incapa in jur de 10 15 masini ar trebui si un semafor acolo
8064754 asa s ar evita tot drumul european accesul la era s ar face de undeva din canta apoi pe acest drum
8064755 motociclistii vor putea circula pe bulevardul socola dar nu vom accepta curse de masini sau motociclete in oras au mai fost persoane care au solicitat eliminarea spinarilor de magar din oras dar nu se poate mi s a spus ca s au intimplat multe accidente de exemplu in zona moara de vint pentru ca existau intreceri intre masini in plus vom instala pe toate bulevardele camere video care vor fi gestionate de politia rutiera in special pe bulevardele unde se stie ca se fac curse noaptea
8064756 acum masinile pleaca la examen din fata stadionului emil alexandrescu in doua saptamini au timp sa se gindeasca si sa mute acest punct de plecare le am oferit si doua variante una pe poitiers in apropiere de tirgul de cherestea si alta la fostul poligon din bucium directia tehnica impreuna cu politia rutiera va extinde si perimetrul interzis masinilor de scoala in timpul cursurilor actualul perimetru avea in vedere alte conditii de trafic de acum citiva ani
8064757 practic toate partile sint convinse de necesitatea revenirii la principiile de care au fost atit de aproape in 2003 lucram la asta impreuna cu reprezentantii chisinaului si ai tiraspolului cu observatorii sperind ca va fi realizat un progres intr un interval destul de scurt de timp
8064758 principii de baza ale structurii de stat a statului unificat
8064759 you can do so much better than this you can tell yourself youre doing your best
8064760 am semnat decretele privind recunoasterea independentei abhaziei si osetiei de sud tinind cont de dorinta popoarelor oset si abhaz si conform cartei onu declaratiei din 1970 despre principiile de drept international cu privire la relatiile amicale si de cooperare intre state conform actului final de la helsinki din 1975 si altor documente fundamentale internationale

8064782 inca din luna aprilie chinezii s au aratat interesati de gazduirea unei editii a cupei mondiale la fotbal
8064783 e un joc foarte important si la fel de important sint modul de concentrare si atitudinea pe care jucatorii le vor avea va conta mult si forma in care acestia vor fi nu este deloc un meci usor dar forta echipei a dovedit ca in meciurile importante au reusit sa se adune si sa obtina rezultatele dorite intilnim o echipa buna cu jucatori valorosi si experinta bogata la nivelul jocurilor internationale eu ma bazez in primul rind pe reactia pe care o vor avea fotbalistii nostri miine si pe faptul ca au mai trecut ca grup prin asa ceva
8064784 sintem mult mai bine pregatiti decit in tur rezultatul din primul meci este favorabil stelei dar sper ca noi sa fim cei care vom cistiga imi doresc sa fim mai buni decit la istanbul desi avem citiva jucatori accidentati am jucat bine in tur apoi am avut meciuri din ce in ce mai reusite si odata cu revenirea lui kewell sper sa evoluam si mai bine

8064794 e clar ca gazdele au prima sansa valoarea echipei campioane nemaitrebuind a fi amintita chiar daca nu a pornit prea grozav in acest sezon in situatia noastra insa nu ne permitem sa privim nici un meci ca dinainte pierdut trebuie sa ne agatam de orice sansa pentru a nu mai avea cifra 0 la punctele din clasament

8064830 when you look back historically torontos been a graveyard for young defencemen that maybe shouldnt have been integrated into the nhl lineup as early as they were
8064831 when you look at your top two lines were going to have a lot of young players there this year

8064881 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me

8064883 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
8064884 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
8064885 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
8064886 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking

8064892 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
8064893 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
8064894 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise

8064901 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really

8064919 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
8064920 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
8064921 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
8064922 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
8064923 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
8064924 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
8064925 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
8064926 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
8064927 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
8064928 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
8064929 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
8064930 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
8064931 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
8064932 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
8064933 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
8064934 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
8064935 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
8064936 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
8064937 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
8064938 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
8064939 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
8064940 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
8064941 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
8064942 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
8064943 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
8064944 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
8064945 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
8064946 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
8064947 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
8064948 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
8064949 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
8064950 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
8064951 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
8064952 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
8064953 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
8064954 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me

8064976 some theologians to speculate that specifically human life capable of receiving an immortal soul may not exist until a few weeks into pregnancy while in canon law these theories led to a distinction in penalties between very early and later abortions the churchs moral teaching never justified or permitted abortion at any stage of development
8064977 agrees with the church that we should reduce the number of abortions
8064978 we didnt look too far into it but you could tell he was dead sgt nazario was returning his weapon to the ready

8064980 this man just took my chair knocked into me look at this
8064981 i am a clinton delegate and these obama delegates are mistreating us
8064982 alabama i guess i just have this feeling that there is lingering prejudices there but maybe thats totally unfair on my part
8064983 oh michigan definitely its a good thing they didnt seat us near them
8064984 i had a dream i could buy my way to heaven when i awoke i spent that on a necklace
8064985 i believe we all communicate so well as a band because we are all the best of friends and have the same interests in music
8064986 its hard to say what our generation is about since the music scenes are so vast
8064987 the one thing we always try to do through our music is teach society not to be ignorant
8064988 i think they are a wonderful group of talented musicians and are going to go very far with their music
8064989 its surreal its definitely surreal to come back to beach high
8064990 this is where we grew up playing music were here to give it all back and show beach high just how we have progressed
8064991 hey lets go and see penny rimbaud out of crass live in stoke newington
8064992 we are in the process of finding a lawyer willing to help him
8064993 if theres a trial on thursday we will try to be present for that if we can
8064994 no pasa nada podeis bajar lo que querais de la mula
8064995 me gusta su forma de encarar apunta al medio de los ojos no tiene t rmino medio va y te encara te apunta en el medio de la frente y te va adentro
8064996 el grupo hasta ahora lo nico que hizo fue invertir con dalessandro perdimos plata se recuper algo con
8064997 explic ranucci lo cierto es que russo no sabe si podr seguir contando con bergessio debido a que la prioridad del grupo es venderlo a europa si llega una buena oferta que les asegure una ganancia
8064998 when youve been involved in something like this no matter how long ago it happened no matter how long its been absent from the news youre fated nonetheless to always search it out to be on alert for it somehow every day of your life for the small item at the back of the newspaper for the stranger at the cocktail party or the unfamiliar letter in the mailbox for the reckoning pause on the other end of the phone line for the dreadful reappearance of something that in all likelihood is never going to return
8064999 they put on their pants one leg at a time
8065000 is that something your father used to say sir i think i saw him at the service didnt i
8065001 but my mother doesnt agree she thinks powerful men have to put them on faster
8065002 senator bonwiller was important in my life im going to want to spend some time alone here today
8065003 i understand sir you see anybody in particular im supposed to recognize
8065004 thats a good start and a whole lot of congressmen but youre going to have to snoop around a bit on your own trieste find someone to ask thats one of the things reporters do more reliable than how big the people look
8065005 got it this water is nice and cold sir isnt it wakes you up
8065006 thanks trieste that would be nice and by the way
8065007 look around everyone else is in a suit or a dark dress this is a senators funeral
8065008 the most remarkable speech i have heard in my life
8065009 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
8065010 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8065011 this has nothing to do with whats going on now

8065015 as i said to jim gates not only no but hell no
8065016 we have not had any discussions with the city about ownership
8065017 it doesnt serve a trunk highway purpose and thats our reason to own a bridge
8065018 we dont own long meadow lake we dont think we should own the new cedar bridge
8065019 we generally do not take ownership of those structures unless it is absolutely necessary to the management of the refuge which in this case it is not
8065020 we want to plant the seed get folks thinking about it
8065021 why delay the inevitable allow nature to take its course
8065022 give a man a fish and hell eat for a day teach a man to fish and hell eat forever
8065023 gave a misleading impression of the state of scientific opinion on the issue
8065024 first the itu international telecommunications union accepts wimax as a 3g standard and now one of the largest networking vendors in the world shows its faith in the technology and in business models behind wimax
8065025 it also creates competitive pressure on other well known players in the market such as alcatel lucent and nortel it is one thing for those companies bid against navini for a large scale deployment but another thing to go against cisco
8065026 no one ever predicted that clownfish would be attracted to the scent of leaves i just figured they might like beach water
8065027 i saw the islands had heavy vegetation and i said lets give it a shot
8065028 its really easy to speculate that without the leaves clownfish might not be able to find their homes
8065029 off any island therell be eddies and currents that pull leaves out a fair ways from islands
8065030 i dont know what you are worried about were coming back we are going to win this game
8065031 loaning money to any relative without defining the specific terms for repayment is not a loan its a gift
8065032 unfortunately financial transactions between family members often turn into a power play as situations are manipulated for personal advantage
8065033 having a conversation about the repayment plan between you and your brother at this point should first focus on the facts just the facts
8065034 ask him what date will the money be repaid in what amount s
8065035 you can work through your anger and your brother can demonstrate accountability by repaying the loaned money
8065036 of course ill hold your hand in public and introduce you to people i know as my womanfriend cus youre not a girl youre a woman and were in a monogamous relationship together just you and me
8065037 when i went into college i didnt know what a bond was or a stock or an investment my dad didnt know we never discussed it
8065038 i wasnt even sure what a mortgage was and im not a slow fella
8065039 thats particularly important as companies walk away from dedicated pension plans
8065040 america is not prepared for that to happen you will never get it passed we are different and independent in a way that other countries arent
8065041 you dont want someone like me in your health care plan
8065042 im not proud to be one of those guys but a lot of people are subject to catastrophic illnesses
8065043 in order to be able to get the american people to make gigantic change you have to be able to demonstrate two things one you have to be able to reach across the aisle democrat or republican and pick up 15 percent of the opposition
8065044 second you have to make it understandable and reasonable for intelligent americans to say this is possible this is pragmatic
8065045 but weve known this were not investing in our kids the way we should
8065046 we should be investing in schools that dont perform well
8065047 if i finish in the top three or close fourth im in the game coming into new hampshire if i dont im gone
8065048 first second or an indistinguishable third in iowa to tell you the truth if i dont then this has been a nice exercise and ill see you again when you come to visit washington
8065049 we know how to do block and tackle we know how to do local politics we have enough money to compete in the arenas that were in
8065050 we reacted out of fear for our lives and we reacted with total destruction
8065051 over time as the absurdity of war set in individuals from my unit indiscriminately opened fire at vehicles driving down the wrong side of the road
8065052 people in my unit would later brag about it i remember thinking how appalled i was that we were laughing at this but that was the reality
8065053 for starters rudy rarely reads prepared speeches and when he does he isnt prone to ripping off the text of others
8065054 how that prepares a candidate for the challenges that the country is facing
8065055 if i end up with the numbers the way you just read them in the national poll sure im out of the race
8065056 but im not going to end up that way i may surprise you all
8065057 were near the end of the year and there really isnt much to show for it
8065058 there was this cute girl and i think she might have been interested in me my friend introduced us but i was so self conscious i didnt know what to say i talked about my work and where i live i made some jokes but i couldnt get them to come out right and im not sure i like what i was wearing i mean it was ok but my shirt was kind of dorky anyway i need your help how do i make sure im coming across well
8065059 is it what about calling her up and asking how shes feeling lately is the miscarriage still on her mind would she like to talk about it
8065060 you tell us to be mindful of our thoughts to watch them as they arise play out and pass away i dont seem to be able to do that when i notice a thought it disappears there is nothing to watch its as if i hit each thought with a baseball bat and knock it out of the park out of my mind
8065061 aspire to relax or to allow your thoughts then be curious about whatever happens instead
8065062 i wanted to tell you that i think the most valuable thing you ever said to me in therapy was that you let your kids be right half the time
8065063 why would you tell him the opposite of what you actually feel
8065064 are you ok you seem out of sorts anything bothering you
8065065 can i change mind can we get back together no i dont know what happened
8065066 know theres a lesson in there somewhere im gonna think about it later right now im miles away
8065067 youre about to say something but im not done let me finish
8065068 youve got this pretty well figured out on your own is there any way i can be of use
8065069 why are you interrupting cant you stay out of it
8065070 what happened was that i had a scene with mark knopfler and it got to the point where he couldnt handle it
8065071 oh romeo yeah you know i used to have a scene with him
8065072 i know what you mean its your wife now but as your son gets older there are going to be so many times you have to restrain yourself from helping him out
8065073 i know what you mean its your wife now but as your son gets older there are going to be so many times you have to restrain yourself from helping out
8065074 just therapy ive got the other covered with the deans and the attorneys
8065075 yes definitely its getting better i think itll just take some time to trust
8065076 i guess i didnt think youd see me if i told you i had an ulterior motive
8065077 on the 540 the franchise tax board has started to ask for state tax on your out of state internet purchases
8065078 the man in the suit has just bought a new car on the profit hes made on your dreams
8065079 i guess weve come to the end of the trail
8065080 i only do it cause i have to why do i need to ask your permission
8065081 roger i dont think joanne wants you to ask her permission she wants you to check with her am i right joanne
8065082 maybe 9 times out of 10 ill say sure thanks for asking but i need to know that 1 time out of 10 i can say tonites not a good nite my sister just dropped her kids off or we really need to talk or whatever can you go in to work early tomorrow instead and know that youll be receptive

8065085 i was reading this magazine in your waiting room may i borrow it
8065086 would you mind if i asked you to pass the salt
8065087 yourre tired dear under the eyes youve been sleeping poorly
8065088 its so embarrassing its almost funny i was so into carlos i could go down on him for hours so 6 months after we break up he tells me he never even liked it i never guessed
8065089 i claim this land in the name of the king
8065090 my patient picked up a pen from my desk and starting chewing on it as we were talking
8065091 the hidden benefits of disorder how crammed closets cluttered offices and on the fly planning make the world a better place
8065092 if this is going to be all heavy then id rather not walk
8065093 i dont want to have to be careful to ask do you still want to
8065094 i know we planned this walk but im not up for anything heavy today can we do it some other time
8065095 now go see the oncologist and compare which of our approaches feels more promising
8065096 darias husband you remember doug called to tell me hes throwing a surprise birthday party for daria and he wants me to watch the kids for the evening i told him shes my best friend im not comfortable not going so he told me theres only room for 16 what im not one of the 16 i told him fuck you find your own baby sitter and then i hung up on him he called me back the next day and said as if wed now agreed i was coming what i need you to do is pick up the cake silverware cases of beer and wine if you can bring those things you can eat with the band so what if the band is famous i dont care about that
8065097 i told him to ask the rest of us first next time
8065098 this is the way presuming works this is the way the world works
8065099 these are the associates i told you about they came to watch you dance
8065100 in situations like yours it can help a great deal if you have someone to talk with we can sign you up for free care the drugs can only do so much
8065101 it really is recommended in almost all cases such as this that a patient undergo some kind of therapy and given the extremity
8065102 then dr vishnubakar said can i ask you a question and i said depends and he said do you miss your father and i said i dont really remember him and he said i think it would be very hard to lose your father and i didnt say anything if you want to know why i didnt say anything its because i dont like it when anyone talks about dad unless they knew him
8065103 hey that was embarrassing ill tell them about my dream if i want to
8065104 i told w that id like to go to the desert sometime and he said whatre we going to do there nothing happening there i go skiing with him 4 or 5 times a winter i dont even like skiing
8065105 i would advise you against defensiveness on principle it precludes the best eventualities along with the worst at the most basic level it expresses a lack of faith
8065106 well i said something third person a bit sarcastically to jim something like
8065107 my mom raised her eyebrows but nothing more i was pretty subtle
8065108 wants to fix things if someone complains if i told my mom she was being an asshole like suzie does on the show my mom would get affronted shed leave or not talk to us for months
8065109 when is this sitting going to end bored bored bored oh actually its that i dont like being bored so aversion aversion
8065110 i dont want to hear assessments of my character when youre angry or critical
8065111 i was going to make those changes anyway why do i care that my manager proposes them
8065112 and why do i even care in the first place its such a minor report
8065113 did you think i couldnt come up with those on my own
8065114 i think i told him pretty nicely too i wasnt mean about it but he still told me that i was being too sensitive that its the hosts place to offer the ride and he was the host i told him i thought most women would be jealous in that situation but he just disagreed i dont have any impact on him its depressing
8065115 if youre openly attacked or subtly denigrated stand up for yourself
8065116 do you think telling someone that they are defensive helps them or actually makes them even more defensive
8065117 we seem to be in completely different states of mind
8065118 my father is visiting from new york i drive out to get lunch for all of us i come back into the kitchen and theres dad eating all the left over chinese food so i say cant you leave some for the rest of us and besides i told you i was going out for food and he says but i like chinese better so later leslie corners me and says dont yell at your dad dont you think its ok to tell my dad how i feel
8065119 well i dont know sir i guess theyll be there soon

8065121 ahhhh for a project like this you first need approval from sanitation
8065122 you dont hit your kid you dont hit your kid
8065123 look at all those atm fees youre paying you should get cash at your own branch where its free
8065124 he helps me out financially while in in school we have a joint account so he can make deposits
8065125 well he came in and asked my opinion so i said do you think youre finished and he didnt say much and we got stuck any suggestions
8065126 my husband is so sure i want sex to be intense
8065127 my date was going pretty well until we got to the restaurant and he ordered my dinner for me

8065129 i tried to ask what would be the best time for him
8065130 19 times out of 20 im on your side this time i agree with sam well not that he should split the check you have a good point there and not that you were critical i understand that you were trying to be helpful but rather its his birthday so its his call
8065131 yeah if hed said thanks i can handle this one myself i would have understood and backed off
8065132 those panics just might be the only real touch he has right now with his inner aliveness those panics are the frantic signals of his lost subjective center
8065133 no thats the funny thing ive flown before and im usually fine well maybe a little nervous but nothing big
8065134 well id just been staying with my dad and we didnt get along at all
8065135 im just so unreasonable i tell myself that nothings going to happen i mean what are the odds the weathers fine

8065141 well im going to pick up ice and i get to the liquor store and they dont have any and i start driving to the next place but im getting lost and now the neighborhoods the western addition and its getting dark and well its a bit scary
8065142 well eventually thats what i did and it worked out

8065150 duh no dude the songs not to jesus cause its uh like sung to a woman
8065151 the fundamentalists take the bible literally so for them jesus is always a man for mystical christians like me its about having a direct relationship with god and with jesus so whatever helps that dialogue is good there are records back at least as far as the 1400s of mystics speaking to jesus as mother and some of my clients talk to jesus the woman not jesus the mother

8065159 it is not at all surprising that the communist partys censorship agency banned coverage of demonstrations by pro tibetan groups or the existence of designated protest areas in beijing but the instructions regarding food security and the chinese teams results are astounding
8065160 we call on the international olympic committee to investigate this censorship directive which is both a violation of the commitments given in 2001 and yet another infringement of the free flow of news in china
8065161 le contenu des 21 directives adress es par le d partement de la propagande aux m dias chinois r v le quel point la couverture des jeux olympiques tait biais e et politique il ny a rien d tonnant ce que lorgane du parti communiste chinois charg de la censure interdise la diffusion dinformations sur les manifestations de groupes pro tib tains ou lexistence de zones pour manifester p kin en revanche les consignes sur la s curit alimentaire ou les r sultats de l quipe chinoises sont stup fiantes nous demandons au comit international olympique de mener une enqu te sur ces directives officielles qui sont la fois une violation des engagements de 2001 et une nouvelle entorse la libre circulation de linformation en chine pour ne rien dire du m pris quelles r v lent pour lesprit olympique
8065162 el contenido de las 21 directivas dirigidas por el departamento de propaganda a los medios de comunicaci n chinos revela hasta qu punto la cobertura de los juegos ol mpicos ha sido sesgada y pol tica no resulta nada sorprendente que el rgano de censura del partido comunista chino haya prohibido la diffusion de informaciones sobre las manifestaciones de grupos pro tibetanos o la existencia de zonas para manifestarse en pek n pero en cambio nos dejan estupefactos las consignas sobre la seguridad alimentaria o los resultados del equipo chino pedimos al comit ol mpico internacional que efect e una investigaci n sobre ese tipo de censura que es a la vez una violaci n de los compromisos de 2001 y un obst culo m s a la libre circulaci n de la informaci n en china

8065180 organizations cant just traipse out into the social realm in the same way that individuals like you and i can
8065181 these vestigial theories of traditional marketing and branding are ingrained with concepts that are rendering most organizations conversationally impotent in todays marketplace the new marketers know this that in the customers view every person employed by an organization is the organization this is true whether at the cashiers desk on the phone with the call center and even in the webs social media hangouts so although organizations themselves are not living breathing individuals they are made up of living breathing humans so i say organizations should give their humans the right to act like it ill take it a step farther organizations should encourage their humans to act like it express their personality show some empathy deviate from the script and so on

8065233 if you are a member of the aog and this causes you to be able to see that the leadership is no all knowing good if you are part of planetshakers and this causes you to learn that you are responsible or your own theology good if this causes you to question the text of the next sermon you hear moreover if it causes you to actually go to the bible and see the biblical passages quoted in context good

8065244 we hope the documentary will help the public know more about the world and what happened in these countries
8065245 this documentary has been a long time on the drawing boards
8065246 but what is a great power how does a nation become a great power these are critical questions making the documentary was a search for answers
8065247 sometimes history is distorted or poorly recounted thats why misunderstandings and false concepts exist among the public
8065248 this documentary describes world history seriously and helps the audience understands historical events
8065249 the cpc lecture helped inspire us to make the documentary
8065250 the documentary is quite objective a far cry from the stereotypical rhetoric we heard when we were younger
8065251 i do not think we are introducing a new historical concept
8065252 as china opens up to the outside world we need a more rational understanding of the world
8065253 what happened in history cannot be changed there are skeletons in the closet of all these great powers
8065254 before we probably paid too much attention to the vicious aspects of these great powers to some extent we ignored their successful experience and achievements
8065255 now more and more people are trying to view the world in an objective way which shows that china can take a more open and rational attitude towards the world
8065256 according to an old chinese saying if you use history as a mirror you can understand the vicissitudes of life
8065257 history helps us understand what development path a country has chosen and its experiences and lessons this helps us understand what we should do
8065258 wars did accompany the rise of the united states but we cannot say it became powerful through war
8065259 the notion that the rise of a world power is inevitably accompanied by wars is erroneous
8065260 every country has to follow its own course although other countries experiences and lessons can be useful
8065261 in my opinion the successful experiences of these countries have much in common
8065262 on the one hand you have to respect tradition on the other you must have the courage to innovate thats what i learned from these 500 years of history
8065263 the other thing i really liked the most pause then continue

8065312 a guy who wants to respect girls is distracted by sexy clothes and remembers her for one thing is it fair that guys are turned on by their senses and women by their hearts
8065313 one thing that sex education and the media fail to communicate is the power of sex spies who are trained not to give away government secrets even lose their sensibilities and give in to the power of sex often because of what a woman is wearing
8065314 these are simply natural consequences for example if you eat spoiled food you will get sick if you jump from a tall building you will be hurt or killed if you spend more money than you make your enslavement to debt affects you and those whom you love if you have sex outside of marriage there are consequences for you your partner and society

8065350 for the first time in my career the way that my music can reach my fans is unlimited ive never wanted to think in a limited way and with this new partnership the possibilities are endless who knows how my albums will be distributed in the future thats whats exciting about this deal everything is possible live nation has offered me a true partnership and after 25 years in the business i feel that i deserve that
8065351 madonna is a true icon and maverick as an artist and in business
8065352 our partnership is a defining moment in music history i am thrilled that madonna who is also now a shareholder in our company has joined with us to create a new business model for our industry bringing all the varied elements of madonnas stunning music career into the artist nation and live nation family moves her future and the future of our company into a unique and extraordinary place
8065353 madonna is without a doubt one of the most fiercely original artists in history it is a great opportunity for live nation and artist nation to build upon our years of success with madonna as a touring artist
8065354 ive been fortunate enough to work with madonna for half my life she has always encouraged me and set a great example for me to push the boundaries to reach our full potential this partnership exemplifies just that
8065355 the partnership and vision for the future that artist nation along with live nation presented to us assured me that this is the ideal home for madonna it is with great trust and optimism that we collectively move ahead together
8065356 i am more convinced than ever that the face to face interactions in live communities cannot be replaced by online dialogue while the online forums provide us with a fantastic starting point we need to explore how the online social networking will serve and enable the face to face
8065357 we are re thinking the way the economic rule book works and reassessing economics in its original form as a branch of moral philosophy it means re thinking the role of regulation tax incentives market mechanisms and structural and governance innovations it means looking afresh at the financial system and why its current structures fail to invest actively in social purpose businesses
8065358 community led regeneration that builds rather than replaces the value and distinctiveness of local economies and communities local distinctiveness is wealth in itself but it also underpins economic success because as with ecosystems a diverse locality is resilient to shocks people also want to invest or live in places that seem real equally important is the way that resources flow into and through a local economy who controls that flow who benefits from it
8065359 we need a common online space where deliberation can take place
8065360 do fellows really want a deeper kind of engagement with the rsa nd november is a chance for us to work together on addressing these issues and will be founded on the key question what might new rsa networks do and how might they deliver
8065361 as fellows you are fully engaged at every step of the process as collaborators and co creators along with the staff of the organisation so please treat the thinking here as a springboard for your own views and ideas challenge it develop it and add to it
8065362 as i said to jim gates not only no but hell no
8065363 we have not had any discussions with the city about ownership
8065364 it doesnt serve a trunk highway purpose and thats our reason to own a bridge
8065365 we dont own long meadow lake we dont think we should own the new cedar bridge
8065366 we generally do not take ownership of those structures unless it is absolutely necessary to the management of the refuge which in this case it is not
8065367 we want to plant the seed get folks thinking about it
8065368 colored folded personalized informal thank you notes with matching envelope
8065369 did not see the current stance of policy as particularly accommodative
8065370 most participants anticipated that core inflation would edge back down during 2009
8065371 some viewed the upside risks to inflation as having diminished modestly mainly as a result of the drop in the prices of oil and some other commodities as well as the greater likelihood of persistent economic slack
8065372 a number of participants worried about the possibility that core inflation might fail to moderate next year unless the stance of monetary policy was tightened sooner than currently anticipated by financial markets
8065373 and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent
8065374 unambiguously challenge our view that the fed will start their tightening cycle still in december and it is getting more and more likely that we will see the first rate hike only at the beginning of 2009
8065375 were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability due to the effects of financial market strains as well as macroeconomic risks
8065376 jah soms kom ik wel eens handig uit de hoek maar ik kan ook wel klungelig doen
8065377 one of the things that we sensed was that students were not as engaged at the university as students were at other universities
8065378 we wanted to have some sort of intensive program that would really connect them to the university connect them with each other and connect them with the faculty and staff
8065379 contrary to what i hear a lot of institutions are doing
8065380 the movement generally across the country has been to reduce the amount of time between when students are allowed to move in and when classes actually start what weve found is that the more time you give the students the more time they have to see minneapolis in ways you might not want them to see minneapolis
8065381 we really thought about how we can get the students on campus give them the content they need and help them make the connections without it being a drinking fest
8065382 dorms food service transportation this all has to be paid for
8065383 its related to graduation because its going to connect students much earlier on with the array of opportunities they can have culturally socially or academically at the university that engagement and as quick as you can do it is really key to success in college today
8065384 research shows that the more the student is involved and engaged in student activities in leadership positions the better theyll do in their academic work and the sooner theyll graduate
8065385 thats not always self evident but we want to introduce them to these opportunities so maybe theyll realize gee maybe i should balance some of these outside the classroom opportunities

8065387 customer service is paramount to any technology company no longer build and they will come
8065388 there is huge excitement surrounding the sbsc and were responding in kind the feedback were receiving from customers and partners is crafting how we refine the program
8065389 we are learning what it takes to serve small business partners one of the interesting learnings is that we have a tendency to focus on sophisticated marketing campaigns but when it comes to sbsc members the basic sales tools perhaps extracted from our sophisticated campaigns are what partners are asking for
8065390 were focusing over the next year on mining our internal partner ecosystem to grow sbsc and you can also look forward to more soft skill training content from the sbsc team that will be less technical and more business skills focused
8065391 sbsc success is critical to microsofts success in the small business space
8065392 we were budgeting and everything and it was getting really close to going
8065393 but the new head of hbo felt it was just too dark and too violent and too controversial which of course is kind of the point
8065394 it was a very faithful adaptation of the first few books nearly word for word they offered me the chance to redevelop it but i refused ive learned my lesson on that front and i wont do it again so im afraid its dead at hbo
8065395 ive heard someone is in the process of getting the rights to turn it into a feature film i hope that happens but i hope it happens as a series of movies as one movie couldnt do it justice i really love that story and i dedicated a lot of my time to honor garths work but it wasnt meant to be
8065396 we want to resolve this situation as soon as we can in a way where we can guarantee the safety of all our passengers
8065397 i used to be the easy one i wanted my kids to like me now i realize as i have used your methods and am now on top of my discipline that my kids are liking respecting and loving me more than before
8065398 oh know what is going to happen to me when my mom or dad find out what i did gt it is reassuring and relieves anxiety did you ever think that consistent no nonsense discipline could be that beneficial the more parents i speak with and the more families i meet this is what i see the families that are functioning the best are the ones that have clear rules and expectations that are tied to consequences that are logical to the issue these parents are consistent do not back down and command respect from their kids and guess what these kids do not hate their parents the love and respect their parents because they really know that their parents are working hard to teach them what they need to know in this new complicated world that we live in so stop worrying about whether your kids will like you and give them what they need you to be on 100 of the time calling them on their misbehavior rate this article 1 2 3 4 5 current 0 5 stars 0 vote s article tags article reprint article source http www articlesbase com parenting articles do you want your child to like you 537499 html print article send to friend publish this article author feedback about the author susan p epstein lcsw parent life coach works with parents of unmanageable children wanting to get control of their family life she practiced psychotherapy for 23 years before becoming a parent coach writer and www parentingpowers com

8065440 while it takes an entire county board to deliver results like these commissioner turners legacy is that he helped build a culture of high expectations both in performance and continuous improvement that will live on
8065441 we balance the interest and the dollars that you spend against the needs of the county thats a tightrope
8065442 that is just one of his demonstrated great services that hes done for the people of burnsville
8065443 as an operational body you cant let those political ties get in the way of providing the citizens with good government
8065444 the county commissioner is a nonpartisan position and should stay that way
8065445 hes been a great leader in terms of developing more collaboration between the members of the criminal justice system
8065446 here is what the catechism of the catholic church says human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception
8065447 whether joe biden is as ignorant of what his religion teaches remains to be seen
8065448 so there we have it the man running for president on the democratic ticket supports selective infanticide his running mate is a pro abortion catholic the delegates are wildly out of step with americans on abortion and the speaker of the house hasnt a clue what her religion teaches on the subject
8065449 the government must not hastily push through the passage of the bill tt the way forward is to bring back english as the main medium of teaching rather than bm malaysian medical resources all rights reserved

8065455 tell ari you had a bad day and hell make you feel better
8065456 i was driving us to the bear and wolf area when i saw a car stopped right in front of me
8065457 there was a bear in front of it so i stopped too and started taking pictures
8065458 i saw it take a hubcap off the car then start walking towards us i locked all the doors quickly we didnt know what it would do
8065459 it put the hubcap down and then banged on the window as if it was trying to get my attention
8065460 im the top cat and you must bow to my superior ways
8065461 gee i cant find your name in the computer are you sure you had it towed here

8065463 i have no experience in running anything so big and complicated
8065464 well thats the idea this is a faculty run university we dont want professional managers making academic decisions

8065482 satisfied or dissatisfied with the way things are going in the united states at this time
8065483 things in this country are heading in the right direction or off on the wrong track
8065484 interpreting the results of these direction questions is a challenge for professional pollsters let alone more casual consumers of national media polls
8065485 a survey question should be worded so that every respondent is answering the same question
8065486 although the language of the survey questions can be standardized there is no guarantee that the meaning assigned to the questions is constant over respondents
8065487 a fundamental tenet of scientific measurement is that the measuring device is standardized over different objects being measured
8065488 even if the same question is asked at two different points in time is it really the same question the fact that times change may mean that the meaning of the question undergoes change

8065501 the walnut street baptist church louisville of which dr eaton of the western recorder is pastor has had some distillers in its membership it appears they entered into the business long ago when temperance sentiment was not what it is now and have never been convinced of the evil of their traffic the church has become weary with forbearing and has passed a resolution giving them a year to get out of their business or out of the church these members are wealthy and the church is considered therefore to have been put to quite a test of principles
8065502 the world is the devils hunting ground and children are his choicest game
8065503 the marvel of marvels is not that god in his infinite love has not elected

8065526 you have sort of a symbiotic relationship at first but then eventually the child becomes independent and eventually goes through the same process herself and she becomes the mother
8065527 sounds good sounds good so uh how do i spawn this thing do i like divide or something and how do we manifest the symbiosis exchange enzymes for a few years or something
8065528 ok so this is how it works she grows inside you for like nine months
8065529 are you serious alright well i guess it gets better after that then what
8065530 then now within her own small body she begins to grow and mature she will demand your attention as she does so requiring constant training and disciplining while also latching onto you physically periodically for sustenance but that part only last a couple of years
8065531 oh thank god and then what i guess i get to demand her attention and care for a couple of years
8065532 no no i meant the physical sustenance part only last a couple of years youll still have to train discipline and materially provide for her for the next 30 years or so
8065533 you know this is sounding more like a parasitic relationship than a symbiotic one

8065539 by the time the doors of the voronka opened cy was in darkness two men hoisted him by either arm and took him in stopping only at the receiving room cy stood as a clerk wrote down his name and the date and place of birth

8065545 my christian hunters returned today after a ten day absence they bring me a white bear which they took alive but unfortunately killed so that it could be carried more easily the young white bear which they sell me very dearly is all white except for the legs ears and around the eyes which are deep black the colours are the same as those i saw in the skin of an adult bear the other day at the home of li the hunter this must be a new species of ursus very remarkable not only because of its colour but also for its paws which are hairy underneath and for other characteristics
8065546 i have not seen this species which is easily the prettiest kind of animal i know in the museums of europe perhaps it is new to science
8065547 from our campsite we were able to watch a herd of big black monkeys which tried to climb the crest of the volcano we succeeded in killing two of these animals and with a rumbling noise they tumbled into a ravine which had its opening in a northeasterly direction after five hours of strenuous work we succeeded in retrieving one of these animals using a rope it was a big human like male monkey of one and a half metres in height and a weight of more than 200 pounds about 91 kilograms his chest had no hair and his hand and feet were of enormous size unfortunately i was unable to determine its type because of its size it could not very well be a chimpanzee or a gorilla and in any case the presence of gorillas had not been established in the area around the lakes

8065559 ruled as a sovereign over an estate that depended in virtually all respects upon the perpetual subordination of the people whose freedom labor hope and natural rights he was stealing
8065560 was a disciplined member of the landed gentry the aristocrat could be haughty and distant and overly fond of pomp he could also be worshipful of wealth and jealous of his property including his human property
8065561 he was a rather dreamy and self indulgent rural aristocrat
8065562 gave him the leisure to study to reflect and to write
8065563 he didnt have to be original it was the elegance of his prose fueled by his passion that moved human spirits and made him immortal

8065648 arriving at one goal is the starting point to another

8065651 whatever course you decide upon there is always someone to tell you that you are wrong there are always difficulties arising which tempt you to believe that your critics are right to map out a course of action and follow it to an end requires courage

8065657 the christian memory and heritage of the vast majority of member states
8065658 successive decisions which have undermined the family based on marriage the right to life from the moment of conception to natural death the sacredness of the sabbath the right of christian institutions to maintain and promote their ethos including schools these and other decisions have made it more difficult for committed christians to maintain their instinctive commitment to the european project
8065659 the claims and influence of secularism and relativism have gone largely unchallenged in irish culture and media it could be argued that they enjoy an uncritical acceptance which would never be afforded to religious faith
8065660 as the recent referendum on the lisbon treaty in ireland suggests at least some of those who were previously enthusiastic about the founding aims of the eu both social and economic are now expressing unease
8065661 being denied the right to intervene in public debates or at least having their contribution dismissed as an attempt to protect unjustified privileges such as for example the right to employ people who support the ethos of a christian institution
8065662 people of religious faith who may be natural enthusiasts of the concept of a european union increasingly approach european developments with scepticism
8065663 they have an expectation that a secular relativist and utilitarian approach dominates ethical considerations
8065664 worship without the release of the spirit is just exuberance
8065665 generations often think they have to worship separately wrong the church is a family and should work worship together
8065666 why have increased penalties for attacks on pregnant women if the not yet born baby doesnt matter either that child matters so that attacks on pregnant women are more heinous in which case bill c 484 is a direct recognition of that reality or that child doesnt matter in which case we dont need any new law the current provisions in the criminal code already cover the violence against the woman
8065667 the saddest thing of all is that the government bill likely adds nothing that doesnt already exist in law
8065668 i know the critics of c 484 will continue to spread misinformation but i continue to hope that thoughtful everyday canadians not influenced by political agendas or strident ideology will continue to support c 484 and about 70 of canadians do including the vast majority of women across the country
8065669 i hope they will continue to contact their mps now more than ever and encourage them to continue to support a compassionate and just response to the horrible loss experienced by pregnant women who lose their not yet born babies in a violent attack and i hope as a result mps regardless of party affiliation will have the courage to vote in favour of bill c 484 at third reading
8065670 i remember that and jesus please help me to be strong please help me to defeat this enemy that is trying so hard to steal my joy
8065671 the zeal was contagious at one point they had the crowd stomping in harmony telling them that their prayer had the power to stomp out the enemy to stomp out abortion
8065672 as a movement we believe we are building on a foundation that has been laid by so many who came before us and many who are now labouring shoulder to shoulder with us it is exciting to watch the hand of god so clearly moving in canada today
8065673 cry out for mercy mainly for the 50 million babies that have been killed through abortion
8065674 its easy to point fingers and blame people in this place but the problems that this country has are with us who claim we know the lord but have not lived it and not been as faithful
8065675 so repentance and revival cannot start in the building behind me until it starts in the temple inside me

8065680 let the little children come to me and do not hinder them for the kingdom of god belongs to such as these i tell you the truth
8065681 the kingdom of god does not come with your careful observation nor will people say here it is or there it is because the kingdom of god is within you
8065682 when you commission something youre merely placing it into service when you warrant something youre guaranteed it will work
8065683 when you commission something youre merely placing it into service when you warrant something youre guaranteed it will work

8065687 it has been one of those years of overcoming hurdles our whole offense with als leadership has been tested but up here youre judged on results in the nfl if things dont go well offensively and defensively thats what everybody is going to look at certainly i have responsibility in that and if youre a coordinator youre going to get some heat als been around long enough to know thats what happens up here

8065707 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment
8065708 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8065709 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8065710 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner
8065711 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8065712 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8065713 in this day and age where all these ballparks are being built now where people can reach out over the outfield fence and catch balls fan interference is becoming more and more of an issue
8065714 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8065715 it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times
8065716 thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8065717 i find it very strange that with 30 games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8065718 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time
8065719 some people thought that we ought to wait until the postseason
8065720 id rather go into the postseason knowing that weve already used it
8065721 so if the game is held up for a couple of minutes a couple of times a year i think thats ok
8065722 its certainly not going to be seen as often as it is in the nfl
8065723 i believe that because of the configuration of ballparks both new and old that is really much more difficult than it once was
8065724 i dont believe in the use of for other things
8065725 i just dont want it to open up with calls at home and calls at the bases and eventually behind the plate
8065726 we havent talked about that i think that thats unlikely over the term of this agreement
8065727 what well obviously do is look at it after the were hopeful that were going to say it was great
8065728 we talked to the technicians and he explained what theyre going to be doing
8065729 we have five american films in competition and most of those films are films with stars so in a way the strike only meant that some of the bigger studio films will only be released late december or january

8065750 we dont own the earth we borrow it from our children
8065751 we dont have much substantial investment here to capitalise on our rich natural environment
8065752 if all these projects are completed i believe the northern provinces will become much less isolated from the rest of the country
8065753 our aim is to improve the infrastructure of the 10 provinces within the triangle and allow residents to move freely as they do in large cities
8065754 we are badly in need of road infrastructure to improve cross border access and to capitalise further on the rising number of tourists arriving in stung treng from laos
8065755 here we have great potential for the production of rubber cassava cashews and other crops
8065756 i think it will help improve living conditions tourism and investment opportunities for all three nations
8065757 we want to see the lives of people in our countries dramatically improve

8065762 single use plastic water bottles are falling from fashion able to frowned upon
8065763 serving our local water in reusable carafes makes more sense for the environment than manufacturing thousands of single use glass bottles for someone to use once and throw away
8065764 filling cargo ships with water and sending it hundreds and thousands of miles to get it around the world seems ridiculous
8065765 with all the other things we do for sustainability it makes sense
8065766 it makes no sense because we have great well water
8065767 but i had no idea i was on the cutting edge
8065768 alice is very commendable and extraordinary and we look to her
8065769 serving tap water is a great idea that wed all love to be able to do but its not going to happen all at once
8065770 why would you do that not from a money standpoint but from a service and hospitality standpoint fifty to 60 percent prefer bottled water especially sparkling
8065771 the students were up in arms but a year later no one says anything
8065772 we have been marketed to the point that children believe they cant drink water out of the tap

8065804 it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8065805 i think its an overall belief system in our school district as well as our community
8065806 so if you set that high expectation if you set that goal of meeting the state indicators meeting ayp the value added components
8065807 when you set those as goals for people and hold them accountable for it i think youre going to achieve it
8065808 im confident that our teaching staff our families our students look forward to a great year and were going to take it on and take it for what its worth
8065809 the data is here for us to help us with continually improving
8065810 the important thing is that when were bringing all those pieces together that everybodys on the same page everybodys communicating in the same fashion and that theres a buy in to what were trying to do in the district which is that top level of achievement

8065821 the reason network was so funny was because it was so outrageous youre thinking cmon nobodys going to kill somebody on television are they and now we sort of think yeah we think so
8065822 the news division will be reduced from an independent division to a department accountable to network
8065823 i understand it was supposed to be a combination of drama and comedy but to us it was all comedy it was so overdrawn we howled with laughter

8065856 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment
8065857 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8065858 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8065859 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner
8065860 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8065861 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8065862 in this day and age where all these ballparks are being built now where people can reach out over the outfield fence and catch balls fan interference is becoming more and more of an issue
8065863 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8065864 it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times
8065865 thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8065866 i find it very strange that with 30 games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8065867 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time
8065868 some people thought that we ought to wait until the postseason
8065869 id rather go into the postseason knowing that weve already used it
8065870 so if the game is held up for a couple of minutes a couple of times a year i think thats ok
8065871 its certainly not going to be seen as often as it is in the nfl
8065872 i believe that because of the configuration of ballparks both new and old that calling home runs is really much more difficult than it once was
8065873 i dont believe in the use of instant replay for other things
8065874 i just dont want it to open up pandoras box with calls at home and calls at the bases and eventually behind the plate
8065875 we havent talked about that i think that thats unlikely over the term of this agreement
8065876 what well obviously do is look at it after the world series were hopeful that were going to say it was great
8065877 we talked to the technicians and he explained what theyre going to be doing
8065878 we are thrilled that this jury sent a strong message that they want these companies to compete in the marketplace and not the courtroom
8065879 this is good news and is entirely attributable to the availability of government programs like medicaid and the state childrens health insurance program schip
8065880 programs like schip and medicaid are lifelines for providing americans with the healthcare they need especially during times when the economy is soft and more people feel vulnerable to losing employer sponsored health insurance
8065881 while this decline is a temporary victory for kids we fear next years data will paint a worse picture for americas children than ever before as the effects of a sluggish economy will be coupled with the inability of congress to pass renewal of the state childrens health insurance program over president bushs two vetoes
8065882 an opportunity for the private sector and the government to work together
8065883 so a lot of businesses across the country are feeling they can not sustain the healthcare coverage they used to provide for their workers or they are requiring workers to pay more in premiums and deductibles and as a result many of the workers can no longer afford coverage
8065884 and more and more people are priced out of the healthcare they used to take for granted
8065885 many many studies are showing that even small levels of lead in the blood can increase the risk of high blood pressure kidney dysfunction and decreased iq
8065886 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
8065887 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
8065888 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
8065889 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
8065890 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
8065891 a lot of people think a gay greeting card needs a rainbow on it
8065892 what is scary is to produce a marriage line and then november comes and its recalled then we have thousands of dollars of inventory waiting
8065893 we wanted to provide our athletes the best equipment available and nautilus wanted to create a high profile presence in the region so we decided to work together to achieve both goals
8065894 working on the equipment has resulted in nothing but favorable feedback from both the players and staff and has fit nicely into our model of performance enhancement
8065895 with a brand new line of strength and cardiovascular equipment we are eager to introduce our innovative new products to clubs teams sports and community facilities along with corporate facilities and living complexes throughout the greater phoenix area and the desert southwest
8065896 we are raising the standard for customer service by hiring key personnel locally to represent our complete line in major markets with high demand for fitness equipment such as arizona
8065897 whats the big deal just put the fork down and back away
8065898 now about food sacrificed to idols we know that we all possess knowledge knowledge puffs up but love builds up
8065899 1 if you have any encouragement from being united with christ if any comfort from his love if any fellowship with the spirit if any tenderness and compassion 2 then make my joy complete by being like minded having the same love being one in spirit and purpose 3 do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit but in humility consider others better than yourselves 4 each of you should look not only to your own interests but also to the interests of others
8065900 food does not bring us near to god we are no worse if we do not eat and no better if we do
8065901 i have just finished 6 years of higher education in preparation for ministry and not had one course on leadership
8065902 for it is god who works in you to will and act according to his good purpose
8065903 to let life happen to you is irresponsible to create your day is your
8065904 when you start visualizing and feeling strongly about what you want you move toward it
8065905 without a clear understanding of direction youre unlikely to get where you want to go
8065906 you dont have to be great to get started but you do have to get started to be great

8065914 for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
8065915 do they really think they will get a positive response
8065916 this is not an easy choice but this is the only chance to save peoples lives
8065917 we expect russia to live up to its international commitments reconsider this irresponsible decision and follow the approach set out in the cease fire deal
8065918 we will have to react somehow to react of course in a military way
8065919 russia is making i would say a number of irrational decisions
8065920 we hope that they hear the loud voices from the international community and understand that its not in their long term interests to take these kinds of actions
8065921 the only place these people want to be is home and they cant go home because of what has happened to them and because of the situation that the russians have caused
8065922 we obviously cant allow what russias done to go without there being some consequences
8065923 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a
8065924 abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognized borders of georgia and its going to remain so
8065925 georgia chose the least human way to achieve its goal to absorb south ossetia by eliminating a whole nation
8065926 short of losing our dignity as a nation we couldnt act otherwise
8065927 but russian leaders are guilty too because they kept this conflict warm for many years and tried to use it as a political instrument

8065943 we have our engineers looking at it and were doing a complete investigation
8065944 were not going to let an unsafe condition exist its just going to be slower
8065945 the gains that occurred last year were welcome but unfortunately they are too little too late
8065946 the median household is no better off now than they were back in 2000 despite their deep contribution to the nations economic growth during this period
8065947 the american work force is baking a bigger economic pie but the slices havent grown at all
8065948 its clear that the long period of strong economic growth we were in had a positive impact for most americans
8065949 obviously today were dealing with higher energy prices and the downturn in housing but the economy is showing enough resilience to keep growing in spite of those challenges
8065950 too many of our neighbors are living in poverty too many cant find a job and too many are living without health insurance
8065951 presidents like to take credit when things go well and therefore they should get the blame when things dont go well but there are lots of things driving this not all of which are home grown
8065952 the oil shocks are not and globalization which on balance is good for the country leaves winners and losers
8065953 private insurance has been falling and public insurance definitely went up
8065954 the number of uninsured is considerably higher than when the president took office and in each year since then employer sponsored insurance has continued to diminish
8065955 i think its more like we are seeing a tide that i dont think anybody can easily fix particularly in the small business sector
8065956 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment
8065957 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it

8065977 we talked to the technicians and he explained what theyre going to be doing
8065978 it will illuminate what fountainbridges most famous former milkman thinks of many aspects of scottish culture and life including sport arhitecture and ofcourse the gothic tendency in scots literature
8065979 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8065980 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8065981 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8065982 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8065983 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8065984 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals
8065985 ongoing investigation and yesterdays action was just the first part
8065986 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs
8065987 it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8065988 but youre a developer surely youre not leaving that behind
8065989 investigations by unama united nations assistance mission in afghanistan found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men
8065990 we took no part in this hijacking at all it is completely against our aims values and objectives we condemn this hijacking with a strong voice
8065991 in kurdistan there is no freedom for journalists i have proof of that the most recent proof was soran
8065992 we dont know who killed him but we do know that the government didnt care
8065993 when they put the crown on my head i felt an adrenalin rush that i have never felt before in my life
8065994 with the exception of the nightly newshour it has become a generalised entertainment format to have showgirls to seduce the audience
8065995 the veline model would not be a problem if it was one of many models offered on television but we dont have television that seems to be capable of other options
8065996 at times there are terrible programmes in say britain or spain but at least viewers have a richer variety of shows to choose from
8065997 for men its a bit of a trap and for women they represent a model of success and fashion
8065998 television is a mirror of society and italian society tells women that you have to look sexy and young all the time
8065999 we cant get out of the stereotype of the superbabe or the foxy mama
8066000 it privileges easy success through shortcuts and without daily effort
8066001 whoever wants to become a television journalist is subjected to far worse humiliation than the girls competing to become veline
8066002 just like christopher columbus who didnt invent america but discovered it all ive done is make veline visible theyve always existed
8066003 i dont want to insult any of the nba teams i have a lot of teammates and friends who still play in the nba

8066008 discovery was wrong to continue to rotate the new promos long after the debacle besides perpetuating a lie it showed a lack of professionalism so to say they didnt do anything wrong is in itself wrong
8066009 last minute decisions happen and regardless of what you think about it they made a professional choice
8066010 the originally scheduled new episode of mythbusters has been rescheduled
8066011 in our zest to try to find ways to become energy independent were not always being particularly thoughtful the price of corn feed has gone up the price of chicken has gone up the price of eggs has gone up milk has gone up beef has gone up my view is that food should be put in your belly not in your gas tank we should try to solve our energy crisis in a way that we dont cause another problem
8066012 we need to break with that policy now and go down an alternative route one that doesnt cause another problem like raising food prices

8066363 you look like a groundhog cute and fuzzy you should have invented the pet rock
8066364 if theres one overriding reaction it was the less intensity he brings to a song the better it sounds even cutting him a break for this album being made up of well early works he indulges in some of the most overwrought heavily mannered pseudo soul singing ive heard since joe cockers heyday something that the tight format of idol probably didnt allow him to practice to excess the bulk of the album is made up of either dull by the numbers blue eyed soul including sadly two cuts later recut for his major label album the deal and soul thing they are not diamonds in the rough here or the aforementioned excursions into tortured oversinging a cover of ray charles version of georgia on my mind two highly cocker esque tracks called heart and soul and in your time yet on a few tracks he breaks the mold notably a pair of folky numbers the fall and west texas sky that i would recommend you check out especially the former skip however the ultra loose cover of archie bell amp the drells tighten up which the album booklet not only gives him credit for writing but which he seems to date unless i misheard him as coming from 1973 when it was a hit in 1968 so a disappointing collection from someone whos still one of my favorite idol contestants lets hope the new album displays a little more restraint and variety

8066382 if a man can write a better book or preach a better sermon or make a better mousetrap than his neighbor even if he builds his house in the woods the world will make a beaten path to his door

8066391 organiser une permanence dacc s aux soins de sant pass recommandations et indicateurs
8066392 it the early day motion is pretty well word for word the motion before the house today
8066393 as i visit london boroughs there is one thing that continues to stand out in every area whether hillingdon or harrow edmonton or enfield and that is the abuse of free travel by a minority of young people on our buses it is unacceptable that in some parts of london buses are intimidating places under a johnson mayoralty the passes will be taken away and only given back when community service has taken place i will end the something for nothing society culture for those who abuse it
8066394 free travel for children throughout london is not a right but a privilege i believe this scheme will help to curb the anti social behaviour that is blighting londons public transport system and demonstrate to the small minority of teenagers responsible that bad behaviour will not be tolerated
8066395 evidence shows that improving childrens literacy is an effective measure in cutting crime and anti social behaviour schemes such as this should be encouraged and nurtured as they achieve so much for some of the most vulnerable in london
8066396 many of those attending the butterfly school are being failed by labours education system it is a shame that children are reliant on schemes such as this in order to go some way to achieving their potential
8066397 this is a wonderful charity run by inspiring people who are involved in life changing work
8066398 children who cannot read are at a huge disadvantage the butterfly school improves their reading skills helps to raise their aspirations and to builds their confidence
8066399 i would love to see this expanded throughout westminster north
8066400 real action was founded eleven years ago and aims to provide a service for the community by the community our reputation has grown by word of mouth alone and our classes are always over subscribed
8066401 thousands of local children have benefitted from our butterfly school and yet we could have done so much more if we can secure funding we could sustain and develop our programme i am delighted that boris has pledged to support us if he is elected mayor of london on may 1st
8066402 it was a great privilege to welcome baroness warsi to westminster north
8066403 this constituency is home to an extremely diverse population with over 100 languages spoken in our schools
8066404 there are a number of organisations in westminster north that offer inclusive community led programmes and that provide positive opportunities for people of all ethnicities
8066405 programmes such as these transcend traditional cultural barriers and encourage genuine social interaction between different communities i look forward to working with baroness warsi in the coming months and years to ensure that they are given the support they deserve
8066406 in areas with high levels of ethnic diversity and high population turnovers such as westminster north cohesion within the community is vital because it helps to reduce crime and anti social behaviour and drives social mobility upwards
8066407 under this government there is a worrying trend that young people appear to be integrating less well than their parents and if this trend continues we could end up with a country more divided and segregated than ever before
8066408 it is encouraging to see social action projects in westminster north helping to develop greater levels of cultural understanding amongst local residents
8066409 the good work of these organisations must not go unrewarded i am responsible for ensuring that under the next conservative government funding is available to build upon the achievements of those in the voluntary sector and that every citizen has an equal opportunity to fulfil their potential
8066410 speaking to the harrow road traders it is clear that kens western extension of the congestion zone has driven business away from the area and is ripping the heart out of the local community small family run shops have been starved of trade because loyal customers are unwilling or unable to pay for the privilege of visiting their local retailers
8066411 the congestion charge must be reformed the western extension has dramatically increased the volume of traffic in the original central zone and we must get rid of it i pledge to introduce a fairer system that makes use of better technology and a system which doesnt penalise people who just nip in and out while some people pay the same for going in eight or nine times a day
8066412 ken livingstone has criticised the media for focusing on these events he is wrong
8066413 there have been two stabbings in this constituency and one young boy has lost his life during the last three weeks the more press coverage the better this issue has to be kept at the top of the political agenda
8066414 some children carry a knife as a status symbol to impress their friends others believe it provides them with protection very few intend to use it practically none of these teenagers will be aware that they are much more likely to be stabbed by their own knife than by someone elses
8066415 it is the job of the mayor to lead the fight back against violent crime every londoner has the right to walk our streets to use our public transport and to enjoy our green spaces in confidence and without fear of attack
8066416 electing boris johnson as the mayor of london on may 1st will be a massive step in the right direction
8066417 after 10 years in government and 8 years with ken livingstone as mayor with two weeks to go until londons elections labour have failed to address the serious issue of knife crime
8066418 gun and knife crime has been blighting londons streets and we need fresh ideas to rid our communities of these weapons
8066419 our current labour leaders seem to be in a state of despair and labours lack of action on this issue in london has led to families unnecessarily losing loved ones all londoners have the chance on may 1st to vote for a change to help make their streets safer
8066420 boris understands the gravity of the situation that we are facing in london and his policies reflect that a lot can be achieved by focusing on the smaller issues such as anti social behaviour on buses
8066421 our children have to be educated about their responsibilities they have to realise that their actions have consequences for both themselves and others
8066422 boris pledge to provide support for the voluntary sector is absolutely vital if we are to win this fight there are many organisations experienced in dealing with deprived families and youth gangs and we have to make sure that we put their expertise to good use
8066423 a tremendous number of local residents have been working extremely hard to ensure that this post office remains open the formosa street post office provides an invaluable service to the entire community and if it were to close many of our most vulnerable residents would be forced to use the st johns wood or queensway branches for the post office network to suggest that elderly people local businesses and those with disabilities should have to make such a journey on a regular basis is utterly unacceptable
8066424 we will put it the european constitution to the british people in a referendum and campaign whole heartedly for a yes vote to keep britain a leading nation in europe
8066425 those points the creation of a foreign minister and a european president are central to the european constitutional treaty and of course i see no prospect of their being brought into force save through the vehicle of a constitutional treaty
8066426 if it looks like the constitution if it sounds like the constitution thats because it is the constitution

8066446 the whole thing was blown out of proportion oprah has problem with some of my lyrics which is fine but when i came on her show as an actor with the crash cast i felt i treated unfairly i respect oprahs opinion but i would also like her to respect me
8066447 but i do believe there needs to be awareness of who we are how we got here and what that means about staying here
8066448 ive been involved in three projects pitched to her but ive never been asked to participate for barbershop she had cedric the entertainer and eve on but i wasnt invited maybe shes got a problem with hip hop
8066449 shes had damn rapists child molesters and lying authors on her show and if im not a rags to riches story for her who is
8066450 i knew early on that in american ballet theatre to play the swan you had to look a certain way to be giselle you had to look a certain way
8066451 i was like you know thats not going to happen even though i was at abts school i just knew the reality we would go see the company perform and i never saw any black people up there
8066452 the company manager told me stay here lock the door and dont come out while they went to perform
8066453 i did and from my window i saw a cross burning outside
8066454 i think we are going backward i was recently surprised when i attended a performance of balanchines theme and variations and saw four black men in the ballet but then i noticed there were no black women
8066455 there is always a shortage of boys in ballet schools but i find it interesting that there is always scholarship money for a talented black guy but not necessarily for a talented black girl
8066456 many artistic directors and choreographers want corps de ballet dancers to look the same in height weight and skin color especially in the classics
8066457 the corps is supposed to be a reflection of the ballerina particularly in such classics as swan lake and sleeping beauty and if a corps dancer is different it detracts from that unified look as a whole it also detracts from the ballerina all eyes should be on odette or aurora not one of the corps de ballet dancers
8066458 lauren has an extraordinary talent with so many possibilities and she can do anything as for being black in a so called white world if dancers are good and have what it takes you believe in them not their color
8066459 its very rare that you are going to go somewhere and youre going to see 30 white girls in a row looking the same to me when they say uniform that should be in the dancing and not so much the look
8066460 i wondered if the chunky girl with the bad feet could have gotten that job if she were black
8066461 i always get a kick out of going to these ballet companies and sort of being this modern dancer who comes in and is teaching these works tharp ballets and one girl will have a pointe shoe you know ill go over and say can i put that shoe on and its oh be careful and you know la la la and i just put the shoe on and go on pointe and everyone goes wow because there is this perception that black peoples feet dont point
8066462 the reason i joined the company frankfurt ballet was because i saw a variety of people kate strong was this huge fat woman who had been trained at the royal ballet school but just moved like the wind you know he william forsythe purposely chose people who were different and it looks so beautiful i was cast in lead roles all the time at one point it was literally half and half there were 10 to 12 black dancers
8066463 its like they just dont see you fitting into the flower festival town scene a scene from the fantasy ballet
8066464 i choreographed a beautiful ballet sequence for the wiz the film version with the women dancing on pointe it was so beautiful everyone loved it anyway it was cut from the movie i was so hurt diana ross was so mad sidney lumet the director said it just didnt fit into his overall vision of the film do you realize that that ballet sequence would have been the first time black women would have been seen dancing on pointe in a movie you know they have always had a problem accepting black girls dancing on pointe sidney lumet had no problem with us dancing as crows in the scarecrow scene i guess that is how they see us as crows
8066465 i did that part every time we did the nutcracker at lincoln center
8066466 basically i was taken out of the part because i was black
8066467 i made my decision to leave nycb because i didnt dream of being in the fifth line of the corps in back i wanted more so i joined dance theatre of harlem
8066468 its kind of funny tidewater ballet academy is located right across the street from a housing project and to my knowledge they have never had an outreach program to any of the kids in that housing development says melms
8066469 is the same for minorities as for non minorities the first one is money the second is influence
8066470 the fact that were here in 2007 and people are still interested in what its like to be a black ballerina says a lot
8066471 life may begin at 30 but it doesnt get real interesting until about 150
8066472 the law recognizes a difference between a true threat one that can be carried out and the reported racist rantings of a drug addict
8066473 a bunch of meth heads get together we dont know why they do what they do people do lots of stupid things on meth
8066474 if youre talking about a true threat there has to be some evidence theyre not just talking about it or thinking about it especially in a drug induced state
8066475 he dont belong in political office blacks dont belong in political office he ought to be shot
8066476 looking back at it i dont want to say yes but i dont want to say no
8066477 the capability and their opportunity and what they had for their weaponry i dont see that they would have been able to carry it out
8066478 a leading source of radical homosexual propaganda anti christian bigotry and radical transgender advocacy
8066479 i have been mocked over and over again by ungodly and unprincipled anti christian lesbians
8066480 six years in sodom from the journal of james hartline
8066481 theres a lot of tents around here and theyre all pretty big
8066482 how did you get this and how did you get here
8066483 is it ok if i call my boss and let him know where i am
8066484 its not that people dont want to use mac os x but theyre not open to spending an exorbitant amount of money for something thats essentially generic hardware
8066485 and some dish kind of needs something its almost always chipotle because it has such great flavor
8066486 i found a lovely similarity of flavors between the barbecue i grew up with and the dishes that were flavored with chipotle
8066487 we think that the crisis has forced our government to pay attention to local rice production which has been neglected for so long
8066488 i have never seen this kind of price hike in 30 years
8066489 just a few months ago 1 kilogram of paddy unhulled rice was selling here for 110 cfa francs 0 27 and now it is 225 cfa francs 0 56
8066490 africa faces not only problems of affordability of rice but also of availability in the international market because of the rice export bans by several countries
8066491 since 2006 warda has been systematically alerting the governments of its member states to a looming rice crisis in africa
8066492 we have to remember that there is a substantial part of the population that has not enjoyed the boom
8066493 people frequently say a rising tide lifts all boats we see here with these numbers that a substantial part of the population has been left off the boat and left frankly floundering in the water
8066494 how do we generate more revenue that can be dedicated to expanding access for health insurance
8066495 if we could finance what the legislature has approved we could go from fifth in the nation to last in the nation in terms of uninsured we just have to find the funding mechanism

8066499 we understand that our policyholders costs of protecting their aircraft have gone up therefore increasing this protective coverage was simply the right thing to do
8066500 to try to fly out in the midst of a huge storm isnt always the best idea

8066505 the main thing was that he just didnt draw the immediate ferocious opposition that hillary does although i personally like her very much but i just voted for who i thought could win is that a bad thing
8066506 i cant think of any capacity where the bush administration hasnt erred as far as foreign affairs and diplomacy is concerned
8066507 this idea that the neocons have that you go in and conquer the arab countries that have somehow offended you and all of the sudden the world is wonderful is just the most absurd thing ive ever heard really
8066508 it is very hard with the exception of germany and japan which is a completely different situation
8066509 i never heard of democracies being created at the barrel of the gun people have got to want democracy perhaps the germans and the japanese with their experiences with the harsh dictatorships they had perhaps they wanted something else but the arabs from my experience is that they dont my experience is that they prefer authoritarian governments
8066510 we have a history of doing miraculous things and then having a very short attention span and that is what happened with the post 9 11 invasion of afghanistan
8066511 it is a little bit of a stretch but it will also be interesting to see what happens in iraq in far as helping them rebuild their country which we have personally destroyed the russians destroyed afghanistan and we destroyed iraq i hope we at least try in iraq i hope we pull out in next year but i hope we at least try to do the proper reconstruction there to give them a better hope i think we need to have a certain military presence but we dont need 160 000 soldiers to do it i would like to see those resources put back into afghanistan where the real terrorists were and are and i think that if we had the type of military presence we had there before we took our eye off i think we would have had bin laden by now
8066512 pull in its horns a little bit in order to rebuild its influence

8066520 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8066521 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8066522 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8066523 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8066524 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8066525 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8066526 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8066527 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8066528 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8066529 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play
8066530 he was not a blackberry kind of guy said his younger brother joshua goldman a 32 year old hybrid city bus engineer from san diego
8066531 man of la mancha his family said they remembered him at the camping trip he organized for his four brothers strumming a mandolin and singing as they paddled three weeks before his death down the potomac river this was near where he had been born and raised in potomac md goldmans father was nuclear physicist for the u s government from him benjamin got his chin dimple and his probing disciplined intellect his mother was a lover of philosophy henry james and the grand ole opry from her her son inherited his passionate love of music goldman met his wife when they were teenagers at a jewish summer camp they fell in love as counselors after a year in israel on a kibbutz he learned hebrew and wrote a song for his new love called dance lonni dance
8066532 ben had a gift for seeing things the way few of us could said paul mcnab vice president of marketing and corporate marketing organization for cisco
8066533 every problem was an opportunity every roadblock a chance to shine every discouragement a possibility to improve
8066534 for the next 2 hours we went whooping and hollering through the corridors of the pentagon fast i mean fast said his brother michael an allergist from maryland

8066541 he gave lots of lessons and was always asking me to sit for him
8066542 i was a very grumpy 13 year old and i had all of these posters of movie stars on my walls on saturdays my best friend and i would go up on her roof and cut out pictures of our favorite stars from movie magazines and paste them into our scrapbooks we especially loved nelson eddy wed hold his photos up and tell him we were going to show him an australian sunset
8066543 i dont know how it came to me to try watercolor but when i did it was so much faster and easier than making all those little strokes from then on pen and ink were out
8066544 i love painting eyes they really are the windows to the soul
8066545 if i see a photograph of a face and it has good contrast ill do a painting its especially good if the person isnt showing any teeth i hate to paint teeth
8066546 in those days the stars were always being asked for autographs so it wasnt such a big deal
8066547 every time id paint a celebrity id send a duplicate of the painting so he or she could keep it making a copy was much quicker than painting the original
8066548 id like to kiss ya but i just washed my hair
8066549 her assistant was also named marie and she would call occasionally to chat she told me that alice received many paintings and drawings of herself but marees are the best i shouldnt say so but i liked hearing that
8066550 ive always been interested in indian history particularly the partitioning of india and pakistan
8066551 not sweepstakes anyone can send in his or her name address and phone number i liked the contests that required some skill
8066552 i won several trips to israel hawaii disneyland and so many tvs and transistor radios i cant even count
8066553 cal and i were always going out to dinner or to the symphony or someplace with my contest prizes
8066554 the mayor came up to me afterwards and said you ought to be in politics kid
8066555 here was this woman with these enormous well she had quite a figure
8066556 i didnt want him to be too disappointed when he got home
8066557 i could have used those a while back when i had a mastectomy but its been 4 1 2 years now and im still cancer free so im very thankful for that
8066558 love is the net where hearts are caught like fish
8066559 i wrote to him asking if he would sign a portrait of him that i had done
8066560 he wrote back saying he would have to see it first i wrote back to him saying if i were in your position id do the same and enclosed the painting with a self addressed stamped envelope sure enough he autographed it and sent it back
8066561 i wrote to sen obama asking for a picture he sent back a lovely photograph of his wife and him along with his autograph
8066562 this will be the first time ive actually been able to vote
8066563 im always writing to my representatives giving them my two cents they need to hear our voices
8066564 its become hard to send the paintings to the stars i dont blame them they never know whats inside an envelope if i send something out im afraid i wont get it back but im going to keep doing the portraits as long as i can if there ever came a time when i couldnt paint well life just wouldnt be worth living anymore
8066565 stone king place charity work at the centre of their practice and having concluded the apparently seamless integration of two highly renowned charity teams they deserve top marks for entrepreneurship and innovation
8066566 this is a great tribute by our peers to the quality of stone king and very much an award shared by everyone who works with all our charity clients
8066567 we were over 200 years old before we added a london office to our bath base and this award does show that we have now been recognised as national players in the charity sector
8066568 he was a pioneer said bruce davis executive director of arts council silicon valley
8066569 he was a great local hero to me said nancy wiener who served on arts committees with schiro through the years

8066571 anytime he picked up to call someone for a donation they never said no said marilyn dorsa who chaired the medici ball with mr
8066572 he was a san jose guy his daughter stephanie ronco said
8066573 i put that incident in the perspective of all the good he did for the community and i certainly come down on the side of the good said former san jose mayor susan hammer
8066574 he was just a dear man he was kind and thoughtful and really cared about his family and the san jose community
8066575 the music is what really kept him going that is really the legacy that allowed him to persevere from that circumstance
8066576 was the one here holding up the tent said artistic director kevin hauge
8066577 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8066578 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth

8066580 this man just took my chair knocked into me look at this
8066581 i am a clinton delegate and these obama delegates are mistreating us
8066582 alabama i guess i just have this feeling that there is lingering prejudices there but maybe thats totally unfair on my part
8066583 oh michigan definitely its a good thing they didnt seat us near them
8066584 barack obama and john mccain have never had executive decision making experience ever
8066585 were not electing a rock star its not a vote to see whos the most charismatic
8066586 barack obama and joe biden are committed to producing enough homegrown fuel to replace every drop of the oil we import from the middle east and venezuela in just 10 years an obama administration will invest 4 billion to keep america in the car making business and give you a tax cut so you can buy a fuel efficient car or truck
8066587 its time for a president who will bring our jobs back and bring our troops home for the change we need its time for barack obama
8066588 what we need is someone who can step right in and do something right away clinton has an amazing ability to adjust
8066589 she and i are very good friends and i think she will be the best president when i sign up to support a candidate its to the end
8066590 there is only one candidate who will make the change that we need to restore the promise of america he is a man of integrity he is a man of honesty he loves his country he is barack obama
8066591 barack obama and john mccain have never had executive decision making experience ever
8066592 were not electing a rock star its not a vote to see whos the most charismatic
8066593 barack obama and joe biden are committed to producing enough homegrown fuel to replace every drop of the oil we import from the middle east and venezuela in just 10 years an obama administration will invest 4 billion to keep america in the car making business and give you a tax cut so you can buy a fuel efficient car or truck

8066596 she and i are very good friends and i think she will be the best president when i sign up to support a candidate its to the end
8066597 we will have to react somehow to react of course in a military way
8066598 we didnt look too far into it but you could tell he was dead sgt nazario was returning his weapon to the ready
8066599 it was inspiring she shared her values her ethic of working hard and giving back to the community having those kinds of values embedded in the lives of the people who will live in the white house is key we are going to revive this country by building from the bottom up
8066600 the law recognizes a difference between a true threat one that can be carried out and the reported racist rantings of a drug addict
8066601 he dont belong in political office blacks dont belong in political office he ought to be shot
8066602 i think a lot of folks who know and love barack are afraid for him but happy that he is ready to take a calculated risk for all of us
8066603 we dont know if this a serious plot some methamphetamine induced racist babbling or what
8066604 we do know regrettably that the country is not without a racist streak some white supremacists are angry about the possibility of a candidate that does not meet their standards of racial purity
8066605 what we always worry about in this country is not the vast political conspiracy but the lone gunman the single damn fool the timothy mcveigh who can get a truckload of explosives and carry on his own fantasy war
8066606 we havent yet invented the x ray for a mans soul
8066607 i feel god is protecting him and our secret service is so good now that i have never been afraid of someone assassinating barack obama
8066608 looking back at it i dont want to say yes but i dont want to say no

8066612 the case reported refers to a patient who developed status epilepticus in the day of her third dose of hepatitis b vaccination and we review the literature on this subject a 12 year old girl without a relevant previous history taking no drugs developed a seizure attack followed by unconsciousness and eventually died after three days of her third dose of hepatitis b hb vaccination
8066613 autopsy study revealed cerebral edema with congestion and herniation and diffuse interstitial type pneumonitis there seem to be a straight forward time relationship between the third hb vaccine the event of convulsion and the sudden death of the patient
8066614 we suggest that in some cases vaccination may be the triggering factor for autoimmune and neurological disturbances in genetically predisposed individuals and physicians should be aware of this possible association
8066615 what you just heard was the birth of a conspiracy between two different men with a single desire to win
8066616 we only represent terry christensen we have our problems with mr pellicano

8066628 obama is saying what we want him to say that we should end this war and hes sticking to a timetable
8066629 once he becomes president how he works it out well deal with it at that time
8066630 instead of sitting the election out debating constantly whether obama is progressive enough we need to find a place where we can make a big difference
8066631 when hes elected he says the first day hes in office he will pull together the joint chiefs and start a plan to bring our troops home
8066632 as progressives we will hold his feet to the fire he has made us a promise

8066637 even as mrs clinton prepared for her moment in the spotlight on tuesday night with a speech expected to offer a strong embrace of the nominee the lingering rancor between the two sides appears to have intensified with the convention this week with grousing from some clinton fund raisers about the way they are being treated here by the obama campaign in terms of hotel rooms convention credentials and the like

8066643 when someones buying a lot for 1 2 million you cant really tell them they can only build an 800 square foot house on it
8066644 we tried not to limit sizes to what was existing and instead plan for the future
8066645 not greater than a volume equal to five times the lot area
8066646 it was a fabulous effort on behalf of the community
8066647 but i think weve been very clear that this isnt sustainable
8066648 we thought of every possible fundraising way to make money that we could
8066649 i will never stay to live in england thats for sure

8066651 in england they say that manchester is the city of rain its main attraction is considered to be the timetable at the railway station where trains leave for other less rainy cities
8066652 but its not only the weather im not happy about here they just dont have time to feel the joy of life throughout the week they all work so hard they only talk to people at lunch break then in the evening they come home and watch the telly so they can get up early for work the next day
8066653 in future i would like to test myself in another top league im thinking of spain at least there will be no reason to complain about the weather
8066654 oh if only wed remained true to hillary and not fallen for that snake obama
8066655 voor dit kan ek nie dink dat ek al in die kaap was nie
8066656 you too will come full circle you will go back to your roots to roost

8066658 no conozco ni personalmente ni de referencia a ninguna de las personas con las que se me involucra y me parece de muy mal gusto una serie de por decir lo menos mentiras e incoherencias que se dicen all solo con la maquiav lica idea de hacer da o y por que s lo porque maracay forever es un grupo ameno en paz y de gente correcta donde no se aceptan fotos y comentarios malsanos bueno si es por ello
8066659 solo para corregir cada una de las informaciones que ac aparecen sobre mi y mi familia son totalmente falsas ignoro y no se qui n es y no lo conozco a ese
8066660 the most substantive proof so far that obamas youthful arrogance is getting the better of him
8066661 only a lame brain politician could come up with that excuse wrote aps in hawaii over at the cnn site
8066662 so cnn reports at 12 42 am and it takes obama 2 18 hours to respond
8066663 we didnt want to send it out then for two reasons
8066664 one wed be waking people up and two when you wake people up theres a better chance theyll hit unsubscribe
8066665 this is a subject of great intellectual import do not ridicule us you communist hecklers
8066666 just days after the russian invasion of georgia senator obama had this to say about the crisis mr
8066667 quote weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point end of quote
8066668 i guess we are left to figure out the rest for ourselves mr
8066669 its unlikely he was alluding to afghanistan the nation we liberated after 9 11 and continue to help
8066670 if i catch senator obamas drift then our failure to lead by example was the liberation of iraq mr
8066671 and if he really thinks that by liberating iraq from a dangerous tyrant america somehow set a bad example that invited russia to invade a small peaceful and democratic nation then he should state it outright because that is a debate i welcome
8066672 in the end confusion about such questions only invites more trouble violence and aggression mr
8066673 to promote stability and peace america must stand firmly on the side of freedom and justice
8066674 afghanistan the nation we liberated after 9 11 and continue to help
8066675 we paid 585 000 it was the peak of the market but no one told us
8066676 we would probably have to spend the next 20 years trying to get right on the mortgage thats crazy
8066677 even if someone put 5 to 10 percent down but bought in the valley during 05 or 06 they are likely upside down now
8066678 i dont advise people to walk away but how do you convince someone to keep paying when they owe so much more than their home is worth they cant sell and their lender isnt going to forgive 100 000 in principal its not good
8066679 instead of calling it a foreclosure these couples are saying were giving it back to the bank and then moving a couple of blocks away and renting a home for half their mortgage payment
8066680 homes have gone from being a place to live to a disposable investment for some
8066681 it used to be that paying the mortgage was the top priority now its keeping the credit cards
8066682 people should hang in there as long as they can ask for help and try to work with their lender
8066683 foreclosures are dragging down our housing market and unnecessary foreclosures are selfish and unfair to the homeowners struggling to pay
8066684 ive enough problems with sales dont bother me with marketing
8066685 this means that the new wetflex press offers the same advantages of strength of construction for high speed precision impression setting for the highest possible grade quality and speeds and it accomplishes all this with fast and easy user friendly change overs the same as conventional flexpress models
8066686 the wetflex process has the potential to put flexo printing to an even wider acceptance however to tap the full potential of this new technology a high end flexo printing press is required this is why we decided in favor of fischer amp krecke
8066687 this type of industry support certainly bolsters our belief that the time for the us bx is now

8066697 well basically weve just put two plates on each tibia on each side screwed it in with locking screws and formed a bone extension to the tibia and attached a prosthetic foot to each extension
8066698 yes we have a carbon fiber that has been molded to a roundness of a supposed foot and it offers her enough durability and mobility so she can continue to act like any other dog does
8066699 do you think she recalls the cruelty she went through at the beginning
8066700 i really dont think she recalls it at all though her demeanor is so positive and joyful and upbeat i doubt if that is really an issue the point is that dogs are a great example of unconditional love and she has shown that on a regular basis
8066701 during ordinary day to day production operation of the erema automated screenchangers is completely
8066702 i have the right to refuse an illegal search and seizure just like any other american
8066703 i was visiting a gentleman that i have actually been counseling because hes got a drug problem
8066704 their response to that was to arrest him for obstruction of justice in order to justify an improper search
8066705 like all cac systems the sw2 is engineered for easy operation easy maintenance and easy installation it can be installed on a machine frame table top or floor mounted the belt drive is designed for reliable quiet operation

8066708 the equitable proceeding in which a bank or other secured creditor sells or repossesses a parcel of real property immovable property due to the owners failure to comply with an agreement between the lender and borrower called a mortgage or a deed of trust
8066709 how many negative listings would you have to see deleted from consumer credit reports before you would believe that bad credit can be deleted ten fifty a hundred one thousand
8066710 how about 50 000 deleted listings would that convince you
8066711 in these pages we have listed the permanent deletion of over 50 000 listings from our clients files in the last two years alone
8066712 theres one deleted bankruptcy and theres another and another and another should i go on
8066713 i have this one listing on my credit report that simply must belong to somebody else
8066714 based on the missouri democrat delegation being seated in the nose bleed section at the democrat national convention it does not appear as if anything has changed missouri is not a priority for democrats
8066715 obamas elitist attitude toward middle america and his disregard for missouri was reinforced when he decided to use a missouri family as a prop during his wifes convention speech only to forget where he was first he was in kansas city then st louis then back to kansas city obama continues to prove that he is nothing more than glitz and glamour basking in the light of his own celebrity and hoping that no one looks at the facts of his record
8066716 e a sua inten o de ser vice prefeito do rio foi outra inven o imagina se eu preciso ser candidato a vice de alguma coisa minha filha
8066717 est claramente demostrado que cuando se trata de apoyar a barack obama las celebridades que lo respaldan no entienden de l mites en cuanto a campa as difamatorias o ataques
8066718 i never thought of microsoft as being a super valuable business i worked on software because it was fun and people could not see just what it could do so i decided to work on that we never thought we would have a big business with all these employees enjoyment is much more about what you do every day if you are engaged and enjoy something you are more likely to do world class work than if you decide something has a good wage rate so you will go and be a dentist or whatever for an entrepreneur picking something about which you are passionate is by far the most important thing
8066719 he played at a high level its just that simple he played a high level and hes got a big motor
8066720 its not disrespect to them at all but were going to get ready to play our game and weve got to take care of us theyve won games with their defense the iowa game last year as an example a 28 19 victory on the road in iowa city and the year before that the virginia game 17 10 victory in charlottesville va so were very respectful of them but right now weve got to take care of our business
8066721 joe and i are on the same page and ive got a great coach down there in ted gilmore i dont bat an eye about that because of ted and because of joe
8066722 tem coisa mais mediocre do que atingir seu potencial ao 18 anos
8066723 that the two girls had tried to commit suicide just because somebody gave them counselling cannot be believed also this was no counselling if what the girl said was true
8066724 obviously she knew while shes the victim she clearly didnt stand in the way of the cover up
8066725 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
8066726 the question for her as well as for him is what is their foundation what gives them a platform to engage in public issues
8066727 their big challenge is convincing people that they will continue to be active in politics and theyre going to continue to have a voice
8066728 an imperfect man with a truly progressive vision who spoke to and for those whom others ignored yes that is who i supported
8066729 an imperfect man who had come to face his own imperfections and was seeking to redeem himself to those closest to him yes that is who i supported
8066730 she knew he was running for president with this bomb waiting to go off she did she kinda loses my sympathy
8066731 i believe we are all owed a huge apology not self serving claims for pity by both john and elizabeth edwards who both knew about the affair and both decided to go forward and seek the democratic candidacy regardless of the titanic risk
8066732 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
8066733 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
8066734 i thought it was very naive on both their parts
8066735 it would be very sad if he were the nominee of our party right now
8066736 and if i could choose a place to die it would be in your arms
8066737 and if i could choose a place to die it would be in a hospital or other institutional setting so that you will be spared the clean up
8066738 as i have loved you that you also love one another
8066739 the district court that heard the case of roe v
8066740 gun rights activists in recent decades have sometimes argued for a fundamental natural right to keep and bear arms that both predates the u s constitution and is covered by the constitutions ninth amendment according to this viewpoint the second amendment protects only a pre existing right to keep and bear arms in the related case of united states v lopez 514 u s 549 1995 the supreme court held that while congress has broad lawmaking authority under the commerce clause it is not unlimited and does not apply to something as far from commerce as carrying handguns
8066741 if the international community fails to take such a bold step it would lead the tamils to think that the ic is supporting the military agenda of the gosl at the cost of the lives of the innocent idps in vanni he told tamilnet
8066742 the international community and other interested nations if they want to usher in peace with justice in sri lanka they must first effect an immediate cease fire and address urgent humanitarian needs of the innocent civilians here
8066743 well you know i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
8066744 was just plain evasive obviously seeking to play down his extremist view that abortion at any time in any circumstance is perfectly acceptable to him
8066745 above my pay grade is the government military version of thats not my job im sorry my enlighten sic progressive friends but when you are getting ready to try to run the free world there is nothing above your pay grade if there is then you are not the leader so send us the person for whom answering tough questions is within their pay grade
8066746 we must unite as a nation to put a stop to abortion
8066747 under no circumstances are we going to execute or imprison women who have abortions or the doctors who perform them in the united states of america
8066748 a clear message that the jury wants these parties to fight in the marketplace and not in the courtroom
8066749 we are pleased that the jury agreed with mattel that what mga did was wrong and that damages were awarded
8066750 we can say this we are absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
8066751 obviously i think this is one of those things that travellers are going to expect and airlines will feel the need to provide
8066752 we have talked to both of the canadian carriers as well as carriers in mexico
8066753 all of them have shown a lot of interest were a little bit further along with some than others in getting to an agreement with them
8066754 we are actively engaged in discussions with in flight internet providers and are expecting to make further announcements later this autumn
8066755 its definitely something we have been looking at weve looked at a couple of different options
8066756 the airlines are looking for any sort of revenue they can get
8066757 it makes very good sense to have it on an airplane for a reasonable price
8066758 no one is the same you cant compare yourself to other people because everyone is different
8066759 and the fact that my familie have no fate in me
8066760 ya know when theyre sitting there with all the other steaks they dont look so big
8066761 the thing that i envy most about truman was that when he was in the white house he could go out and take a walk
8066762 he could put on that fedora and take a stroll without someone following him
8066763 the best thing about living down the street from obama is when i walk my dogs late at night
8066764 i always feel secure because i know someone is always watching
8066765 certainly these people despise black people in general and obama in particular

8066783 there will be criticism from some inside and outside the company that these changes particularly in editorial will compromise quality and critical mass in the metro mastheads and their mission we reject that
8066784 he was a man who loved his fellow man and he developed some very meaningful and positive relationships worldwide
8066785 the finalists move into her mansion live together and each week tila will narrow down her suitors
8066786 every episode will culminate in a dramatic ceremony unlike anything youve ever seen before
8066787 tila tequila made a name for herself by doing things her way captivating legions of fans online both men and women now she is taking that attitude and sex appeal to her own tv series where she is looking for a mate by again captivating a group of both men and women
8066788 the show is a rollercoaster ride of drama conflict and emotion busting stereotypes and challenging the norm proving that the rules of attraction are made to be broken
8066789 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment
8066790 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8066791 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8066792 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner
8066793 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8066794 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8066795 in this day and age where all these ballparks are being built now where people can reach out over the outfield fence and catch balls fan interference is becoming more and more of an issue
8066796 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8066797 it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times
8066798 thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8066799 i find it very strange that with 30 games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8066800 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time
8066801 some people thought that we ought to wait until the postseason
8066802 id rather go into the postseason knowing that weve already used it
8066803 so if the game is held up for a couple of minutes a couple of times a year i think thats ok
8066804 its certainly not going to be seen as often as it is in the nfl
8066805 i believe that because of the configuration of ballparks both new and old that calling home runs is really much more difficult than it once was
8066806 i dont believe in the use of instant replay for other things
8066807 i just dont want it to open up pandoras box with calls at home and calls at the bases and eventually behind the plate
8066808 i need my menopause stuff where are they how can they do this i really really need my menopause stuff
8066809 the county is the proud owner of a million dollar barn said eden prairie mayor phil young
8066810 i dont think the city of eden prairie has any interest in the barn i have no interest in the barn
8066811 if nobody wants to own it then what happens to it i dont know sagsveen said
8066812 preferred strategy is to preserve the barn in its present location and reuse it for a commercial storage facility after the pioneer trail reconstruction is completed said robert vogel an architectural historian who has advised the city on the fate of the barn
8066813 the word is going out that you can talk to the county if you are interested in leasing that space or moving the barn said betsy adams chair of eden prairies heritage preservation commission
8066814 there was never any expectation that the city council would say oh we would like to buy that but nobody the city the heritage preservation commission the historical society nobody wants that building to disappear adams said
8066815 i shall tell you we have killed him you and i we are his murderers but how have we done this how were we able to drink up the sea who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon what did we do when we unchained the earth from its sun whither is it moving now whither are we moving now away from all suns are we not perpetually falling backward side ward forward in all directions is there any up or down left are we not straying as through an infinite nothing do we not feel the breath of empty space has it not become colder is it not more and more night coming on all the time must not lanterns be lit in the morning do we not hear anything yet of the noise of the gravediggers who are burying god do we not smell anything yet of gods decomposition gods too decompose god is dead god remains dead and we have killed him how shall we murderers of all murderers console ourselves that which was the holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet possessed has bled to death under our knives who will wipe this blood off us with what water could we purify ourselves what festivals of atonement what sacred games shall we need to invent is not the greatness of this deed too great for us must we not ourselves become gods simply to be worthy of it there has never been a greater deed and whosoever shall be born after us for the sake of this deed he shall be part of a higher history than all history hitherto
8066816 my time has not come yet the tremendous event is still on its way still traveling it has not yet reached the ears of men lightning and thunder require time the light of the stars requires time deeds require time even after they are done before they can be seen and heard this deed is still more distant from them than the distant stars and yet they have done it themselves
8066817 what are these churches now if they are not the tombs and sepulchers of god
8066818 my ambition and pleasure is not to act but to understand
8066819 we are living now not in the delicious intoxication induced by the early success of science but in a rather grisly morning after when it has become apparent that what triumphant science has done hitherto is to improve the means for achieving unimportant or actually deteriorated ends
8066820 american double standard seems to be applied haphazardly since they invited the iranian national basketball team to participate in the july 2008 nba summer league rocky mountain cup and hold friendly matches with three nba teams now they say it is not possible for haddadi to play in the nba
8066821 he thinks hes as famous as jen now last week he went to a party tipped off the paps and even had decoy cars at the ready when he was leaving nice but no one bothered to follow them which made john think he lost everyone when really it was because no one bothered to follow him
8066822 pictures of john and jen were selling for 20 000 at one point a picture of him alone gets 200 now chasing him from his apartment to a restaurant is hardly worth it
8066823 jennifer didnt see herself and john having much in common or having a future together she wasnt fazed by the ending of it she wasnt hurt at all she feels fine
8066824 didnt want to waste anybodys time if somethings not right
8066825 had i seen a photograph of him that day i would have picked him
8066826 i was more mesmerised by the size of the guns
8066827 i had just arrived from brisbane and was in the car in norton street leichhardt my friend crossed the road to buy flowers i was the only person in the car
8066828 the car windows were up and i heard banging behind the car and i thought someone was hitting the back of the car for us to move
8066829 it was bang bang bang at least six times in the back of the car i turned to see what happened and three fellows were coming along the footpath
8066830 they stood beside the car window one was wearing a blue sleeveless type top and one was in a yellow t shirt the other fellow i could not see him
8066831 the one in the yellow shirt that was the gunman he was looking back at the other fellow and they were exchanging shots
8066832 there were two guns very large pistols charcoal grey i was mesmerised by them
8066833 i was sitting in this car and this commotion happened around me i thought it was someone making a movie then i saw these fellows swapping guns and then they walked down the street as if they were under the sun on the beach
8066834 it was impossible that the apostles could have persisted in affirming the truths they had narrated had not jesus christ actually risen from the dead
8066835 ye men of israel hear these words jesus of nazareth a man approved of god among you by miracles and wonders and signs ye have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain this jesus hath god raised up whereof we all are witnesses
8066836 and they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of jesus but peter and john answered and said unto them whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto god judge ye
8066837 for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard
8066838 and they departed rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name
8066839 the whole episode was planned by jesus and his followers that death w ould be feigned so that early removal from the cross might be secured
8066840 even as they delivered them unto us which from the beginning were eyewitnesses
8066841 that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled
8066842 for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty
8066843 you could imprison them flog them kill them but you could not make them deny their conviction that on the third day he rose again
8066844 it was impossible that the apostles could have persisted in affirming the truths they had narrated had not jesus christ actually risen from the dead
8066845 as for saul he made havock of the church entering into every house and haling men and women committed them to prison
8066846 and saul yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the lord
8066847 and as he journeyed he came near damascus and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven and he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto him saul saul why persecutest thou me and he said who art thou lord and the lord said i am jesus whom thou persecutest
8066848 observations on the history and evidences of the resurrection of jesus christ
8066849 i have been used for many years to study the histories of other times and to examine and weigh the evidence of those who have written about them and i know of no one fact in the history of mankind which is proved by better and fuller evidence of every sort than the great sign which god has given us that christ died and rose again from the dead
8066850 there exists such overwhelming evidence positive and negative factual and circumstantial that no intelligent jury in the world could fail to bring in a verdict that the resurrection story is true
8066851 and in hell he lift up his eyes being in torments
8066852 and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire
8066853 unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood

8066874 the american work force is baking a bigger economic pie but the slices havent grown at all
8066875 its clear that the long period of strong economic growth we were in had a positive impact for most americans
8066876 obviously today were dealing with higher energy prices and the downturn in housing but the economy is showing enough resilience to keep growing in spite of those challenges
8066877 too many of our neighbors are living in poverty too many cant find a job and too many are living without health insurance

8066932 prohibit discrimination in employment or in admission or access to its educational or extracurricular programs activities or facilities
8066933 to suggest that we should invite my oppressor to campus to recruit others to join their organization that oppresses me so that we can all have an interesting discussion is beyond offensive
8066934 furthermore students recruited now would sign in as an ensign or second lieutenant o 1 and would not be critical in any sort of policy advising unless he or she attained a
8066935 in fact as justice breyer argued in oral argument in the case the remedy to speech or ideas with which one disagrees is more speech not a restriction on speech bryers argument is consistent with our mission as a liberal arts college which is to encourage the engagement of different points of view not limit such discussion
8066936 dont ask dont tell is neither a fair nor smart policy gays and lesbians have proven to be exceptional members of other countries armed forces and the current loss of expertise as a result of dadt is unquestionably great and there is no logical reason to deny gay and lesbians americans the right to defend this country
8066937 i happen to agree with dean schizer i am a great proponent of free speech and intellectual freedom i also believe these rights come with responsibilities the dean put it well emphasizing intellectual honesty and academic standards as important considerations when weighing whether someone should have the right to exercise free speech
8066938 therefore my personal opinion is that he ahmadinejad should not be invited to speak
8066939 spewed such hate and an understanding of history that is seriously flawed
8066940 our mission as a liberal arts college which is to encourage the engagement of different points of view not to limit such discussion
8066941 80 who has read about this issue for a number of years i read this blog and replies with interest
8066942 personally i am not black or jewish but i would fight to make sure that racist or anti semitic thought didnt penetrate this campus
8066943 we dont need to sideline our policy in order to create educational opportunities a robust well enforced non discrimination policy can exist side by side with a free and vocal airing of diverse ideas
8066944 80 who has read about this issue for a number of years i read this blog and replies with interest
8066945 i always had trouble finding bras that were both comfortable and fashionable i wanted to feel pretty and supported i knew that i couldnt be the only woman to feel this way so i set out to find beautiful lingerie for women of all different shapes and sizes
8066946 customers would ask us time and again how do i know if this is the proper bra fit how can i measure my correct bra size what is the formula to finding a good bra fit whats the best bra for a full figure or large cup size why cant i find a comfortable bra that makes me feel beautiful too what comes after dd how do i determine the right band size or cup size what does it mean when the back of my bra rides up why does my underwire dig and pinch we knew then that education had to be a part of our mission
8066947 we built our store to house the best collections from all over the globe fine french lingerie from aubade chantelle huit and simone perele italian luxury from cosabella and levante a range of sizes from fantasie freya and goddess out of the u k the best in american ingenuity from spanx wacoal dkny ongossamer lemystere and several hot canadian brands like arianne treesha and imode by keenan enterprises

8066950 we really try to keep an eye out for hot new designs like mary green silk honeydew intimates and anything from our customer favorite hanky panky

8066952 a violent education corporal punishment of children in u s public schools
8066953 more than 200 000 u s public school students were punished by beatings during the 2006 2007 school year
8066954 the other kids were watching and laughing it made me want to fight them when you get a paddling and you see everyone laugh at you it make you mad and you want to do something about it
8066955 all corporal punishment whether or not it causes significant physical injury represents a violation of each students rights to physical integrity and human dignity it is degrading and humiliating damaging the students self esteem and making him or her feel helpless
8066956 in the 13 southern states where corporal punishment is most prevalent african american students are punished at 1 4 times the rate that would be expected given their numbers in the student population and african american girls are 2 1 times more likely to be paddled than might be expected

8066961 it used to be that your local police were your neighbors church members and friends
8066962 by defending myself against the jew i am fighting for the work of the lord
8066963 the holocaust marked the culmination of two hundred years of christian fulminating against the jews
8066964 had no time at all for catholic teaching regarding it as a religion fit only for slaves and detesting its ethics
8066965 lets be the only people who are immunized against this disease
8066966 through the peasantry we shall be able to destroy christianity
8066967 the nazis regarded the churches as the strongest and toughest reservoirs of ideological opposition to the principles they believed in

8066970 betty has been a listener to my program since its inception and we cant thank her enough for her support this was kind of the last straw for her what harry reid did here
8066971 the eugene b casey foundation believes freedom of speech is a basic right of every citizen of this country their purchase of the smear letter was to demonstrate their belief in this right and to support rush limbaugh his views and his continued education of us
8066972 harry reid in a speech on the senate floor at 12 noon today a little over an hour ago attempted to hone in on all this and take some credit for it claiming that he and i had buried the hatchet or implying that that had been the case and then kept using the pronoun
8066973 if you compare it to an abraham lincoln document there is obviously no comparison
8066974 this is strictly a promotional marketing ploy historically speaking is it a historical document i wouldnt categorize it as a historical document
8066975 if im going to die i might as well die someplace beautiful
8066976 are you seriously saying right here in public that i should convert
8066977 are you like the head of iran because youre saying we should wipe out israel
8066978 no youre obviously and intentionally taking the single dumbest interpretation of my argument albeit an interpretation suggested by your own pathological obsession with never saying anything even mildly controversial and making it even dumber
8066979 thanks but wed rather stick with a messiah whos powerful enough to get the whole peace on earth thing right the first time
8066980 see the right has anti semites so its ok when our to carry signs saying nazi kikes out of lebanon
8066981 sometimes if you do too much the pain reasserts itself but i should be up and flying the flag by september 15
8066982 i mean i suppose its a little slower than i thought and as the doctor said to me the other day it wasnt an operation it was an excavation
8066983 i cant i suppose expect to be up and doing marathons straight away and it is only five weeks since the operation
8066984 my understanding is he has got rid of all the cancers there is no evidence that it has jumped the fence
8066985 sometimes if you do too much the pain reasserts itself but i should be up and flying the flag by september 15
8066986 a rare glimpse into their unique worlds and all the pocket of beauty in their garbage filled streets
8066987 im not going to discuss what peter and i talk about apart from the economy and the obvious fact that treasurer mr wayne swan doesnt seem to have much idea of what hes doing with australias economy
8066988 i have a very high regard for peter im fortunate to be able to attend and address a dinner in his honour in melbourne on friday night this week and well have to just wait and see
8066989 in two years time you and i will be sitting here having an interview in a pre election environment
8066990 youll be in your position and ill be in mine
8066991 well who knows he may be announcing some new intergalactic agreement of some kind or other you never know whats going to come out
8066992 what i would like to see him do is focus on the real economic issues
8066993 hes got to tell the australian people why he wants to raise a raft of new inflationary taxes when the government already has a huge surplus when inflation is elevated and every one of these taxes will put upward pressure on inflation
8066994 the objective of good government is for government to raise no more money than it needs
8066995 i think its important from time to time that the prime minister take the opportunity at venues like the press club to outline and update our plans for the future
8066996 im not about to blow the lid on whats about to be said today but we have a clear agenda following on from the commitment we made at the last election
8066997 there were three former staff members who were listed on the search warrant that was served on me in early july and we facilitated the gathering of material for police
8066998 the college received some internet material which contained allegations that i think are linked to the ones that are currently taking place
8066999 those matters were referred to the police some years ago
8067000 those circumstances where people have betrayed trust it is a matter of grave concern and shame and it needs to be addressed comprehensively in order to protect children in the future
8067001 i can assure parents that this school is committed to the most thorough child protection measures that we have been implementing for some considerable period of time
8067002 we work closely with authorities in the area of child protection we are committed to protecting children wherever we can
8067003 weve had five people come forward that formed part of the initial investigation
8067004 and as a consequence to those five people coming forward weve identified another eight people so at this stage were speaking to 13 people
8067005 what we can say at this stage is that there is a number of lines of inquiry that have come from the initial inquiries
8067006 there are a number of inquiries continuing and there are some suspects involved
8067007 there were three former staff members who were listed on the search warrant that was served on me in early july and we facilitated the gathering of material for police
8067008 but president liebowitz who really cares we beat them all anyway
8067009 it seems to me that striving for the best of both worlds should guide our position on this issue that is providing the best competition for our student athletes while at the same time applying the necessary policies to ensure a healthy balance between our academic and athletic programs that would mean choosing to remain in d iii while retaining the most stringent guidelines to ensure the kind of overall education we seek for our students
8067010 mini d1 programs and nescac and other like minded schools just cant compete that may be the time to consider a move as for now peter mellens practical advice seems like the best i have heard keep striving for success with your common sense approach to sports
8067011 intercollegiate athletics and the american university a university presidents prospective
8067012 it seems to me that striving for the best of both worlds should guide our position on this issue that is providing the best competition for our student athletes while at the same time applying the necessary policies to ensure a healthy balance between our academic and athletic programs that would mean choosing to remain in d iii while retaining the most stringent guidelines to ensure the kind of overall education we seek for our students
8067013 mini d1 programs and nescac and other like minded schools just cant compete

8067017 i dont have anything to tell you about senator mccains vice presidential selection process
8067018 for poverty and median income this was the worst economic expansion on record this adds to evidence that the gains that started at the end of 2001 were concentrated among higher income americans
8067019 the fact that poverty was higher and median income for working age households lower in 2007 than in 2001 despite six years of economic growth is the latest evidence that the economic expansion was weak and quite uneven the income growth that occurred after 2001 appears to have had little effect on middle and lower income households of working age
8067020 i think you could argue that americans overall are better off because we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment and low inflation and a lot of good things have happened a lot of jobs have been created

8067031 clients and grocery shopping in switzerland james coming up to broome in remote and both of us trotting off to play golf as often as time would permit the three key components of a friendship are loyalty priority and integrity james offered these unequivocally unconditionally and unsolicitedly to his friends to james a friendship was not about transacting favours instead a friendship was about investing in goodwill he always shared what he had with no expectation of return the tributes we have heard today and will continue to hear in the future are eloquent evidence that james invested wisely and true to his generosity he has left his wealth of friendships for us to share we are all very sad at his passing and that sadness is very difficult to swallow and we are all very proud of his achievements and friendships with us i believe that this pride will make it a little easier to swallow the sadness you may have left your friends behind but your friends will not leave you behind godspeed and rest in peace james you clearly deserve it
8067032 i am impressed with the initiative of both carey and liz in seeking professional playing opportunities overseas

8067045 this is a tragic loss for these boise families and sizzler wants to help
8067046 the times when war led to peace are long gone
8067047 we are thrilled that this jury sent a strong message that they want these companies to compete in the marketplace and not the courtroom
8067048 mattel has pursued this case first and foremost as a matter of principle
8067049 we have an obligation to defend ourselves against competitors who choose to engage in fraudulent activities against us

8067052 their job is to get aboriginal australian children out of bed in the morning get breakfast into them and get them to school which might not otherwise happen
8067053 many of our programs are focused on helping aboriginal young people so its encouraging to see that the report showed sa has also reduced the rate of indigenous youths in detention
8067054 people will be able to get their teeth into some really healthy discussions about a whole range of issues from planning to relationships all sorts of stuff that drives what we do
8067055 one of the big issues for us is to make this document a kick off for a process where the community gets together to decide what we want darwin to look like in a whole range of ways
8067056 there is certainly the numbers in the house now to bring a lot more government process and governance in general and i am absolutely confident that the council will have a very positive working relationship with both parts of the house
8067057 i have clearly stated my belief that gays and lesbians are our brothers and sisters and should be provided the respect dignity and rights of all other citizens i have consistently spoken directly to african american religious leaders about the need to overcome the homophobia that persists in some parts of our community so that we can confront issues like hiv aids and broaden the reach of equal rights in this country i strongly believe that african americans and the lgbt community must stand together in the fight for equal rights and so i strongly disagree with reverend mcclurkins views and will continue to fight for these rights as president of the united states to ensure that america is a country that spreads tolerance instead of division

8067069 you know this is a dream come true i never thought this would happen
8067070 we looked and looked and looked for a site and couldnt find any
8067071 it means security it means family traditions it means grandkids for generations to come ill never forget this this is a dream come true
8067072 to have our foundations focus here in el cajon to see this home come together and the other three that will be up here before too long its awfully special
8067073 it was tough to look into his eyes and say yes i can provide for your daughter when im living in their house and all i can say is that im a good teacher they just dont know it
8067074 after 2007 we anticipate that because of the loss of employment and the increasing cost of living that the situation of san diegans will worsen
8067075 just for a single individual to live in san diego and just for health care child care and the rising cost of living takes 28 500 dollars just to survive in san diego
8067076 now we know what russians really wanted now it is clear that it is not about abkhazia and south ossetia it is about georgia and russia know we know it is about russian imperialism now we know that it is about russias ambitions so i think that it is high time for the west to understand that this is not about only georgias job but it is largely should be the concern of the west because it is a war of values
8067077 we need help from the whole world president medvedev must not decide about independence of ossetia and abkhazia
8067078 the only place these people want to be is home and they cannot go home because of what has happened to them and because the situation that the russians have caused our goal as humanitarians is to do the best we can to give them a solid life with food clothing and self esteem until we can get them back into their homes
8067079 in showing intellect savvy and showing that a woman can run for president and that the american people are ready for a woman president
8067080 to capture this moment to get more women who became interested and keep them interested
8067081 weve passed that stage of being a novelty and its significant that she came so close and had so many people support her
8067082 she has to be very careful to strike the right tone and balance and not go too far over the line of saying im just like you because she isnt like most working mothers shes lucky
8067083 she has to find the right balance as someone relatively well off trying to say i understand to someone who doesnt have the resources
8067084 we dont have enough women in our public office and in our legislature in terms of breakthrough i tend to think its more of a media thing every few years its a great headline
8067085 of course its a breakthrough year and i think well have more but the goalposts keep moving
8067086 its not that there is ever a day in which we say were done
8067087 were done when women are consistently 50 per cent of all elective roles there will always a next step of how we want to break women more into us politics
8067088 we must maintain awareness and defeat anything that could hold us back
8067089 my goal is to provide an alternative not to free the mac os
8067090 what we want to do is to provide an alternative an

8067121 we dont want the samak government because hes very corrupted and hes a nominee from the thaksin governments and thaksin is not really gone
8067122 he exploited thailand and took everything and hes got lots of money so he can pull the strings thaksin is behind everything and samak is a nominee he does everything for thaksin
8067123 we all believe that thaksin try to use all the money because the government here is subsidised from thaksin anyway
8067124 they try to use all the money and then we dont have any money then thaksin will try to come back
8067125 its the place to do something fun and a little out of the box
8067126 its the biggest crowd and its what people are talking about i was fortunate to play and win in the audrey hepburn dress
8067127 this is the first time in 13 years that ive heard my voice echo here like this
8067128 everyones wondering what south florida is going to do this year because here this team got up to no 2 lost some games and then they won a bunch of games and then they got beat bad in a bowl game
8067129 so what kind of team is this going to be this year are they going to be like that team the first six games or are they going to be like that team that finished in the bowl game well see
8067130 i know us on the offensive side of the ball are just ready to go we just want to get out there and learn from the ups and downs from last year and just go out and put ourselves in a position to win the big east
8067131 we were not aware that jones was in the bay area
8067132 its the place to do something fun and a little out of the box
8067133 its the biggest crowd and its what people are talking about i was fortunate to play and win in the audrey hepburn dress
8067134 at the end of the fourth set i was having some problems fighting with the linesman and the chair umpire because they were wrong of course
8067135 its a big one last three or four tournaments ive gone out pretty early with tough players so its nice especially at the grand slam in your own country to get off to a good start
8067136 danny is a very strong player well suited for the russian leagues style
8067137 you will see him against manchester i believe he will seriously strengthen us
8067138 our domestic calendar was really busy but we have had time to prepare for the match in monaco
8067139 arshavins transfer story is taking too long it has already lasted six weeks and i wont deny it has had a negative impact on our team and our results as well
8067140 this is really good news for me and my team i hope we will all be able to play in good style against manchester and achieve positive result
8067141 now what do you do throw out a red handkerchief whats the format what do you do id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie
8067142 imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8067143 nobodys told us anything i think we should be schooled on it somehow
8067144 this is not going to work come on i shouldnt say it nots going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8067145 weve got a good five weeks here for me to rehab and get a good sense of how im recovering and what it looks like
8067146 then i think we will all have a better idea
8067147 my focus right now is trying to get a little better range of motion each day from now until the end of the season and then start worrying about all that other stuff
8067148 he just needs to get back to his family and hell come back when he can
8067149 he communicated to us he wanted to go to russia for personal reasons so we put him on waivers for him to do that
8067150 we put him on waivers so everyone would have a shot at him but im sure everyone knew what his situation was
8067151 i think that it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8067152 its a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time and theyve done a very good job with difficult situations in all aspects
8067153 so they made the call wrong once in a while weve all done things wrong once in a while
8067154 the thing that we care about right now is getting our team better if you watched our first three preseason games theres a lot of work we have to do
8067155 whether its your second year in the league or 12th year in the league its a pretty somber day
8067156 just in the sense of guys that are potentially losing their jobs typically its kind of weird
8067157 i dont think that the players at the same position are necessarily in competition with each other
8067158 we want to keep the best players and that may be a balanced roster or not it may include a few more players at one position and a few less at another
8067159 i know the backfield is crowded but ive also said i know what im capable of doing
8067160 unfortunately i had this setback with the injury this past couple of weeks but once they make their decision what theyre going to do if im here its just up to me to make sure that come sunday im at my best
8067161 i guess especially in preseason we actually get more reps or more carries than we do in the actual game i think it puts the onus a little more individually to go out and execute with the limited amount of actual game reps
8067162 we probably have one of the deepest backfields in the league
8067163 the thing about us is that we all bring something different to the table which gives the defense a different look
8067164 if you are running a race with a guy and he is a lap ahead of you and you have a strong finish you are still going to finish behind him
8067165 if you are neck and neck with the guy and you have a strong finish then you beat him and it makes a lot of difference
8067166 i think we worry about going out there and getting better every single day we cant take any backward steps
8067167 lets focus on illinois and getting better every day thats pretty much all we talk about
8067168 it was the first start for a lot of guys last year the atmosphere and the whole st louis thing
8067169 guys were just a little nervous and thats how it happened
8067170 well come out there this year and try to finish the game
8067171 hes been labeled as an option quarterback but now hes a passer
8067172 to spend all offseason youre just so thrilled to go out there and show the world what you can do
8067173 weve had a terrific run with the kids that have been in the program that have won national championships but theyve all left us
8067174 to see the change in leadership and the emergence of the leadership we sense a whole new excitement
8067175 i feel good about it if it were up to me im in
8067176 im sure everybodys confident on the defensive side that were going to be somebody
8067177 we like to have some challenging games on an on going basis
8067178 its good for our team it brings out the best in your team competition is not about always scheduling to win competition is about stepping out there and putting yourself out there a little bit and seeing what you can do with it
8067179 i mean im healthy i could play its just not in the cards this week i think mainly because we played saturday and turn around and play again on thursday
8067180 i just want to be 100 percent and healthy and feeling great going into the baltimore game
8067181 im just waiting on the call looking at the clock thats all so you know it is what it is nothings surprising
8067182 its always something every year theyve been trying to get me out of here for a long time now so its not surprising at all
8067183 i think if she will do everything opposite of what ive been doing throughout the years she will be no
8067184 this would be the most amazing thing that can happen
8067185 i would behave like a baby and the crying and all this
8067186 he hated it he was always like come on you have to grow up in your mind you cannot behave like this
8067187 when he plays his best i would take everything that he has his power fighting spirit
8067188 i think shes totally ready to win the first grand slam
8067189 theres always that frustration of not winning the championship youll have to carry that label
8067190 i think everybodys saying oh they dont deserve to be in the top 10
8067191 i think when we hold up that acc trophy well be fine
8067192 julios going to make some big plays this year he can go up and get it he can run by guys
8067193 he was like a prince in milan and at chelsea our philosophy was different we had no princes everybody needs to work like everybody else and everybody needs to prove he deserves to play
8067194 i think maybe he lost some self confidence step by step a player goes in the wrong direction
8067195 he was not my first option but the club gave him to me as a second option
8067196 i believe in the future he will again be a player of high quality the truth is i never had a single personal problem with him and i wish him well for the future
8067197 im feeling confident and i feel like im just really really really enjoying myself
8067198 ive been feeling good about my serve for a long time now its definitely one of my strongest shots and today it was there again
8067199 i was doing a lot of the things well to the olympics and i was really confident coming in here
8067200 i always come to a tournament trying to do my best and i never look at anyone else as like theyre favourites to win
8067201 one year i really ran into a lot of bad luck where i got the worst calls possible i couldnt even hit a shot because i was so nervous they would call every ball out
8067202 that really wasnt my fault i probably would have won that year and i was gonna win that year unfortunately it didnt work out
8067203 i didnt even remember holding up the trophy in 2002 i didnt even know i won this tournament thats how long its been
8067204 you dont have to show up and throw a fit anymore the proposal has been fixed
8067205 it bordered on comical to watch each group accuse the other of back room deals meant to subvert the process and steal funding for pet projects while of course they themselves were busy trying to make back room deals to get funding for their pet projects

8067224 i was only skin deep sex meant nothing to me anymore
8067225 i was so given into that lifestyle at that point i dont know i wasnt looking at the consequences i wasnt able to and thats a really dangerous place it snowballed for me really easily
8067226 i walked into a lifestyle where the more i did it the less i cared about myself and the more i wanted to beat myself up and give more of myself away
8067227 god has forgiven me but sometimes i think back to the situations i put myself in and because i have those memories because they are a part of me it forever changed my life forever affected me when im ninety i will still have those memories people dont realize that they dont realize how permanent those kinds of decisions are you cant get that innocence back
8067228 there are girls out there who have been used and have let themselves be treated that way and now they feel like trash they need to know theres hope healing forgiveness life after the state theyve been in newness

8067268 not to mention it being a great achievement for the underground operation
8067269 it will help us purchase items which we would usually have to go without resource material that needs to be upgraded which we didnt have the funds to purchase
8067270 almost everyone is getting a piece of the donation well stretch it as far as we can
8067271 i met people from all over the world and made friends for life its been an amazing experience
8067272 there were people from everywhere and we all came together to play at the olympics it was incredible
8067273 they have cut through the wire fence surrounding the buildings and have tried to gain access into the building and after that didnt work they damaged the satellite by throwing rocks at it
8067274 without the support and generosity of the rotary club people would not be able to have their treatment done in mudgee
8067275 the arrival of the vital signs monitor is like a christmas present come early we cant thank rotary enough
8067276 we have the funds to help train a nurse all we need is someone to be willing to undergo the training
8067277 market demand for development of this nature in the northern end of mudgee although council has indicated it would prefer its large lot residential subdivision in other parts of mudgee i believe that rejecting this area for development now without further investigation and public discussion is not doing the regions development justice
8067278 council is meeting to give consideration to a draft strategy which will then be forwarded to the planning department seeking approval
8067279 its one step in various stages of the process before it goes on public display and we start community consultation
8067280 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8067281 we have the man we need at last to embrace the future not the past and to dispel eight years of pain and shame is his name call the roll
8067282 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8067283 but hes not ready to lead the united states of america
8067284 im here to make a few points for the good side
8067285 i ask all of you who worked so hard for me who knocked on doors and made those phone calls who got in arguments from time to time to work as hard for barack obama as you did for me
8067286 lets work our hearts out to elect barack obama and joe biden our next president and vice president
8067287 she will thank her supporters and lay out the case for why they need to support barack obama
8067288 when she heard what sounded like someone moving quietly around the house
8067289 i came and was voted on as a delegate by the people who supported clinton and i have that obligation to do that we know she doesnt have the votes to win but we ran on our word that we were supporting hillary clinton shes not going to be president but shes going to be real important for this country and she needs to know that the people out there really appreciate what she did
8067290 shes going to be supporting senator obama all the way and will be asking for our support as well
8067291 for those who still choose to support and actually vote for hillary ive talked with a lot of them they have their own reasons i personally find them politically to be looking to the past as opposed to looking to the future
8067292 at the same time the future is friday going forward so im not going to get hung up on that
8067293 i am a clinton delegate and will be voting for clinton when we do the roll call vote but when i leave here i will be supporting the nominee barack obama as hard as i can
8067294 obviously were getting lost in the hype and the hoopla in the convention talking about issues at home finally but we need to readdress the war
8067295 barack obama will be a commander in chief who understands that young americans in uniform must never be committed to a mistake but always to a mission worthy of their bravery
8067296 the average american doesnt have ownership in the war in iraq the policy has been to go shopping health care the economy was well down on the list now the economy is number one
8067297 people are worried about the alligator closest to the canoe and the alligator closest to the canoe to most americans is the economy
8067298 when you talk about mccain you talk about a veteran
8067299 my dads not an idiot hes nothing short of a genius in my opinion
8067300 ste es un c ncer que se ha venido incubando durante a os y al que no se le dio la debida atenci n pero es un c ncer que vamos a erradicar
8067301 estamos completamente decididos a recuperar la seguridad la autoridad y el orden en las calles y en las plazas del pa s
8067302 apostando por limpiar depurar y profesionalizar los cuerpos polic acos porque no hay nada que agravie m s a los ciudadanos que la corrupci n y particularmente cuando la corrupci n est en la polic a
8067303 la sociedad ha visto por desgracia y con indignaci n que en algunos delitos por ejemplo en el caso de secuestros han sido los propios polic as quienes delinquen e incluso llegan a asesinar a sus v ctimas
8067304 para saber si hay elementos de un probable enriquecimiento debido a la corrupci n
8067305 we are always concerned about any provision that comes out as inadequate that extra 3 does concern us
8067306 but the encouraging thing is that when we do go back and reinspect 95 of those provisions inspected for the second time will come out as satisfactory or better
8067307 in the 30 most deprived areas 53 of childminders provide good or better childcare compared with 60 in the rest of the country
8067308 for the first time in the report we have looked in some detail at different local authorities
8067309 we are concerned that theres a variation and it doesnt seem fair that children in deprived areas seem to get a worse deal than those in more affluent areas
8067310 i am a childminder who has been doing the job for three years and i am thinking of giving up the paperwork side of it is ridiculous
8067311 we now have to do risk assessments observations planning and we have to now be registered as a food premises because we give snacks or a meal
8067312 im a childminder and have spoken to the parents about the eyfs and they agree with me
8067313 north korean authorities restarted the construction of ryugyong hotel in april
8067314 if completed the hotel will be used as an accommodation for foreign investors and visitors a business center and an international convention center among others
8067315 everyone has internal damnation waiting to rear and wreak its vindictive and sadistic means
8067316 everyone has internal damnation waiting to rear and wreak its vindictive and sadistic means
8067317 it seems to be a little more of a problem than i anticipated
8067318 all you need is 200 people in that crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
8067319 we need in the white house starting on january 20th barack obama and joe biden
8067320 still doesnt believe that women deserve equal pay for equal work
8067321 he doesnt believe that women deserve the right to choose
8067322 he would turn the clock back when what we need from our president is forward movement more progress the kind of opportunities that we expect for the next generation of americans
8067323 what obama has to have hillary do is stand up and say not only in words but its got to be almost method acting and say it in a way thats believable that she wants barack obama to be president
8067324 frankly goes toward any future political considerations she may have
8067325 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8067326 we have the man we need at last to embrace the future not the past and to dispel eight years of pain and shame barack obama is his name call the roll
8067327 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8067328 tell them to look up tell them to remember the stars
8067329 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
8067330 it would be a prohibition of first amendment discussion of issues
8067331 wouldnt you first try to ban lawyers from contributing to judges campaigns
8067332 nearly every lawyer who practices before the supreme court donates to judges
8067333 this case did seem to go on for quite a while
8067334 we can focus on our responsibility for those in our care and those we employ
8067335 if theres a conflict or a perceived conflict we cant represent them
8067336 im a good person and this has affected my life drastically
8067337 me tiene que matar pa quitarme la candidatura me tiene que matar
8067338 y para no permitirme jurar una vez salga electo porque voy a salir electo me tiene que matar
8067339 si aqu hubiera una grabaci n o un v deo hace rato que aqu hubieran mandado a arrestar a este servidor
8067340 eso lo hace una persona ingrata y una persona que es capaz de venderle el alma al diablo por protegerse a s misma
8067341 no quer a que me le acercara y evit retratarse conmigo
8067342 no en cuanto a la pol tica se refiere no lo es en cuanto a que se utilicen asuntos para coartar mi libertad en unas acusaciones falsas infundadas y maliciosas s pero que sea algo que no sea parte de las luchas controversiales que he vivido en las ltimas dos d cadas no lo es
8067343 que las posturas de ellos se parecen m s a las de pedro rossell es otro liderato y no se han dado cuenta de que lo mismo que est n diciendo es lo mismo que dec a pedro en contra de nosotros cuando pedro dec a que por el bien del partido hab a que entregar la presidencia del senado y ahora luis dice que por el bien del partido tengo que renunciar a la candidatura
8067344 hubo rumores de que se hizo un esquema de los amigos de luis para darle contratos a su esposa para que l pudiera vivir en washington yo recuerdo que s que l habl de eso en un grupo que yo estaba que una de sus condiciones para ser candidato a washington era que el dinero de congresista que l ten a no le daba para vivir se busc a personas que le pudieran alquilar la casa y se le alquil la casa se busc a personas que pudieran darle contratos en washington a vela y eso puede interpretarse como venta de influencias
8067345 le tengo que decir que no se convierta en un lacayo de los comunicados que le prepara el comit de campa a de luis fortu o que me respete un poquito m s y si l supiera que yo lo que estoy haciendo es una comparaci n con los rumores que ha habido de luis fortu o y su esposa estoy hablando de los rumores que ha habido en torno a mi persona que es lo que se est verificando
8067346 que se lea el caso de los aut nticos que dice que los reglamentos no est n por encima de las leyes de puerto rico
8067347 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed
8067348 dr dre is mourning the loss of his son andre young jr
8067349 the big plus is that you can now shoot video with a great lens
8067350 the one thing thats really been missing from the slr market has been the ability to record high quality video
8067351 what is the current clinton plan to regain the white house for the family i mean if barack obama wins this general election he will no doubt be renominated by the democratic party in four years how can the clintons get back the white house if barack does win
8067352 oh chris how can you ask that question for gods sake
8067353 so theres no more plan for a clinton restoration of a clinton presidency im serious why are you laughing
8067354 the county is the proud owner of a million dollar barn said eden prairie mayor phil young
8067355 i dont think the city of eden prairie has any interest in the barn i have no interest in the barn
8067356 if nobody wants to own it then what happens to it i dont know sagsveen said
8067357 preferred strategy is to preserve the barn in its present location and reuse it for a commercial storage facility after the pioneer trail reconstruction is completed said robert vogel an architectural historian who has advised the city on the fate of the barn
8067358 the word is going out that you can talk to the county if you are interested in leasing that space or moving the barn said betsy adams chair of eden prairies heritage preservation commission
8067359 there was never any expectation that the city council would say oh we would like to buy that but nobody the city the heritage preservation commission the historical society nobody wants that building to disappear adams said
8067360 our country deserves the liberal immigration policies of mccain not the liberal immigration policies of obama
8067361 the nine scariest words in the english language are im from the government and im here to help
8067362 our country deserves the liberal immigration policies of mccain not the liberal immigration policies of obama
8067363 theres always a silver lining these results could open the eyes of many people as to what is happening with sports in our country
8067364 there were obvious problems with training in some disciplines athletes who did not reach their full potential and others who showed a lack of psychological preparation at key moments
8067365 every discipline and all human and material resources that we dedicate to sports
8067366 shamelessly stole the fights from two cuban boxers in the semifinals
8067367 it was a crime what they did with the young men from our boxing team to complement the work of those who go about stealing athletes from the third world
8067368 we have to improve the quality of our national series review our selection and training methods align ourselves with those who are doing better and reduce the pressure that we all put on our players and coaches who are questioned at every turn every decision
8067369 the sport has been mixed up in politics and that has put even more pressure on the athletes especially our baseball players
8067370 the glory of our country cannot depend on batting at just the right time or making a winning shot as if each competition was a battle field
8067371 people were not in the restaurants in the volume we were anticipating
8067372 for a large part of that period gas prices were extraordinarily high
8067373 it was a challenging consumer environment and its possible that consumers at the tail end of the quarter were watching phelps instead of going out
8067374 i have no problem paying the bills but the market seems to go down endlessly
8067375 sometimes i wish i had looked for a job rather than just retiring
8067376 they cant give gifts to grandchildren they cant jump on a plane and visit their children like they used to
8067377 you better hope your spouse has coverage or you work for an employer for enough hours that you can get some coverage
8067378 its a lot and it goes up all the time
8067379 the less you withdraw from your investments at times like these the better
8067380 i see people in their 50s and 60s going back to work just because of the downturn
8067381 this is the best plan to meet consumer demand and utilize our assets at michigan truck and other facilities both in the near term and long term
8067382 is a big incentive to buy now vs later when you most likely wont have that option
8067383 it makes a lot of sense for builders to do a lot of promotions on that
8067384 were trying to let everyone know hey this is going away
8067385 i was unhappy and upset that she lost but im going to be voting for obama in november
8067386 hes a brilliant leader and we have to have unity in the party to win the election
8067387 im disappointed hurt and angry about hillary but im not deluded
8067388 four more years of a bush presidency under mccain would be a disaster for our country
8067389 scheduling is very difficult two of them happened to be in venice at the same time because of the burn after reading premiere so there was a brainstorming session
8067390 we sent out a press release one day saying we were on the verge of closing it down and the next day we had 500 000
8067391 they shine the light on the real emergencies and step up where we really need help
8067392 we reiterate our request that the department of justice fulfill its commitment to take prompt action to investigate and to prosecute the american issues project and we further request that the department of justice investigate and prosecute howard sic simmons for a knowing and willful violation of the individual aggregate contribution limits
8067393 having failed in its attempts to get our legal factual and fully supported ad off the air barack obamas campaign now wants to put our donors in prison for exercising their right to free speech
8067394 these over the top bullying tactics are reminiscent of the kind of censorship one would see in a stalinist dictatorship with the only difference being that those guys generally had to wait until they were in power to throw people who disagreed with them into jail
8067395 there appear to be more than 50 000 documents 128 boxes and 946 files
8067396 she doesnt believe her sister intentionally did anything to her child
8067397 she is not physically capable of having committed those acts
8067398 this whole ordeal has taken a very negative effect on her emotionally and physically
8067399 she wants this to be over she wants to be vindicated
8067400 havent even thought about dinner so why dont we go out
8067401 scheduling is very difficult two of them happened to be in venice at the same time because of the burn after reading premiere so there was a brainstorming session
8067402 we sent out a press release one day saying we were on the verge of closing it down and the next day we had 500 000
8067403 they shine the light on the real emergencies and step up where we really need help
8067404 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8067405 we have the man we need at last to embrace the future not the past and to dispel eight years of pain and shame barack obama is his name call the roll
8067406 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8067407 best able to meet americas challenges and seize americas opportunities
8067408 realistic and resulting wisdom whichis sorely needed in america today
8067409 theres no place like a home or a home or a home or a home
8067410 i go to god and ask god to help me and he do make me strong and i pray to him that no other hurricane come back like katrina
8067411 all the things id like to do with my life
8067412 and the heavens opened and saved me from then on they have been my biggest influence
8067413 did this purchase of garmin mobile pc include a garmin gps receiver
8067414 one continuous fight the retreat from gettysburg and the pursuit of lees army of northern virginia july 4 14 1863
8067415 my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
8067416 driven by the same conviction that drove my dad to get up an hour early each day to painstakingly dress himself for work the same conviction that drives the men and women ive met all across this country thats why i love this country
8067417 were still living in a time and in a nation where the bar is set right you start working hard and sacrificing and you think youre getting close to that bar youre working and youre struggling and then what happens they raise the bar keep it just out of reach
8067418 for the first time in my adult life i am proud of my country because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback
8067419 we know there are people out there with vital information which can assist us in identifying the six youths who came to the tower block that day
8067420 it may be they havent contacted us because they dont want to get involved or think other people are bound to come forward
8067421 no hemos tomado parte va en contra de nuestros objetivos y principios condenamos con dureza este secuestro
8067422 vamos a volver a escuchar ese apoyo de nuevo alto claro y desde el coraz n
8067423 si hubiese unas olimpiadas de enga ar de dirigir mal y de malversar esta administraci n se llevar a el oro no nos podemos permitir otra administraci n republicana
8067424 arriba obama biden despierta am rica despierta am rica despierta am rica
8067425 habr algunos seguidores de la senadora clinton con quienes habr que trabajar duro para convencerles de sumarse eso no es ninguna sorpresa
8067426 pero si echas una mirada esta semana estoy absolutamente convencido de que tanto hillary como bill clinton entienden que es lo que est en juego
8067427 i didnt take him serious for a minute i mean its coop
8067428 he said it with a sly smile of his face so i played it off he went up stairs and said i talked to kiff and kiff made the announcement came as a shock really its hard to lose somebody like that
8067429 sit and worry about what will happen three years from now if i do that or this
8067430 a troco de adotarmos uma pol tica neoliberal de ter transportando nossos produtos navios de bandeira estrangeira de ter fazendo prospec o de petr leo
8067431 n s tomamos a decis o de que n o era justo e n o era poss vel que um pa s da dimens o do brasil com a engenharia naval que tinha o brasil com a estrutura de constru o de navios e plataformas que tinha o brasil ficar importando essas plataformas esses navios de pa ses estrangeiros nada contra pa ses estrangeiros mas bem melhor a gente investir o dinheiro dentro do brasil gerar emprego para os brasileiros e portanto fazer a pol tica correta de distribui o de renda fazer com que a engenharia brasileira se renove e que a gente possa ser competidor

8067434 the us is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in the dprk democratic peoples republic of korea as it pleases just as it did in iraq
8067435 we have decided to immediately suspend disabling our nuclear facilities
8067436 were certainly in the process of stabilising in terms of housing although i wouldnt want to say were there yet what we can say with some level of certainty is that the sharp declines in home sales are behind us and were flattening out
8067437 its very much a reflection of whats been going on in the energy markets
8067438 confidence remains quite low principally because of concerns about employment prospects
8067439 its clear that it will still take some time to work through the downturn in housing
8067440 once housing prices stabilise that will signal a return to a housing industry that can contribute to economic growth
8067441 because he integrated baseball i was not sure what this meant but i knew it was wonderful
8067442 the stain of racial segregation beclouded american society blacks and whites pursued separate and unequal lives not just in the south but throughout the nation confronted by rigid barriers created by the color line african americans forged their own institutions and culture creating a world invisible to most whites but nonetheless vibrant innovative and distinctive baseball offered one of the most dynamic examples of this phenomenon
8067443 his book showed us exactly how we got to where we are
8067444 if george w bush was seeking re election wed be 20 points ahead
8067445 in arizona the only way to get around is by small private plane
8067446 we coach little league in the blue states and have gay friends in the red states
8067447 everything was clicking my lineman did a great job of giving me time and i just hit my receivers
8067448 he made great decisions when they blitzed he took off an ran and hit the open receivers andnthats what weve been teaching him he did a great job
8067449 it seems as if we have changed our driving behaviour rapidly and drastically
8067450 theres been a lot of coverage on how to squeeze a few extra miles out of your tank driving slowly is one way to do that
8067451 investigations by unama found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men fifteen other villagers were wounded or otherwise injured
8067452 this is matter of grave concern to the united nations i have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations the impact of such operations undermines the trust and confidence of the afghan people in efforts to build a just peaceful and law abiding state
8067453 the patience of the afghan people has run out we no longer can afford to see the killing of our children
8067454 i want to remind all parties engaged in the conflict that the protection of civilians must be their primary concern they must respect their duties under international humanitarian and human rights law to protect the people we are here to serve
8067455 i would be in my bedroom and i was supposed to be asleep
8067456 and he would come in and he would pull up my nightgown and he would put his hands down my underwear
8067457 my mom would be in the shower and then when the shower turned off he would leave
8067458 i was afraid i would hurt her and i was afraid of him
8067459 because i was afraid it would hurt my mom and it would tear my family apart
8067460 hes also a very dedicated police officer ryan will describe how he conducted his investigation and i say his investigation because he takes this very seriously these allegations are serious and he works hard to make the case and to prove the truth
8067461 detective allar clever hard working detective that he is in a very subtle very sophisticated way pulled a confession out of a man for events that never occurred never
8067462 because its so hard to answer i have many interests and i like keeping busy and working on several projects at the same time right now im developing an arts centre i dont see myself as a person who just does one thing i understand that sometimes that might sound a bit unprofessional but i disagree
8067463 it is a bunch of things i like to create to do something new something that does not have a predictable outcome i love art and this project excites me and it has an incredible potential to be immensely challenging and satisfying of course everyone wants to make a difference and help people or provide things they would be happy to see
8067464 i have had an interest in art since childhood i loved to draw as a child and still do though
8067465 i wont pretend to be the biggest connoisseur of the contemporary artists of today
8067466 sometimes you see photographers in places you would not expect but overall it is pretty calm
8067467 when youre 10 you dont realise its difficult its an adventure when youre in a situation that is foreign to you you just have to pull yourself together and adapt
8067468 you dont buy that kind of thing unless you really want to show off what a big collector you are
8067469 i have never been a collector i have a few pieces that i got for my birthdays or that i bought for myself i acquire things that speak to me and put them on my wall when i see things i like i just know
8067470 the first priority is not when will there be a first women president of russia but when the president will be someone not chosen by the oligarchs and the vlast the powers that be
8067471 i definitely feel russian i feel russian but at the same time when im in the states i feel at home too i dont know if this is a patriotic gesture or just a lucky coincidence
8067472 i just saw the building and thought what a great place nothing ever turns out the way you plan it or imagine it
8067473 people will come and see the space because of abramovichs name he buys significant art works giving a sense of assurance to those who are not yet sure whether its worth collecting contemporary art and garage has an opportunity to become moscows tate modern it will be for tourists art professionals and just for ordinary people who want to know more about the taste of the wealthiest man in russia
8067474 dashas reputation is controversial people who know her adore her those who were accidentally not invited to the garage private opening already started hating her
8067475 they are afraid of it the level of appreciation is just not there and the government does not support contemporary art
8067476 dasha is very intelligent and she educates herself very quickly about everything to do with the art world i think she will be able to bring this to a new audience here its certainly one of the most original spaces in moscow
8067477 it will be very upsetting and distasteful if its all just a game lets all go and live in london lets all collect art now to develop this kind of project you need a big plan and i hope they have one if theyre just playing at contemporary art the sooner its over the better but if this is their lifes work then it merits respect if its serious then its worthy to develop something like this in moscow requires a lot of energy and huge material investment because russian art deserves this kind of legacy
8067478 dashas reputation in the art world is not yet well established
8067479 as people tend to think she is like a moth that flies to the light to strengthen the russian side of her character she would need to make more friends in moscow just to become native which is quite realistic given her russian childhood people talk of her as an exotic fruit from overseas
8067480 this is kind of a bet the company kind of issue

8067659 cutting off support that will save the lives of thousands of american troops
8067660 and look tim if you tell me ive got to take away this protection for these kids in order to win the election some things arent worth it some things are worth losing over that would be worth losing over hundreds of lives are being saved and will be saved by us sending these vehicles over which we are funding with this supplemental legislation and i want to ask any of my other colleagues would they in fact vote to cut off the money for those troops to protect them thats the right question this isnt cutting off the war this is cutting off support that will save the lives of thousands of american troops
8067661 i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
8067662 would i make a blanket commitment to meet unconditionally with the leaders of each of those countries within the first year i was elected president absolutely positively no
8067663 the last thing you want to do is telegraph to the folks in pakistan that were about to violate quote their sovereignty
8067664 a nd im told senator obama announced today senator lantos sic and i wrote into law the requirement that the aid to pakistan be conditioned upon their support of us going after al qaeda in their western province it already is a law the question the way to deal with it is not to announce it is to do it the last thing you want to do is telegraph to the folks in pakistan that were about to violate quote their sovereignty putting musharraf in a position that makes it virtually impossible for him to do anything other than what hes done basically cut a deal with the warlords along that border to our great detriment so its not something you talk about
8067665 the biden for president campaign today congratulated sen barack obama for arriving at a number of sen bidens long held views on combating al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan much of what senator obama has proposed senator biden has already initiated or accomplished
8067666 biden campaign congratulates sen obama for johnny come lately position
8067667 saddam poses no imminent and direct threat to the united states or to his neighbors
8067668 s addam poses no imminent and direct threat to the united states or to his neighbors that the iraqi economy is in shambles that the iraqi military a fraction of its former strength and that in concert with the international community he can be contained until in the way of all petty dictators he falls away into the dustbin of history
8067669 helped to authorize and engineer the biggest foreign policy disaster in our generation
8067670 well look i find it amusing that those who helped to authorize and engineer the biggest foreign policy disaster in our generation are now criticizing me for making sure that we are on the right battlefield and not the wrong battlefield in the war against terrorism
8067671 this is a guy whos used weapons of mass destruction this is a guy whos destabilized the whole neighborhood this is a guy who in a war with the iranians over 800 000 people on both sides were killed this is a guy who is an extreme danger to the world and this is a guy who is in every way possible seeking weapons of mass destruction that case in and of itself ought to be sufficient
8067672 if the president of the united states was saying four years ago clear evidence of mass destruction do we have any choice but to eliminate saddam hussein and the threat
8067673 i still believe that saddam possessed weapons of mass destruction
8067674 i still believe that saddam possessed weapons of mass destruction and that the war in iraq was justified
8067675 statement of senator joe biden on the white houses acknowledgment that iraq uranium assertion was wrong
8067676 i mean look the president had a choice and it was a tough choice when he came when 9 11 occurred he could either listen to the advice colin powell and shinseki and most of the uniformed military and john mccain as well and dick lugar and others or choose the advice of the vice president secretary of state the secretary of defense and others and he chose the wrong advice and this i think we need a fresh start to be able to gain any momentum on this war on terror and i dont think were going to see any change id feel a lot better if i knew that president bush was going to be elected and im not being solicitous if i knew he was going to start to listen to john mccain instead of the secretary of defense because they have totally different no i shouldnt say totally many have very different views of how to proceed and so i think youd see a difference in the way how you prosecute the war in iraq i think youd see a difference in how you dealt with homeland security and i think youd see a difference in terms of the cooperation with other nations in terms of getting the consensus on how to deal with controlling chemical biological nuclear weapons
8067677 and so ive believed for a long time a view shared by my republican colleague john mccain and many others as well that we need more force in iraq thats not a popular position to take but we need more force now in order to have less force later we need to gain control of security in iraq
8067678 you may end up going against a senate colleague perhaps mccain perhaps frist
8067679 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
8067680 sen joe biden of delaware a former presidential candidate and longtime senator he could help obama with perceived shortcomings on experience especially with foreign policy
8067681 what americans are looking for is not washington experience but do you have life experience that is gonna lead you to make good decisions
8067682 i do think that increasingly what americans are looking for is not washington experience but do you have life experience that is gonna lead you to make good decisions and are you in touch with whats happening on the ground
8067683 what i was drawing on in dealing with iraq was a set of experiences that come from a life of living overseas having family overseas being able to see the world through the eyes of people outside our borders
8067684 and i have to remind them when i hear this you know dick cheney and donald rumsfeld had two of the longest resumes in washington they did and led us into the worst foreign policy disaster in a generation so long resumes dont guarantee good judgment
8067685 obamas n h swing the clinton brand human rights growing up in a muslim country
8067686 the sort of general notion of experience based on longevity in washington i dont think is sufficient to make the case to the voters of iowa or the american people
8067687 you should keep on doing the same things with the same people over and over again and somehow expect a different outcome and thats the definition of madness
8067688 what washington is really telling you is that you should keep on doing the same things with the same people over and over again and somehow expect a different outcome and thats the definition of madness doing the same things over and over again and expecting something different
8067689 the idea is to maintain a unified iraq by decentralizing it and giving kurds shiites and sunnis their own regions the central government would be responsible for common interests like border security and the distribution of oil revenues it would require a regional non aggression pact overseen by the u n security council and it would allow us to responsibly withdraw most u s forces from iraq by the end of 2007
8067690 his broader proposal calls for a political solution that would provide regional autonomy for shiites sunnis and kurds and guarantees by the central government that sunnis would share in the countrys oil revenues
8067691 prince turki told a conference on washingtons relations with the arab world that dividing iraq into three regions reflecting its shiite sunni and kurdish populations would be a disaster
8067692 to envision that you can divide iraq into three parts is to envision ethnic cleansing on a massive scale sectarian killing on a massive scale and uprooting of families
8067693 many middle east experts are horrified by the difficulty of dividing the nation
8067694 you talk too much and you say things without thinking about them norman ornstein a friend and admirer told the senator as he was gearing up for his candidacy i know ive got to be more disciplined biden replied

8067923 they understand as long as they get the birthday cake
8067924 theyre coming here to save some money to pay their bus pass to fill their gas tank
8067925 the gap between the rich and poor will become bigger
8067926 and we expect the inequality numbers in pennsylvania to get worse

8067945 kalau dari rasionya seharusnya konsumsi elpiji yang menggantikan minyak tanah minimal 1 200 ton per hari jadi selama ini siapa yang memperdagangkan minyak tanah yang jumlahnya sebesar itu

8067952 but england is not my problem any more the only thing i am worried about or bothered about is being successful with fc twente
8067953 they have given me an opportunity to work in holland at a good club with good people and i want to pay them back
8067954 i had really a good day last thursday in toronto and then it felt terrible
8067955 its much better today the neck locked up for a couple of days
8067956 the signs are we are going in the right direction thats why we got the mris to see whats going on
8067957 if it continues to progress in the right direction the guys in the trainers room know what to do well just take it a day at a time
8067958 what makes this place so special i dont think is the building its whats happened in this stadium so many great players and great teams have come through here
8067959 weve got a good five weeks here for me to rehab and get a good sense of how im recovering and what it looks like
8067960 then i think we will all have a better idea
8067961 my focus right now is trying to get a little better range of motion each day from now until the end of the season and then start worrying about all that other stuff
8067962 now what do you do throw out a red handkerchief whats the format what do you do id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie
8067963 imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8067964 nobodys told us anything i think we should be schooled on it somehow
8067965 this is not going to work come on i shouldnt say it nots going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8067966 i think that it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8067967 its a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time and theyve done a very good job with difficult situations in all aspects
8067968 so they made the call wrong once in a while weve all done things wrong once in a while
8067969 immediately remove the advertisement from any television cable network or other media outlet where it is currently running
8067970 remove the ad from the american issues projects web site
8067971 directly infringing on the free history projects copyright in the film
8067972 we were shocked and dismayed to see that material from our film was taken and used in this manner our goal in making the weather underground was to produce an even handed and fair account of a turbulent period in american history we would never authorize anyone to make use of the film for the purposes of divisive partisan politics
8067973 immediately remove the advertisement from any television cable network or other media outlet where it is currently running
8067974 remove the ad from the american issues projects web site

8067977 the next round of foreclosures could come over the next several months as a result of continued job losses in the u s in addition to the nearly 660 000 u s jobs lost since december global insight is currently forecasting another 600 000 jobs lost over the rest of 2008 and into the first quarter of 2009
8067978 will be associated with interest only loans made between 2005 and 2007 newport said in those loans borrowers only pay the interest for the first five to seven years before they start paying off the principal at which time their monthly payments increase
8067979 i think in most cases they were just given to people who shouldnt have gotten loans
8067980 a lot of these homes are going to be deeply underwater when the monthly mortgage payment shoots up and there will be a very strong incentive for people to just walk away from their homes
8067981 everyone else in denver seems like they want this obama guy to win
8067982 so i go up there and pretty soon i am between the protesters and the cops on the front lines
8067983 there was one guy behind me who kept yelling over me at the cops fuck the police what are you gonna do this is a police state he wouldnt stop and he was drunk and smoking a cigarette after long enough i turned and said hey man what do you think you think the cops are going to step down if you keep yelling at them like that just be patient and let this thing work itself out he stopped but then he said to me he said okay but i dont appreciate your tone can you believe that
8067984 im just like you i began in a small room in an undistinguished neighborhood and look how far i have come
8067985 and you know what struck me when i first met barack was that even though he had this funny name even though hed grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did like my family they scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves
8067986 and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
8067987 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
8067988 ladies and gentlemen my wife jill who youll meet soon is drop dead gorgeous my wife jill who youll meet soon she also has her doctorate degree which is a problem but all kidding aside my jill my jill my wife jill and i are honored to join barack and michelle on this journey because thats what it is

8068014 i want to make sure that we have the highest public safeguards and safety nets in place thats where my focus has been

8068018 failed to maintain a level of sanitariness suitable to prevent the contamination of food products
8068019 if the maple leaf foods defendant has exercised reasonable care in maintaining sanitary conditions that were suitable and had diligently been testing its products the food products in question would not have been recalled
8068020 the plaintiff became incredibly ill and was resultantly bed ridden for a period of three or four consecutive days after eating a recalled product

8068037 we have to be brave show confidence at all times and stay focused
8068038 it is a unique opportunity to make history and i have felt my players confidence i too am very confident in this team it will be a different game from the first leg because somebody has to score i am expecting a different opponent as well one more determined to keep the ball it could be harder for us yet it could also suit us
8068039 we know basel shipped three goals in their last game but they have been scoring a lot too i hope its a good sign for vit ria anyway

8068060 very early in the morning while it was still dark jesus got up left the house and went off to a solitary place where he prayed
8068061 yet the news about him spread all the more so that crowds of people came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses but jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed
8068062 after he had dismissed them he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray when evening came he was there alone
8068063 after leaving them he went up on a mountainside to pray

8068070 our favorite hymn in our seminary chapel in nigeria where i taught for nearly twenty years was
8068071 do not be foolish but understand what the will of the lord is and do not get drunk with wine for that is dissipation but be filled with the spirit speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody with your heart to the lord always giving thanks for all things in the name of our lord jesus christ to god even the father and be subject to one another in the fear of christ
8068072 the christian life is more than just a prayer of faith made in the past its dedicating every day to live for christ and what will last

8068085 suppose one of you wants to build a tower will he not first sit down and estimate the cost to see if he has enough money to complete it for if he lays the foundation and is not able to finish it everyone who sees it will ridicule him saying this fellow began to build and was not able to finish or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king will he not first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand if he is not able he will send a delegation while the other is still a long way off and ask for terms of peace
8068086 a 56 year old bus driver named dianne with many years of experience pulled into the sunset transit center shortly before noon she was running six minutes late and was eager to use the restroom i after waiting impatiently for her passengers to disembark dianne hurried off the bus leaving the engine in gear and running with no parking brake engaged she walked around to the front of the bus and reached in the drivers window to pull the lever that closed the door the bus is equipped with automatic brakes that keep it from moving as long as the doors are open once the doors shut the brakes release after a one and a half second delay as dianne passed in front of the bus again she suddenly found the 15 ton bus creeping slowly toward her she could have jumped out of the way in fact she could have ambled out of the way instead witnesses watched her push against the bus with her arms outstretched in an effort to stop it but the mass of a bus is more than 200 times the mass of an adult woman you do the math the bus did indeed stop eventually due to circumstances other than diannes efforts k paramedics arrived within minutes to find dianne dead beneath the bus

8068102 i think that it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8068103 its a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time and theyve done a very good job with difficult situations in all aspects
8068104 so they made the call wrong once in a while weve all done things wrong once in a while
8068105 kate does not know the plaintiffs and has never met with them or spoken with them her representatives believe that the claims are baseless and without merit and they intend to vigorously defend the lawsuit

8068108 nein nur ali ist grade nicht da der wurde letzte woche beschnitten
8068109 problematize the meanings of critique that have been developed for centuries
8068110 how not to governed like that not like that not for that not by them
8068111 68 is an intrusion of becoming people have sometimes wanted to view it as the reign of the imaginary but its absolutely not imaginary its a gust of the real in its pure state its inevitable that historians do not understand it properly i really believe in the difference between history and becoming may 68 was a becoming revolutionary without a revolutionary future after the fact people can always make fun of it
8068112 after the fact people can always make fun of it
8068113 they disabled institutions they made the exertion of authority impossible they publicly established themselves in illegality
8068114 violated the rules of the game that regulate the life of oppositions
8068115 the breach they are opening in the university is opened simultaneously in the little bureaucracies which have claimed the revolutionary demands and struggle for themselves
8068116 they would like to forget what has taken them by surprise reattach the discourse of today to that of yesterday and quickly take advantage of the occasion just like plunderers after an earthquake
8068117 history could just as well have omitted the event itself
8068118 but the trace of the rupture will remain even after the veil has been woven anew
8068119 what was new in the action undertaken at nanterre and why the university is a place from which the protest is able to spread to the rest of society
8068120 could be circumvented by sleight of hand if the students yield to the seduction of a new seemingly democratic pedagogy internalize what has been a predominantly external pressure and take on for example the grading and judgment of their own work if they thus make themselves the initiators of a regimentation that locks them into the grid of a narrowly specialized and quasi professional education
8068121 no all of this did not indicate that in the near future there would be barricades in the streets of paris and ten million people on strike
8068122 la forza dellanima consiste nel vincere le emozioni consiste nellarrestare i movimenti del corpo che le accompagnano la debolezza sta nel lasciarsi dominare dalle emozioni le quali essendo spesso contrarie tra di loro riducono lanima nello stato pi deplorevole e la annientano le emozioni non aiutano rendono meno razionale ci che le fa provare e meno ragionevole chi le prova rendono le persone vulnerabili
8068123 we certainly are except you are thin and young so they look perfect on you
8068124 his own essays collected in this book are also motivated by a wish to contribute to a certain balance of power in todays art world namely to find more space in it for art functioning as political propaganda
8068125 the dominating art discourse identifies art with art market and remains blind to any art that is produced and distributed by any mechanism other then the market
8068126 it is also interesting that even the most severe judgment on the moral dimensions of the free market never leads anybody to conclude that art that was and is produced under those market conditions should be excluded from critical and historical considerations
8068127 art becomes politically effective only when it is made beyond or outside the art market in the context of direct political propaganda
8068128 the regime of equal aesthetic rights for all art works
8068129 walking around linuxworld this year it was interesting to see the number of apple notebooks in the halls and various sessions it wasnt necessarily that there were more apple notebooks than linux machines but it was a good number and begs the question why do open source people seem to cut apple some slack when it comes to their very closed proprietary platform

8068132 i dont have a statement but i do have questions as an innocent man where do i go to get back the four years the department of justice stole from me as a taxpayer where do i go to get back the millions of dollars the fbi and justice department wasted persecuting me and as a citizen what must i do to have a justice department free of partisan corruption so profound it has turned on those it is sworn to protect
8068133 i am glad an innocent man has been vindicated steve kurtz stared in the face of the federal government and a twenty year prison term and never flinched because he believes in his work and his actions were those of a completely innocent man clients like him are a blessing and although i have had many important victories this one stands at the top of the list
8068134 this ruling is the best possible ending to a horrible ordeal but we are mindful of numerous cases still pending and the grave injustices perpetrated by the bush administration following 9 11 this case was part of a larger picture in which law enforcement was given expanded powers in this instance the bush administration was unsuccessful in its attempt to erode americans constitutional rights
8068135 the government has unlimited resources to bring and prosecute these kinds of charges but the accused often dont have any resources to defend themselves this victory could never have happened without the activism of thousands of people supporters protested vocally opposed the prosecution and refused to let it go on in silence and without their efforts at fundraising kurtz and ferrell would not have been able to defend themselves from these false accusations
8068136 blokes are sick of being told what they can and cant eat
8068137 theyve had a gutful of it and are going back to living by their own rules
8068138 if they feel like having a pie and a few beers theyll have a pie and a few beers
8068139 at the end of the day they cant move the more trendy stuff
8068140 a good meat pie is chunky and nice and tender
8068141 it doesnt worry me what brand it is as long as its nice and fresh
8068142 there are more people going to venues and more events held at the mcg
8068143 if it is due to anything it would be due to the increased patronage
8068144 theyre not that complicated they just want to be left to their own devices
8068145 search for a file you worked on in the past month in the finder
8068146 thus saith the lord cursed be the man that trusteth in man and maketh flesh his arm and whose heart departeth from the lord
8068147 for ye see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called that no flesh should glory in his presence
8068148 trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths
8068149 this i say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh
8068150 but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost is come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in all judaea and in samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth
8068151 i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me
8068152 for unto you it is given in the behalf of christ not only to believe on him but also to suffer for his sake
8068153 now all the tax collectors and the sinners were coming near him to listen to him
8068154 all of us like sheep have gone astray each of us has turned to his own way but the lord has caused the iniquity of us all to fall on him
8068155 so he told them this parable saying 4what man among you if he has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them does not leave the ninety nine in the open pasture and go after the one which is lost until he finds it
8068156 for the son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost
8068157 leave the ninety nine in the open pasture and go after the one which is lost
8068158 it is not those who are healthy who need a physician but those who are sick i did not come to call the righteous but sinners
8068159 when he has found it he lays it on his shoulders rejoicing
8068160 in reference to your former manner of life you lay aside the old self which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit 23and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind 24and put on the new self which in the likeness of god has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth
8068161 and when he comes home he calls together his friends and his neighbors saying to them rejoice with me for i have found my sheep which was lost
8068162 who do people say that the son of man is

8068169 mom my feet are so swollen i cant walk and they tell me i have this thing called pre eclampsia
8068170 we dont want the samak government because hes very corrupted and hes a nominee from the thaksin governments and thaksin is not really gone
8068171 he exploited thailand and took everything and hes got lots of money so he can pull the strings thaksin is behind everything and samak is a nominee he does everything for thaksin
8068172 we all believe that thaksin try to use all the money because the government here is subsidised from thaksin anyway
8068173 they try to use all the money and then we dont have any money then thaksin will try to come back
8068174 im a strong believer i think she must have had a guardian angel im so happy
8068175 i couldnt believe it but when i got down there i knew it was my cat because they all have their own voice
8068176 i really am dependent on someone my schedule is not really my own i depend upon people to come to my house and help me with everything
8068177 so i think i take advantage of opportunities that are out there and of course mda is one of them its just wonderful you can call on them and if they dont have the answer they try to find it and work with you its a wonderful organization really
8068178 i really feel grateful for the life i have i have family and friends who care about me i have my home ive adapted so i can get around in a wheelchair i have enough to heat and im warm in the winter and i just think you look around i have so many blessings
8068179 she is definitely a role model and i think thats so great and id like other people to be able to see that also that just because someone has a disability doesnt mean that theyre not in society working just as hard if not harder than everyone else
8068180 if i thought each day what i cant do id probably never get out of bed but i always think dont stew about things just do what you can to handle the situation
8068181 pleased and relieved that this ordeal may be coming to an end
8068182 we are all grateful that after reviewing this case judge arcara took appropriate action
8068183 this decision is further testament to our original statements that dr kurtz is completely innocent and never should have been charged in the first place

8068194 the bias is towards backing people who have some validation of success and relevant backgrounds if the entrepreneurs are very early in their professional careers then the iit iim tags matter more because they are proxies for successful pasts
8068195 very little if at all we must keep in mind that some people from iit iim have a over inflated view of themselves and are hard to work with so these tags are not always good news
8068196 hes ready to go friday and hes excited boston manager terry francona said

8068200 if it continues to progress in the right direction the guys in the trainers room know what to do well just take it a day at a time
8068201 what makes this place so special i dont think is the building its whats happened in this stadium so many great players and great teams have come through here francona said
8068202 any team can erect monuments the reason those monuments are up is because theyre great players thats no secret but were moving what 100 yards the only difference from where i sit their payroll will probably go up a bunch more make it harder for us

8068225 they call themselves the brethren three disgraced former judges doing time in a florida federal prison one was sent up for tax evasion another for skimming bingo profits and the third for a career ending drunken joyride meeting daily in the prison law library taking exercise walks in their boxer shorts these judges turned felons can reminisce about old court cases dispense a little jailhouse justice and contemplate where their lives went wrong or they can use their time in prison to get very rich very fast and so they sit sprawled in the prison library furiously writing letters fine tuning a wickedly brilliant extortion scam while events outside their prison walls begin to erupt a bizarre presidential election is holding the nation in its grips and a powerful government figure is pulling some very hidden strings for the brethren the timing couldnt be better because theyve just found the perfect victim

8068234 as you can see our campus is in mint condition very beautiful
8068235 setting up iim kozhikode and now iim shillong in such inaccessible locations is a ploy by the authorities to destroy all that we the older iims have built over decades this is timed to coincide with the appointment of new directors at iims a b and c leaving our institutes running around like headless chicken oops

8068244 once he was a well liked well paid young partner in a thriving mississippi law firm then patrick lanigan stole ninety million dollars from his own firm and ran for his life for four years he evaded men who were rich powerful and would stop at nothing to find him then inevitably on the edge of the brazilian jungle they finally tracked him down now patrick is coming home and in the mississippi city where it all began an extraordinary trial is about to begin as prosecutors circle like sharks as patricks lawyer prepares his defense as patricks lover prays for his deliverance and his former partners wait for their revenge another story is about to emerge because patrick lanigan the most reviled white collar criminal of his time knows something that no one else in the world knows he knows the truth
8068245 eles n o se interessam pela divis o racial esse assunto os entedia

8068257 estoy satisfecho con el comportamiento del equipo y encantado de la vida por pasar una eliminatoria muy peligrosa
8068258 me pilll muy lejos porque yo tapaba el primer palo
8068259 es una an cdota espero no ser quien resuelva arriba
8068260 esto era una eliminatoria y la hemos ganado por 4 1
8068261 estamos en la champions y eso es lo m s importante para el club
8068262 claro que duele la derrota pero no hay reproche en el c mo ya estamos en europa
8068263 and do you think that if it happens that obama is elected or even just being nominated will send positive ripple effects throughout the country on the race issue
8068264 i think that it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8068265 its a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time and theyve done a very good job with difficult situations in all aspects
8068266 so they made the call wrong once in a while weve all done things wrong once in a while
8068267 i got some great feedback from indian students as well as the faculty at the university of california my research also left me very impressed by the curriculum and the calibre of finance faculty and the institutes previous placement records were in fact the clincher

8068273 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
8068274 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
8068275 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
8068276 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
8068277 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
8068278 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use

8068280 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
8068281 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
8068282 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
8068283 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
8068284 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
8068285 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
8068286 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
8068287 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
8068288 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
8068289 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
8068290 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
8068291 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
8068292 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
8068293 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
8068294 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
8068295 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
8068296 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
8068297 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
8068298 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
8068299 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
8068300 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
8068301 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
8068302 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
8068303 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
8068304 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
8068305 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
8068306 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness

8068431 even using the most optimistic forecasts for levels of domestic graduates and of migration into australia ict skills shortages will continue or get worse at least until 2012
8068432 this is a worrying trend considering the strategic importance of ict sector to the australian economy
8068433 this may be due to the incorrect perception that there are few jobs in the ict industry nothing could be further from the truth the ict job market is very buoyant both in australia and overseas governments must act to increase employment in the national ict sector it is an economic necessity

8068483 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8068484 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8068485 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8068486 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8068487 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8068488 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8068489 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of

8068497 i will wrestle you till you ask more of me
8068498 i will be your god and i will never let you go and i will reveal myself to you though not till afterwards will you recognize that it was me
8068499 i will wrestle you till you ask more of me
8068500 i think a big reason evolutionists believe what they believe is they dont want to have to be ruled by god said josh rou 17
8068501 christ is here depicted for us as an inexhaustable spring which continually overflows with goodness and grace therefore one bears the name christian not because he does a whole lot but rather because he recieves something from christ
8068502 if you look at what you are doing then you have already lost the name christian it is certainly true that a man should do good deeds help others give counsel and aid but from this no one can be called a christian and in fact he is no christian just on that account
8068503 a christian takes his name from christ he never takes his name from works

8068505 the west nile infection rates weve detected among mosquitoes this summer are the highest weve seen in nine years

8068514 its a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time and theyve done a very good job with difficult situations in all aspects
8068515 so they made the call wrong once in a while weve all done things wrong once in a while

8068530 whle the other 10 sets of bones were catalogued the holy remains were left outside in a courtyard and stolen before further tests could be carried out
8068531 lets all wake up the post cold war peace is over
8068532 we are now in an arms race with a new superpower whose goal is to contain and overtake the united states
8068533 in global terms art prices rose eighteen percent over the previous year the higher prices were accompanied by a higher total fine art market revenue at 9 2 billion up 43 8 percent compared with 2006 and driven by a substantially higher number of sales above the million dollar line
8068534 helps establish authenticity and prevent art fraud and theft and the ability to identify and register their purchases
8068535 the website features tabloid style attacks and negative blogs and offers no reliable means of authenticating any artwork
8068536 we are a brick and mortar company with international reach
8068537 our experts and art historians do research its not just a matter of clicking a mouse and paying a fee anyone who just started up cannot hope to have the capability we have
8068538 you apply the tags photograph the pieces and register each one on the far web site so there is a permanent record in our database with all relevant information the images of the piece will appear in your portfolio gallery on the far web site
8068539 collectors looking for art to buy for their collections can browse the far galleries or find work by specific artists and buy with the security of knowing that the provenance of the pieces is established and authentic
8068540 just with a photo you cant tell someone would have to come out and do a physical examination of the piece
8068541 fine art registry offers a basic application it registers items on a web site
8068542 but what exactly is the function of a registry in terms of artwork
8068543 i saw one of my originals on ebay at a very low price and i thought id buy it just to get my artwork back i dont want my artwork out there at that price
8068544 so i bought it on ebay and when i got it back it was actually a greeting card
8068545 if youre selling works by major names youve got to be able to demonstrate that what youre dealing with is authentic thats absolutely critical if you have galleries that have a good reputation in the business and who are meticulous about the way they track down the provenance of all the works obviously from a collectors point of view youve got much more security in knowing youre buying something authentic id much rather buy a picasso from park west gallery or some dealer thats got a good reputation than from a gallery thats privately run by a husband and wife team who dont have the credentials from them id happily buy a southwest art giclee for over my couch
8068546 if i took a picture of a piece that i had how could they verify it without looking at it and diagnosing the signature
8068547 i could send them a chinese knock off of one of my disney fine art paintings and they could say what it is and when it was produced but it could be from china so i dont understand sending an e mail or a picture to validate what something is
8068548 if people running the sites do not have an innate understanding of the industry and products and make certain judgments without foundation their sites can be detrimental
8068549 without a basis of information and scholarly contacts a website or any business for that matter could be detrimental because a consumer may only see that site and if they make a judgment based on the information given on that site it could negatively impact the art the artist the gallery and the industry
8068550 its always about whos running the site and their credentials
8068551 you have to have art physically looked at whenever possible by the artist themselves or truly established experts who can work without prejudice
8068552 we dont recognize it at all we have letters from field to mr albaretto saying im sorry i didnt have some of your information in my book im going to add it as i do my addenda but hochman railroaded the book away from field at the end of his life and corrupted what many people consider to be a trusted reference you see it all the time if its not in the field book its a fake and thats just not true
8068553 i take exception to that concept because unless an art dealer is given the opportunity to personally view a work of art theres no way of knowing where that stickers gong to end up or whether they affix it to a real work of art
8068554 in general the art community is an honest community its not ridden with problems but from time to time you hear of situations that raise a red flag
8068555 as an art dealer not only do we need to know the art we need to know whos selling it what theyre about through the years weve heard of people who may be less than authentic and so you stay away from them
8068556 im not sure that one company can take this on by themselves
8068557 if one company is doing it and that company goes out of business bam youre stuck with nothing
8068558 there might have to be a governmental agency that legislates a standard for the industry but im hesitant to say that because that in itself is a whole can of worms
8068559 steve garvey saw me hit and said youve played before you have a great swing
8068560 i waited an hour and a half to go then when i got up there they said oh congressman you didnt need to wait
8068561 would you allow one of our people to come down and verify the body
8068562 the only person we would allow to come down and verify the body was the real bigfoot hunter tom biscardi

8068571 i think we have to admit to ourselves that we are confronting the behavior of a death cult among millions and millions of muslims not 10 000 who went to training camps in afghanistan we are confronting an endorsement of this kind of behavior and a reflexive political solidarity where muslims side with other muslims no matter how sociopathic their behavior simply because theyre other muslims we cant deny the problem while trying to encourage a more benign face of the religion
8068572 statements like there are millions of muslims who have this sort of death cult are profoundly inaccurate and are based on nothing except your sort of general impression of a region and of a religion that you have a very surface understanding of
8068573 even if it were only five percent of the muslim world that was radicalized by my lights that is still a problem we have to talk about soberly i mean still were talking about 75 million people
8068574 and i dont think anybody would say that its not a conversation that we need to talk about
8068575 both of those comments that the difference between judaism christianity and islam is that judaism and christianity have gone through some sort of reform and so that its tempered its violent aspects and islam hasnt both of those statements are false
8068576 have used the language of religion to give voice to that resistance in very extreme and very unusual cases that identity that attack on an identity that language leads to horrific acts of violence again i think that thats a real its a real sort of oversimplification of a very complex issue that has much more to do with ones identity than it does to with ones faith

8068638 y ser fundamental ganar como sea y empezar a sumar para conseguir la calificaci n
8068639 el grupo en el que estamos est muy apretado es por eso que tenemos que ganar s o s no podemos dejar ir m s puntos si no queremos quedar relegados en nuestro sector hay que pensar en salir a ganar desde ma ana
8068640 ante jaguares dejamos ir el triunfo y es nuestra responsabilidad y ahora estamos m s comprometidos para sacar los puntos que faltan

8068643 estamos en estrecha comunicaci n con el cuerpo m dico tratando de apoyar en lo que le corresponde a la directiva
8068644 la manera de hacerlo es enfrentando en lo que nos equivocamos yo me equivoco como dirigente y lo acepto ante los jugadores en chivas no nos da miedo intentar y no nos preocupa si no hay aceptaci n y autocr tica no hay cambio
8068645 los resultados comenzar n a llegar en la medida que se rectifique sobre lo que se ha hecho mal hasta el momento estoy seguro que tienen que haber cambios para enderezar el rumbo de un equipo que est acostumbrado siempre a ganar
8068646 santos nos evidenci las fallas en la defensa todav a no se integra bien olvera es normal porque dur un a o sin jugar reynoso creo que le quebraron la cintura un par de veces y sali adolorido en el segundo tiempo mejoramos y hay un gran m rito al analizar esa parte

8068650 considero que la tecnolog a extraordinaria con que contamos ahora merece el uso de la repetici n instant nea en t rminos bastante delimitados el sistema que hemos instalado se asegurar que se tomen las decisiones justas en los jonrones y no provocar un retraso significativo en el juego
8068651 mi oposici n a uso ilimitado de la repetici n instant nea sigue bastante vigente realmente creo que el deporte ha prosperado durante poco m s de un siglo por hacer las cosas que hemos hecho
8068652 aunque el uso de la repetici n instant nea es todav a un experimento esperamos que al hacer un balance de esta temporada resulte ser todo un xito
8068653 la fortaleza f sica de carlos ha sido indispensable para llegar a este punto terapia intermedia la fase m s aguda y grave la hemos pasado
8068654 la hinchaz n cerebral que era nuestra mayor preocupaci n ya pas de ser cr tica

8068658 no creo que hayamos dado un paso atr s en nuestra preparaci n quiz s no fuimos tan precisos pero tuvimos un oponente que tambi n juega y tuvimos cinco o seis ocasiones en las que s lo nos quedaba el portero por vencer perdimos pero pudimos haber ganado o empatado
8068659 tendremos una reinauguraci n muy especial dedicada a la fundaci n s ndrome de down y es que hemos querido ampliar los ofrecimientos del parque de los ni os y hacerlo un rea donde en verdad puedan venir a disfrutar todos los ni os

8068662 quiero recordar que toda absolutamente toda la preparaci n de estas semanas estaba encaminada dirigida a pasar este dif cil trance
8068663 de ah mi alegr a pues ma ana veremos c mo el nombre del bar a aparece de nuevo entre los grandes de europa
8068664 no tengo queja alguna de mis jugadores todo lo contrario
8068665 su actitud con algunos matices fue excelente e intentaron todo lo que nos propusimos hemos eliminado a un rival de entidad y aunque intentamos que los jugadores no pensasen en el 4 0 de la ida es evidente que no lo conseguimos del todo
8068666 si lo preguntan por el partido del domingo en numancia les dir que aquello es otra historia vamos a ir por los tres puntos y lo haremos con nuestro mejor equipo hay que empezar la liga ganando
8068667 cualquier derrota duele por supuesto pero como no tengo reproches que hacer a mis jugadores ganamos en la ida y hemos pasado la eliminatoria el dolor es menor
8068668 considero que la tecnolog a extraordinaria con que contamos ahora merece el uso de la repetici n instant nea en t rminos bastante delimitados el sistema que hemos instalado se asegurar que se tomen las decisiones justas en los jonrones y no provocar un retraso significativo en el juego
8068669 mi oposici n a uso ilimitado de la repetici n instant nea sigue bastante vigente realmente creo que el deporte ha prosperado durante poco m s de un siglo por hacer las cosas que hemos hecho
8068670 aunque el uso de la repetici n instant nea es todav a un experimento esperamos que al hacer un balance de esta temporada resulte ser todo un xito
8068671 la campa a que est por iniciar ser f sicamente demandante pues por el sistema de competencia jugaremos en dos ocasiones contra aut nticos tigres y borregos monterrey por eso se modificaron las cargas de trabajo con el fin de evitar que los jugadores lleguen muy desgastados
8068672 en lo particular a m no me gust como se dieron las cosas creo que se deb an analizar m s opciones antes de cortar de tajo con el sistema de juego que se ven a manejando desde hace tiempo pues de alguna forma permiti el crecimiento del deporte en nuestro pa s
8068673 es lamentable para los jugadores no poder enfrentar a equipos como aguilas blancas o pumas cu pero ahora debemos trabajar para volver a ser el equipo dominante que fuimos hace algunos a os
8068674 el dolor de cabeza es un s ntoma inespec fico
8068675 el dolor de cabeza fuerte depende mucho de cada persona la percepci n y las caracter sticas del mismo adem s que no se puede medir
8068676 antes de cada pr ctica se revisa al jugador se hace una evaluaci n y se da aviso al t cnico si est en condiciones de jugar
8068677 puedo asegurar que carlos no me mencion ning n dolor de cabeza
8068678 ese fue su problema desde que lleg de san luis
8068679 santos es un equipo que le tenemos respeto y vamos a ir a jugar a su cancha con lo que tecos sabe hacer nosotros siempre nos hemos sentido fuertes y contra santos no va a ser la excepci n
8068680 es un equipo con grandes individualidades en la delantera pero tambi n nosotros tenemos jugadores que tienen una gran capacidad para hacer goles por lo que ser un partido atractivo
8068681 creo que para todos santos es favorito por ser el campe n y por lo que demostr en su ltimo partido ante chivas pero confiamos en nuestros jugadores que son de primer nivel y estoy seguro que vamos a sacar un buen resultado
8068682 todos los compa eros sabemos que tecos est para grandes cosas y aunque hemos dejado escapar puntos importantes el equipo siempre se fortalece

8068700 in a bit of historical revisionism swift boat veterans for truth founder and unfit for command co author john oneill distorted jerome corsis role in co authoring the book
8068701 simply an editor and not really any sort of co author
8068702 unfit book materials show corsi more than just an editor
8068703 one of the authors of a new anti john kerry book frequently posted comments on a conservative web site describing muslims and catholics as pedophiles and pope john paul ii as senile in chat room entry last year on freerepublic com corsi writes islam is a peaceful religion just as long as the women are beaten the boys buggered and the infidels are killed in another entry he says so this is what the last days of the catholic church are going to look like buggering boys undermines the moral base and the lawyers rip the gold off the vatican altars we may get one more pope when this senile one dies but thats probably about it
8068704 the real reason behind president bushs push for immigration reform says author jerome r
8068705 the late great usa the coming merger with mexico and canada
8068706 any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11
8068707 yesterday jerome corsi was prattling on about the north american union again after michael medved deservedly spanked him for spreading conspiracy theories while i dont think corsi is any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11 i thought i would respond to him one last time i think thats about the fourth time ive said that now why respond again whats the point well unfortunately a lot of conservatives consider this conspiracy theory to be so preposterous that they believe its beneath them to even bother discussing it and that leaves corsi and his ilk to dominate the debate and since there are a lot of conservatives being taken in by this north american union nonsense somebody has got to step up to the plate
8068708 i guess there are people who believe in the plan for a north american union but there are people who believe in bigfoot
8068709 all his life jerome corsis been told that were running out of oil
8068710 i remember driving with my dad in a 1952 plymouth and listening to him talk about the end of oil
8068711 im at the point where the dinosaur theory seems silly
8068712 you take a pile of cats and you bury them dig them up 10 years later and you dont get oil
8068713 the truth is that there is so much oil around the world that its been easy to find
8068714 were awash in oil theres more oil today in proven reserves than ever before in human history
8068715 after their bitter campaign 2004 experience with the swift boat veterans for truth john kerry and his fellow dems arent waiting to be shot at again yesterday aides to sens kerry hillary clinton joe biden and ted kennedy jumped all over literary mugger jerome corsi co author of the kerry bashing best seller unfit for command they knocked him to the ground and kicked him in the face metaphorically anyway over his next democrattrashing tome atomic iran how the terrorist regime bought the bomb and american politicians the book which nashvilles cumberland house publishing wont release till next month claims democratic pols are being corrupted by iranian money and helping the nuke seeking mullahs in tehran

8068735 nuke the islam nazis and lets move on no more muslamo fascists
8068736 islam has declared world war iii against everything non muslim
8068737 when will the liberal media wake up to see that islam has declared a world war against everyting non muslim may allah be damned to the hell muslims wish to create on earth
8068738 may islam join the garbage heap of worthless religions we have grown beyond any believers of hermes out there
8068739 all arab muslims lie the koran endorses lying to infidels namely us none of these names are real abdallah is really mohammad mohammad mohammad readily altered to include atta or haj or whatever else they decide to call themselves for the moment
8068740 gotta love this stupid religion islam makes the nazis look like a sunday stroll in the park islam its gotta be straight from hell just the devil in disguise that seems to about sum it up

8068748 i repeat muslims cancer cells its hard to tell the difference no doctor worries about the first amendment rights of cancer cells the therapy is to eliminate cancer cells so the body can go on living great to repeat it keeps the thread going let the muslims stop preaching terror and ill revise my view meanwhile muslims cancer cells is an equation that works
8068749 may all these arab maniacs explode and kill themselves next time maybe they will take arab rat with them best solution to the homicide bombers is that they eliminate themselves with as little loss to civilians as possible

8069015 president bush appealed again today for more time for his iraq strategy to work but this time with a new rationale
8069016 president bushs rationale is clearly shifting from policing sectarian violence to targeting al qaeda the president linked al qaeda terrorists in iraq directly to osama bin laden but this is a clear contradiction of the january speech setting limits on us involvement

8069018 sometimes we forget that our two major ethnic groups africans and british first arrived on the same ship
8069019 must not be seen as being only for persons of african descent
8069020 the relationship between the people arriving on those ships into barbados was certainly not one of equality
8069021 the slave was kept penned up in darkened unsanitary holds below deck and the whites were either the slave catchers the slave owners the seamen who had no respect sympathy or feelings of equality for the other passengers that is to say the slaves
8069022 for a minister with that portfolio to propagate this is to refuse to acknowledge a more modern day equivalent of that imbalance in the relationship meaning he only has to look at the plantation system in barbados which existed probably in the same way that it existed years and years ago to see that the slave in spite of his emancipation had become a cane field worker and remained in that status for many years in spite of certain enfranchisement
8069023 the risk is of creating a neo colonial pact for the provision of non value added raw materials in the producing countries and unacceptable work conditions for agricultural workers

8069042 i have gone back and forth on this because as a player youll always want to play youll never lose that urge to be out there but i could only do this if i could commit 100 percent physically mentally emotionally and i cant do that ive tried to convince myself and my body to give it one more year but in the end i just dont think i could turn it on like i need to again

8069049 with all other diabetes medications we know there has been pancreatitis and some of those people have died
8069050 what struck me when i first met barack was that even though he had this funny name and even though he had grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine
8069051 he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did
8069052 he tends to address issues in kind of a professorial way showing his very considerable intellect and argumentative skills but people wonder whether or not he is really in some sense one of them culturally and i think if i was the obama campaign i would be trying to establish his links with ordinary american lives
8069053 what i think people like about him is the sense that he is a fighter you know that is someone who is going to go out there and take the fight to john mccain and really show some emotion about the issues we are working on
8069054 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and for me our country will be committed his cause the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on

8069086 whereas the tenth amendment to the constitution of the united states reads as follows the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people and whereas the tenth amendment defines the total scope of federal power as being that specifically granted by the constitution of the united states and no more and whereas the scope of power defined by the tenth amendment means that the federal government was created by the states specifically to be an agent of the states and whereas today in 2008 the states are demonstrably treated as agents of the federal government now therefore be it resolved by the house of representatives and the senate of the 2nd session of the 51st oklahoma legislature that the state of oklahoma hereby claims sovereignty under the tenth amendment to the constitution of the united states over all powers not otherwise enumerated and granted to the federal government by the constitution of the united states that this serve as notice and demand to the federal government as our agent to cease and desist effective immediately mandates that are beyond the scope of these constitutionally delegated powers
8069087 it is preposterous that the current members of the united states senate and all of their predecessors for more than 200 years havent been able to read the constitution and do what it says

8069093 the apparent unity previously marking anglican evangelicals was as their numbers grew and the world changed being overtaken by their plurality

8069097 jesus and not gordon brown presumably the modern equivalent of caesar is lord that is what i believe
8069098 yes they only lived a short while after declaring jesus to be lord but even in that short while they submitted their life to him and god graciously takes that into account
8069099 i ask all of you who worked so hard for me who knocked on doors and made those phone calls who got in arguments from time to time to work as hard for barack obama as you did for me

8069110 the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8069111 misrepresented the history and nature of the authentic teaching of the catholic church against abortion
8069112 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8069113 in the middle ages uninformed and inadequate theories about embryology led some theologians to speculate that specifically human life capable of receiving an immortal soul may not exist until a few weeks into pregnancy
8069114 these mistaken biological theories became obsolete over 150 years ago when scientists discovered that a new human individual comes into being from the union of sperm and egg at fertilization in keeping with this modern understanding the church teaches that from the time of conception fertilization each member of the human species must be given the full respect due to a human person beginning with respect for the fundamental right to life
8069115 we respect the right of elected officials such as speaker pelosi to address matters of public policy that are before them but the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops
8069116 given this responsibility to teach it is important to make this correction for the record
8069117 from the beginning the catholic church has respected the dignity of all human life from the moment of conception to natural death
8069118 on the separation of sense and state a clarification for the people of the church in northern colorado
8069119 ardent practicing catholics will quickly learn from the historical record that from apostolic times the christian tradition overwhelmingly held that abortion was grievously evil
8069120 but none diminished the unique evil of abortion as an attack on life itself and the early church closely associated abortion with infanticide in short from the beginning the believing christian community held that abortion was always gravely wrong
8069121 an inalienable right to live a right that the speaker of the house of representatives is bound to defend at all costs for the most basic of ethical reasons
8069122 i want barack obama to be president of this country
8069123 the democrats are the party of the rich and elite no matter what they try to tell us
8069124 america would easily vote for a competent black man such as michael steele or a competent black woman such as condoleezza rice in fact in the case of miss rice she may very well be the smartest woman in america she could easily become president if she so chooses
8069125 is there really room in the republican party for someone like you anymore
8069126 the republican party would be better without them and he would go back if they went away
8069127 it is not my job to stick up for the little guy i am to interpret the constitution and decide who is right
8069128 america the tract of land between the west coast and new york city
8069129 it is only through airing experiences such as this that any progress in society can be made 100 years ago it would have been an article on homosexuality
8069130 a network of organizations from six provinces working for the full inclusion of all the baptized regardless of gender socioeconomic status sexual orientation political party or theological perspective
8069131 a member of certain tribal societies who acts as a medium between the visible world and an invisible spirit world and who practices magic
8069132 the same rules of faithfulness and commitment would have to apply as to heterosexual union
8069133 to be to the declared teaching of the church i serve and thus to discourage any developments that might imply that the position and convictions of the worldwide communion have changed
8069134 if im asked for my views as a theologian rather than a church leader i have to be honest and admit that they are as ive said
8069135 has spoken out frequently against the foot in the door tactic of divisive innovation such as the consecration of the present bishop of new hampshire
8069136 the archbishop has said repeatedly that there is a difference between thinking aloud as a theologian and the task of a bishop let alone an archbishop to uphold the churchs teaching
8069137 if a woman could feed and minister to the body of christ in the flesh can a woman not also feed and minister to the body of christ in the spirit
8069138 he is able to offer very strong support to other clergy and parishes
8069139 he has a great deal of church experience and runs a parish where people simply are coming to the church in their hundreds
8069140 i have written to the bishop of and asked him to put the protection of children above the protection of the churchs priests and i am waiting for a response
8069141 i was first made aware of these matters by the police two weeks ago and i immediately wrote to child protection and the bishop of the rt rev
8069142 i am yet to receive any answers to my questions in my letter to the bishop about whether he knew and particularly if the church sought to protect its vicar rather than our children
8069143 if you are a preacher of grace then preach a true and not a fictitious grace if grace is true you must bear a true and not a fictitious sin
8069144 thank you but we will not be coming to england
8069145 if the trumpet does not sound a clear call who will get ready for battle
8069146 as i look around not only my own diocese but also the larger church of england i see many clergy and laity who are not from an evangelical stable but who are cheerfully preaching the gospel
8069147 i see many clergy and laity cheerfully preaching the gospel
8069148 i see many clergy and laity quietly getting on with the job as they understand it without challenging the authority of the institution
8069149 the restrictive nature of the planning and the sharp reaction of some conservative evangelicals to the appointment of rowan williams as archbishop of canterbury
8069150 go back to the old paths put your commitment to evangelicalism and evangelicals above your commitment to the church of england and you will benefit the church of england more than by trying to do things the other way round

8069356 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
8069357 calling the crowd to join his disciples jesus said anyone who intends to come with me has to let me lead

8069359 when moses sent them off to scout out canaan he said
8069360 we went to the land to which you sent us and oh it does flow with milk and honey just look at this fruit the only thing is that the people who live there are fierce their cities are huge and well fortified worse yet we saw descendants of the giant anak amalekites are spread out in the negev hittites jebusites and amorites hold the hill country and the canaanites are established on the mediterranean sea and along the jordan
8069361 lets go up and take the land now we can do it
8069362 we cant attack those people theyre way stronger than we are
8069363 we scouted out the land from one end to the a land that swallows people whole everybody we saw was huge why we even saw the nephilim giants the anak giants come from the nephilim alongside them we felt like grasshoppers and they looked down on us as if we were grasshoppers
8069364 in order to prevent obesity we also have to deal with family behavior
8069365 rather than saying you have a problem and you need to do something about it the focus should be that we have a problem and the whole family should do something about it
8069366 it is not an accident that if you try to improve self esteem body image will improve and vice versa
8069367 remember kids pick up the negative connotation that most of society has about weight
8069368 we are asking for quite a commitment from parents and some significant lifestyle changes on their part
8069369 we tell them it is not fair to eat mcdonalds while saying your child cant
8069370 dont focus on the childs weight but say something like i think we could be eating healthier
8069371 as a family plan weekends around some form of physical activity as part of a routine
8069372 saturdays could always be set aside for a walk between mother and daughter or a family hike when you exercise as a family you are feeding social development as well as the body
8069373 when the parent takes an authoritative style toward feeding it becomes a control problem between the parent and the child
8069374 parents should decide what food is in the house and what is served at meals children should decide how much they want to eat
8069375 buy just one case of soda or one bag of chips and tell your kids when it is gone it is gone well buy more next week what you dont want is to have food in the house and then to tell kids they cant have it it will make them crazy
8069376 ive also seen many women especially white women whose childhood obesity and difficult surroundings defined their lives
8069377 there are women who think that if they lose weight and keep it off their lives will be perfect these women look for happiness in all the wrong places
8069378 every time you cross my mind i break out in exclamations of thanks to god each exclamation is a trigger to prayer i find myself praying for you with a glad heart i am so pleased that you have continued on in this with us believing and proclaiming gods message from the day you heard it right up to the present there has never been the slightest doubt in my mind that the god who started this great work in you would keep at it and bring it to a flourishing finish on the very day christ jesus appears

8069388 these grades communicate to the public how well a school is performing relative to state standards
8069389 the fcat is probably the most misused test in the country
8069390 the d this year is an embarrassment to the school
8069391 the fcat has gotten out of control it is intimidating for students teachers and parents
8069392 without the five basic components of reading phonics vocabulary comprehension fluency and phonological awareness the student does not have a chance
8069393 the makers of the fcat test say that you should never use a test as the sole factor to make high stakes decisions about students teachers and schools
8069394 you have to be careful because theres a line between graffiti and vandalism
8069395 it can be very good for the school but you have to be careful that the kids dont misunderstand where the line is between a planned mural and individuals going out and putting their tags around the school
8069396 but to put it on a public building without peoples permission is really not fair
8069397 it is actually a creative idea but it wouldnt help support the schools image

8069402 we believe that consumers pay attention to companies on issues like climate change when the companies themselves have made a commitment to making the world a better place and were very proud to be the beneficiary of this important effort
8069403 kiss my face and whole foods demonstrate that it is possible to both build a successful business and promote sustainability

8069481 my lady when you sent me to your father when i entered the courtyard of anu all the gods were kneeling humbled before him all the gods of the land were kneeling humbled before him the gods rose to their feet in my presence now they have come down to kurnugi
8069482 my dear namtar you should not seek ellil power nor should you you desire to do heroic deeds what come up and sit on the throne of the royal dais you perform the judgments of the broad earth should i go up to the heaven of anu my father should i eat the bread of the anunnaki should i drink the water of the anunnaki go and bring the god into my presence
8069483 let me go and my sister will have my answers only she do not make tremble my journey is clear let me go now and i will return to kurnugi later
8069484 ereshkigal your lady sent me saying i am sending you to the heaven of anu our father so let me be allowed out the message must be given to anu immediately
8069485 the son of ishtar has come back to us ereshkigal will search for him and reclaim him ea his father must sprinkle him with spring water and bareheaded blinking and cringing let him sit in the assembly of the gods

8069498 lets throw it out on the stoop and see if the cat licks it up

8069500 muito bem n o posso estar mais de acordo mas se n o se importa vou pedir uma segunda opini o
8069501 por mais que ele queira nunca poder fugir ao facto de que m dico
8069502 otherwise they would not deliver the puchased good at my premisses
8069503 this is what happens see i create this image and this is what happens
8069504 matthew mitchum i was hoping to meet him but maybe the guys are gay or married
8069505 i dont think i have much advice for marriage obviously
8069506 there you go you never know ive said that before what could happen
8069507 this is not an easy choice but this is the only chance to save peoples lives
8069508 we expect russia to live up to its international commitments reconsider this irresponsible decision and follow the approach set out in the cease fire deal
8069509 we will have to react somehow to react of course in a military way
8069510 russia is making i would say a number of irrational decisions
8069511 we hope that they hear the loud voices from the international community and understand that its not in their long term interests to take these kinds of actions
8069512 the only place these people want to be is home and they cant go home because of what has happened to them and because of the situation that the russians have caused
8069513 we obviously cant allow what russias done to go without there being some consequences
8069514 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8069515 abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognized borders of georgia and its going to remain so
8069516 georgia chose the least human way to achieve its goal to absorb south ossetia by eliminating a whole nation
8069517 short of losing our dignity as a nation we couldnt act otherwise
8069518 but russian leaders are guilty too because they kept this conflict warm for many years and tried to use it as a political instrument
8069519 its part of their belief system that this is not the right thing to do
8069520 this outbreak at least got going because it took hold in an unimmunized community so they are the ones who are really sitting ducks for infection
8069521 weve tried to do advertising to the general public about the importance of not sharing spit because thats how this thing has spread
8069522 i am not saying this because i am in need for i have learned to be content whatever the circumstances
8069523 if any of you lacks wisdom you should ask god who gives generously to all without finding fault and it will be given to you
8069524 seeing as there isnt that big of a ps3 installed base in japan i dont know how big of a coup that is for us
8069525 i think that just as we got a massive blip up with final fantasy
8069526 i know ffxiii will look great on ps3 and its up to microsoft to clarify this its still exclusive in japan

8069528 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8069529 at least four of the dioceses have follow up day workshops to discuss what they have learned in our seminars and we are encouraging each diocese to form preachers clubs
8069530 basically we are trying to identify a handful of people who having completed the three levels and who having understood the importance of preaching from bible passages could be trained to then develop level 1 programs in their own region of town we feel this would be really valuable rather than having an expensive central program for a new level 1 it pushes the training to a local level which we think is a good idea
8069531 we are pleased to help our sisters and brothers to improve their preaching and the langham preaching system is appreciated by everyone who is following it
8069532 im thankful that we had evangelicals from across the spectrum in attendance as well as several general secretaries from the francophone international fellowship of evangelical students ifes movement langham is getting to be well known in other countries as the general secretaries return to their campuses across africa
8069533 we have the idea to plan two review meetings this year in january and in may
8069534 we will also plan a weekend meeting for the pastors who came from outside of ouagadougou we also have the plan to create a network of groups of participants to do review of the material theyve received
8069535 there were some british missionaries who had worked in congo and had returned to england
8069536 they visited the congo again and went to a church where the preacher had attended a langham seminar they asked afterwards where he had learned to preach this way since they had never heard someone remain so close to the text of scripture i think this speaks well of the langham preaching material and does credit to john stotts lifetime commitment to expository preaching
8069537 i have a great dream for biblical christianity in africa
8069538 i want to see african christological reconstruction that will go beyond the standard pictures of the past and really speak to ordinary christians
8069539 he used to preach all over the place but now he never uses illustrations or stories that are not relevant to the text he is preaching from and he always ties his conclusion to what the text is saying
8069540 im going to tell him now i know your secret already we are asking him to train us and others in the church in what he has learned
8069541 i wanted to know how to present the word of god properly in context its own context and our context so that people can understand it and be changed
8069542 my husband who works for christian aid and cant be here is so jealous
8069543 during the past year i have preached through james in 2 months 1 timothy 1 corinthians and parts of micah and habakkuk i have just bought the africa bible commentary which will be really helpful i find i learn so much as i prepare
8069544 during the past year we also started a preachers club for our town and that has met twice and we will go on meeting and learning together
8069545 i was conscious that i had often preached out of context even though the message might have been true the supporting text was not appropriate
8069546 secondly i learned the need to stay within the text while preaching it
8069547 then thirdly i learned the discipline of preparing sermon notes seriously and not just extempore as the spirit leads
8069548 fourthly our church began to look at more theological themes like who really is god and if you do that you have to be more diligent in your study we have a fairly educated membership in my younger days i used to despise theology but suddenly i have realized through my reading of john stott and others that it is not dry and you can give people good content without being boring
8069549 i am in debt to god first and langham second
8069550 and yet at the same time as you go through the ph d you always affirm to yourself that you are a child in the world of learning and even afterwards i never feel that i am a scholar when you know how much there is that you dont know i dont feel worthy of that title there is still a very long way to go
8069551 i like to keep up my first love as a researcher and writer this is a crucial part of what i do i set aside time weekly for that i have a nice office in my home where i do that all of my children are at school or university so everybody is studying and i am studying with my family around me
8069552 i would not be as i am now without gods grace and the support of langham
8069553 equip christian leaders at the grassroots level pastors students and lay leaders who under the guidance of the holy spirit can be instrumental in the establishment and nurture of a vibrant church in this region
8069554 the only commentaries that an untrained pastor lay person or a theological student without access to a good library would go to are dated and not contextual
8069555 they tend to concentrate more on the technicalities of the text and contentious academic questions on authorship and dating rather than on contextual application to realities and issues in the south asian context
8069556 my theological involvement and articulation are grounded in my multiple identities as an indian asian christian woman living in a gloriously pluralist fabric a fabric which is also permeated by discrimination on the basis of caste class creed and gender
8069557 i am also constantly informed and influenced by the fact that i theologize from and in a context of globalization that has widened gaps economically socially and in religious terms
8069558 the opportunity that such a project affords to work with some of the best biblical scholars and theologians in this region is something that cannot be quantified i know i will gain immensely in working with all of the contributors to the sabc
8069559 the one volume sabc is a critical tool much needed for the numerous grass roots level pastors and evangelists who have had little or no formal theological education
8069560 it can be likened to giving a huge number of assembly line workers in a car manufacturing plant the appropriate tools to put the parts together to bring out a beautiful and powerful car
8069561 i am excited to think about the significance and impact this commentary will have for the church in south asia
8069562 with the indian subcontinent as the birthplace of key religious faiths of our world especially hinduism and buddhism and with india having the second largest population of muslims in the world topics such as
8069563 the dream started when i was doing my ph d as a langham scholar in manchester england
8069564 we wanted to face a whole range of challenges that come from things like our own arab christian identity the existence of the state of israel political islam which wants to marginalize christians ecumenism and church divisions orthodox catholic and protestant the identity and role of women salvation inspiration of the bible islamic or our own
8069565 it was a real challenge even just to get us arabs to work together part of our culture is that we easily disagree we had tough deadlines and of course some theological differences but we agreed a clear theological framework and worked hard
8069566 another objective was to pull together the langham scholars in the region and help them not to feel alone but to cooperate in a major project that has been a blessing for all of us
8069567 i hope this book will do for its readers what it has done for the participants in this seminar this week
8069568 it is the first of its kind in this part of the world it raises questions that we sometimes dont want to face and drives us back to the bible to search for answers and even when we dont find easy answers or dont agree what they are it keeps us asking and wrestling with important issues
8069569 women in the bible and christianity and the middle east today
8069570 for i do have something to say and a textbook like this will make so much more impact on the church than articles and leaflets
8069571 i know i am standing in a minefield and that some of the other contributions will be controversial in this part of the world too but i hope the book will lead to a greater openness in the churches to read the bible afresh i chose to get involved in the project because it really is the first of its kind and it is high time we produced some solid evangelical theology in the arabic context not just translations
8069572 it fits with all that ceoss tries to do in building a different environment
8069573 we live in the midst of a very tense situation here and this book will help to develop new leaders who have a different attitude
8069574 this book comes at a very opportune time in a region with such potential for causing world wide trouble we want to help christians have the courage to develop positive programmes that build up society to work with the rest of our society and yet keep their christian faith and identity very clear
8069575 our whole hope for a reference book like this is to create a debate to open arab christians to the challenges around them and to strengthen the churchs spiritual life
8069576 but this book is not limited to the church alone
8069577 we also hope that we can produce an english translation to make it available in the west
8069578 i find some american and british christians are astonished they dont know that there are so many christians in egypt and the middle east and they are your brothers and sisters a solid community
8069579 without the support of langham partnership and the help of god
8069580 i was also pleased to see the most influential writer and biblical scholar in the maronite catholic church of lebanon and perhaps in the whole middle east father dr boulos feghali
8069581 even father feghali who was not scheduled to speak insisted to say a few words on the importance of my work
8069582 allow me to thank you for yesterdays classy signing event i liked all of its parts especially your word may the lord bless you and keep your pen running for his glory
8069583 we find that expository preaching allows us to give more to the people
8069584 i see it as a way for me to get more from the bible than i did before
8069585 now i find that preparing my sermon is so much easier than before
8069586 it used to be very tough for me but now it flows so much more easily as i can think more systematically about the text
8069587 i act as the coordinator and that way they all can have a turn
8069588 but i want to expand it upwards to a diocesan level this year
8069589 i have known the author since his childhood playing with our children and we loved him like them he is now a colleague in the ministry dedicating his life to serve christ the church and people i read the manuscript of this book with passion the book deals with an old new issue that focuses on the importance unimportance of the old testament in the life of the church and the christian faith this outstanding book emphasizes the importance of the old testament as a book revealed by god for the life of the church it also deals with the strong relationship between the old testament and the new this book fulfills a significant need in the life of church and society as it helps the reader to understand and accept the old testament and to see its crucial role in understating the new testament it is with great pleasure that i recommend the publishing of this book and advice that it should be read deeply and carefully
8069590 this book represents a great academic and reference value to be added to our arabic christian library revd dr riad kassis is an example of a believing christian scholar who on the one hand has a distinguished academic wealth and on the other hand carries the burdens of his fellow arab christians these arab christians were overwhelmed with various difficulties to understand the old testament they were also subject to illegitimate interpretations of the old testament that mixed up the message of the old testament with the complexities of the political situation all this have contributed to widen the gap between the arab reader and the text of the old testament and to build a strong wall at the edge of the gap in this interesting book dr kassis attempts to build bridges of reconciliation between the reader and the text of the old testament that was regarded by the church throughout the centuries as an integral part of its holy heritage revealed by god have dr kassis succeeded to build the bridges i would like to invite the readers to accompany our writer in this journey to enjoy bridging the gap and to be able to see what is behind the wall
8069591 this is an interesting deep and documented book it deals with dilemmas and questions that an arab particularly the christian who is committed to his her faith and to the issues of his her country faces as he she reads the old testament although i do not agree fully with dr kassiss perspective on the text i do find the book to be helpful to the reader to have his her own conviction in understanding the old testament based on sound hermeneutical foundations that builds up his her spiritual life
8069592 this is not an easy choice but it is the only way to save the lives of people
8069593 you grew up here so its not spectacular to you its just normal
8069594 yeah and have you ever noticed where its beautiful theres a lot of pretty but not a lot of jobs unless you worked for the university
8069595 its like you know having dinner with three people for seven years and getting quite bored of each other
8069596 so its having a fourth person new opinion i think its gonna be interesting
8069597 kara has a good reputation of a having hits and b having an opinion and thats a good combination
8069598 concerned about the audience and acceptance time will tell well see
8069599 i know kara and she speaks her mind so she will be speaking her mind
8069600 i wore pajamas the girls wore negligees and we kind of broke the ice
8069601 just had your pedicure night out with the girls and a few bottles of decent red wine
8069602 curl up on the couch in your pjs and watch lifetime with a box of kleenex and a mug of hot tea
8069603 you must have misunderstood me i said that i could neither confirm nor deny that we were seeking to represent that client i simply asked you to clarify what client you were talking about so i could try and track it down for you i also said explicitly that we do not comment on clients or potential clients if there is any confusion on this point you are welcome to call me on my cell
8069604 id love to be more helpful to you but i cant
8069605 right now wall street traders are raising gas prices with nothing more than the click of a mouse without regard for anything but their own profits traders are bidding up prices by buying huge quantities of oil just to sell them at an even higher price this bill will address the rising cost of gasoline in the short term prevent wall street traders from gaming the oil markets and ensure that american consumers are paying a fair price at the pump
8069606 if you didnt know how many homes you have no wonder you think the economy is sound
8069607 he is out of touch i dont think he realizes what ordinary americans are going through i dont think the bush administration realizes what ordinary americans are going through
8069608 as soon as the shows over shes right back to bein my soldier cause mamis
8069609 until carter ruck and partners and englands stifling libel laws got to work the few american journalists not caught up in obama mania were turning to the archives of the british press to answer an intriguing question who is nadhmi auchi
8069610 a libel claimant does not have to prove that the words are false or to prove that he has in fact suffered any loss damage is presumed
8069611 as far as he can remember he has had no direct contact with mr obama
8069612 this is not an easy choice but this is the only chance to save peoples lives
8069613 we expect russia to live up to its international commitments reconsider this irresponsible decision and follow the approach set out in the cease fire deal
8069614 we will have to react somehow to react of course in a military way
8069615 russia is making i would say a number of irrational decisions
8069616 we hope that they hear the loud voices from the international community and understand that its not in their long term interests to take these kinds of actions
8069617 the only place these people want to be is home and they cant go home because of what has happened to them and because of the situation that the russians have caused
8069618 we obviously cant allow what russias done to go without there being some consequences
8069619 the law recognizes a difference between a true threat one that can be carried out and the reported racist rantings of a drug addict
8069620 a bunch of meth heads get together we dont know why they do what they do people do lots of stupid things on meth
8069621 if youre talking about a true threat there has to be some evidence theyre not just talking about it or thinking about it especially in a drug induced state
8069622 i think that its something that at times the media tried to make more of
8069623 weve always watched them as we watch all the other groups
8069624 the capability and their opportunity and what they had for their weaponry i dont see that they would have been able to carry it out
8069625 lt td gt r n t t first name teachers
8069626 hillary isnt trying to outdo obama shes trying to outdo biden
8069627 there was insufficient evidence that the statements of the suspects constituted a true threat
8069628 were showing the people of denver what occupations looks like
8069629 the idea behind this is that the first casualty of the war is the troops
8069630 were bringing home to denver what the occupation looks like
8069631 the first casualty of war is the truth bring the troops home now
8069632 in order to survive daily missions soldiers are taught to use brutal dehumanizing search and seizure tactics
8069633 its just crowded if i could have taken vacation during the democratic national convention i would have
8069634 were trying to bring a taste of what an occupied city feels like
8069635 were here mainly to show some of the stuff we experienced in iraq
8069636 i sholom keller do solemnly swear to support and defend the constitution of the united states of america against all enemies foreign and domestic and to bear true faith and allegiance to the same
8069637 i wanted to dedicate my life to a cause greater than myself
8069638 i had a real sense of pride in being an american i wanted to give back to my country
8069639 i didnt take an oath to wage war against whomever the president decides to fight
8069640 i took an oath to defend the constitution and with it the nation and the people and the oath didnt expire when i got out of the army
8069641 they get goodwill they get access and they build relationships
8069642 theyre covering all bases theyre making sure they have input with whoever wins
8069643 im sure mr hoyer didnt even know who the sponsor was
8069644 we want to show our appreciation for our open beta testers by making sure they have a truly enjoyable and unique experience
8069645 the la tale open beta will be a highly active period with tons of things going on
8069646 trick out your bird of prey with green flame decals to show off when i decloak to pwn federation nubs
8069647 terror has seized you the fear of defeat seizes your heart often causing you to cower
8069648 dread your heart is heavy in the face of such evil
8069649 lets remind everyone this is a video game and not a hockey simulation
8069650 os clinton sempre trabalharam pelos latinos eles come aram sua carreira pol tica em um com cio no texas foi l onde eles se conheceram e se apaixonaram
8069651 sempre que n s latinos precisamos de algo bill e hillary estiveram l para nos ajudar por isso os hisp nicos os v em como nosso casal kennedy como jacqueline e john
8069652 para mim essa vota o muito importante porque representa a chance de darmos todo nosso respeito e reconhecimento ao que hillary conseguiu no processo das prim rias
8069653 hillary quer que demos nosso apoio a obama e biden e com pesar farei isso mas porque ela me pede

8069770 locally stores wind energy using a hydraulic accumulator in conventional high pressure pipeline storage banks enabling its use as on demand peak power
8069771 if you choose your components correctly it turns out its possible to store as much as a few hours worth of energy at the side of the turbines how we do that i would leave as a secret for a little while but the notion is that in the end all of what were using are elements of technology already commonly found in alberta its not like weve discovered some new vanadium cell or some speculative thing its a case of using good engineering principles and novel integration
8069772 when you start looking at how much money you spend on the means of energy production versus how much money you spend on storage and how you allocate your capital ratios that interplay lets you effectively put most of the grid on renewable energy

8069779 they are saying that the roman catholic church is now more hospitable to confessional lutheran teaching than the church in which they were baptized and confirmed
8069780 the single best predictor of church participation turned out to be belief orthodox christian belief and especially the teaching that a person can be saved only through jesus christ amazingly enough fully 68 of those who are still active presbyterians dont believe it

8069782 this is the first step to getting out of the drought situation we are in
8069783 while its good to see the rain it doesnt mean that it will get the river up to where we need to be to leave mandatory restrictions
8069784 the mills river long term flow is dependent on ground water
8069785 theres a good prospect for rain over the course of the next couple of days
8069786 rainfall should be rather substantial across the mountains in your area the potential exists up across the hendersonville asheville area for 4 to 6 inches of rain by thursday morning
8069787 this rain is an encouraging first step toward getting out of the drought and off mandatory water restrictions
8069788 the one good aspect of the rain is that lawns are getting water and plants are getting watered
8069789 the water restrictions will remain in place until we advise otherwise
8069790 the decision to come out of mandatory restrictions depends on the sustained levels of the mills river
8069791 mondays rain could increase the flow to 40 or 50 cubic feet per second but then it could drop back down rapidly after the rain before mondays rain the river has been at the lowest level since the drought with levels hovering right at 19 cubic feet per second

8069837 this is a huge victory for bowhunting not only in virginia but quite likely nationwide the virginia supreme court reinforces four critical points that form the foundation of bowhunting in america first bowhunting in urban areas can be done safely without putting people or property at risk second individual property owners can use bowhunting to address deer damage and nuisance problems third wildlife is a public resource thats held in trust and managed by states in this case the virginia department of game and inland fisheries for the publics benefit and four individuals or a homeowners associations cannot usurp state authority or use the courts to shut down or interfere with a legitimate bowhunting program when people or groups violate these historical well established lines of authority and take actions based on personal opinions its going to cost them
8069838 were extremely gratified to win a ruling of such high stature this should set a strong precedent in virginia and elsewhere virginias long standing approach to urban deer depredation problems is to use bowhunting whenever possible bowhunters in reston were part of that solution and had a proven track record unfortunately the homeowners association went ahead and created their covenant even after they were advised they were exceeding their authority the facts were against them from the start maybe now theyve learned they cant make laws just because they dont like bowhunting just as importantly when local groups force bowhunters to go to the courts to restore our rights its going to cost them

8069918 that was no easy choice to make but it is the sole chance of saving peoples lives
8069919 the most important thing was to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe to save the lives of people for whom we are responsible because most of them they are russian citizens

8069929 as we transfer control to the iraqis the addition of renewable and self sustainable energy at the outlying bases will enable the iraqis to operate independently lessening the need for coalition forces to provide future logistics support
8069930 this is the beginning of the people trying to understand that the whole notion of energy means being more effective in operations
8069931 70 of the tonnage delivered to deployed forces is fuel fuel delivery convoys to deployed forces add costs to the logistical chain and create targets for ieds the single greatest source of casualties in iraq additional personnel protection measures to reduce casualties from ieds such as air cover or air transport substitutions for ground convoys increase costs further

8069933 comparison of the true costs capital costs maintenance fuel fuel logistics etc of a 10 kilowatt diesel generator shows that a skybuilt power mps solar battery system can cut those costs by at least 75 while improving reliability saving manpower and spare parts reducing or eliminating fuel costs handling and logistics and providing a low heat signature the up front capital costs of a 10 kilowatt diesel generator are around 7 500 10 000 much less than a mps around 100 000 depending on the configuration but after only three to five years these costs are recovered

8069950 but if something emergent happens then sometimes you have to drop what you are doing
8069951 the first thing we do is vet out any possible threat to public safety or anything that could possibly put anybody in imminent threat or imminent danger
8069952 in the big scheme of things we have to run down every single lead to make sure that it is resolved
8069953 all the tips that come in are reviewed by fbi personnel only a handful of those every day actually have some nexus to terrorism so that we can actually drill down on those further
8069954 if we get a name what the intelligence analysts are doing is theyre looking for other connections
8069955 theyre contacting their other u s intelligence community counterparts theyre doing database scrubs theyre getting additional information while operational specialists and our agents out in the field are attending to the immediate case needs
8069956 what were seeing in kevins case is proof that the serious injury recovery rate in pro football is nowhere near as serious as people have come to believe
8069957 not only will kevin be able to walk out of the hospital he actually wont have to as he will heal so completely that he will be better than he was before and will almost certainly be able to fly out unassisted
8069958 i dont think id be exaggerating kevins prognosis if i said were looking at a 200 recovery here
8069959 while its true i have treated few players with kevins level of physical conditioning and mental resilience i dont think its fair for the nfls doctor to tell him that hell be able to fly
8069960 first of all the trauma to his spinal cord was so extreme that we had to inject chilled saline into his body to induce healing second no matter what dr homburg says people cannot just grow wings and fly period and to tell kevin that is cruel he probably wont even play football again
8069961 sadly im afraid its true that kevin will never play football again the league cannot afford to give the bills the sort of unfair competitive advantage a flying tight end would offer them
8069962 its a lot like how steve young and troy aikman had to retire when their concussions gave them telekinesis and the power to stop time still for castillo to just dismiss the idea of kevins more than complete recovery out of hand is cynical and unprofessional like many injury related issues while it may be based on sound medical practices it goes against everything the nfl is about
8069963 also i should make it clear that im not saying kevin will actually just grow wings and fly
8069964 it could be from magic a rare form of spinal helicopter blades or small jet boosters emerging from his feet we have to keep an open mind about this
8069965 i think everyone understands that in the 2001 time frame the whole market corrected because of the internet bubble and power one is one of the stocks that got hit hard
8069966 i think they were stretching in their research but so be it
8069967 an entrenched ceo perceives himself as immune from discipline by his board and is uninterested in maintaining or improving his performance to attract outside offers
8069968 it is shockingly large in terms of what you see in financial research
