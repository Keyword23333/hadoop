6690085 survey work confirms our earlier estimate that over 1 000 000 iraqi citizens have died as a result of the conflict which started in 2003 we now estimate that the death toll between march 2003 and august 2007 is likely to have been of the order of 1 033 000 if one takes into account the margin of error associated with survey data of this nature then the estimated range is between 946 000 and 1 120 000

6690374 all the lawyers that i had talked to they tell me you dont have a chance in this thing they just will not give you exemption so im very happy that they have given me exemption
6690375 we were trying to use the sensible approach to this thing and look at and try to figure out what a reasonable person would do
6690376 by drafting him in the first round portland has the right to hold onto his rights even if they dont feel he is ready for the nba
6690377 when we investigated trades the blazers say that they like petteri as a player and dont want to give up on him so our hands our tied somewhat with what we can do in the nba and portland i think wants to have its cake and eat it too this way petteri can continue to develop and they dont have to give up a roster spot
6690378 the risk for portland is that if petteri has a bad year or gets hurt obviously they wont bring him over
6690379 petteris ultimate goal remains to play in the nba but hes in a very good situation with an excellent contract playing in a beautiful place for a team with a proud history that is committed to winning and has basketball crazy fans
6690380 the story of my summer has been the same every time in every case the players decided to sign where they felt they were the most wanted
6690381 if i could get on my soapbox for a minute i would say that the one lesson of this summer for nba teams is to put a little bit more effort into wooing players the rate of exchange between the euro and the dollar is not something we can change for the next few years the cba cant change but at the moment the story is that players who are deciding between the nba and overseas are not in the cases we have heard about being wooed much by the nba team if teams do things to make players feel wanted like the kings did last summer with beno udrih when they made him feel beyond wanted it goes a long way everyone in every line of work wants to feel wanted
6690382 i have been starbucking for 3 1 2 months solid

6690389 they were getting close to the end of their tour the rotos troop rotation were going to starting coming back in the next month or a bit something like this really just kind of sends a pall over the place
6690390 its just not socially acceptable anymore to the degree it was two decades ago to get behind the wheel of a car after drinking
6690391 this isnt something that is dropping off the table and were shifting our focus
6690392 the police opp ontario provincial police and community city forces are as determined as ever and the laws are as tough as ever
6690393 what were seeing is a bit of a belated catch up in canada to the surge in global food prices we saw earlier this year
6690394 because even with the pullback in grain prices theyre still well up from a year ago
6690395 some of that strength in grain prices earlier this year was for real
6690396 partly its just a matter of food companies making sure that its not just a fluke thats going to be quickly reversed
6690397 grain prices make up only a small share about two per cent of the actual final food price
6690398 unfortunately canadians are going to be experiencing continued pressure on food prices in the future

6690401 mengapa ketika seseorang sedang dalam keadaan marah ia akan berbicara dengan suara kuat atau berteriak
6690402 karena saat seperti itu ia telah kehilangan kesabaran karena itu ia lalu berteriak
6690403 lawan bicaranya justru berada disampingnya mengapa harus berteriak apakah ia tak dapat berbicara secara halus
6690404 ketika dua orang sedang berada dalam situasi kemarahan jarak antara ke dua hati mereka menjadi amat jauh walau secara fisik mereka begitu dekat karena itu untuk mencapai jarak yang demikian mereka harus berteriak namun anehnya semakin keras mereka berteriak semakin pula mereka menjadi marah dan dengan sendirinya jarak hati yang ada di antara keduanya pun menjadi lebih jauh lagi karena itu mereka terpaksa berteriak lebih keras lagi
6690405 sebaliknya apa yang terjadi ketika dua orang saling jatuh cinta mereka tak hanya tidak berteriak namun ketika mereka berbicara suara yang keluar dari mulut mereka begitu halus dan kecil sehalus apapun keduanya bisa mendengarkannya dengan begitu jelas mengapa demikian
6690406 karena hati mereka begitu dekat hati mereka tak berjarak pada akhirnya sepatah katapun tak perlu diucapkan sebuah pandangan mata saja amatlah cukup membuat mereka memahami apa yang ingin mereka sampaikan

6690414 our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic avian flu has already been created through genetic engineering in the united states fusing the deadly genome of the 1918 pandemic misnamed the spanish flu with the dna of the innocuous h5n1 virus in a growth medium of human kidney cells according to the national institutes of health and the vaccines manufacturer some virologists believe that this would insure that the man made mutant virus recognizes human cells and knows how to invade them

6690418 almost everyday there are news segments on the economy and a looming recession unemployment rates are at record highs and everyone around the country is feeling the effects of the poor economy some families are even struggling to meet basic living expenses such as food and transportation and therefore cant repay their owed back taxes these families are ideal candidates for what is known as placement on the irs currently not collectible status
6690419 each client owed on average approximately 48 000 00 with the highest single tax liability being nearly 480 000 00 most of the clients cases were successfully concluded within one year but it is important to remember that the amount of time it takes to negotiate a settlement with the irs depends on a variety of factors including how quickly the taxpayer can provide financial documents requested by the irs
6690420 i strongly encourage taxpayers struggling with irs back taxes to call my law firm
6690421 sometimes people do not realize that they have options the irs is willing to negotiate and even cease collections if you show them you cannot afford to fully repay your tax liability the lawyers at my law firm are skilled at negotiating with the irs and know how to get taxpayers the resolutions they deserve
6690422 global companies are embracing succession planning as part of their overall talent management strategies with great enthusiasm in fact it is becoming a top priority for those looking to accelerate and extend their growth
6690423 as we all know employee turnover within organizations does occur but easy to use technology is available for organizations to proactively respond by not putting the mechanisms and tools in place future leaders cannot be identified and the impact of the business can be disastrous at successfactors we advise our clients to first take inventory of their talent and routinely re visit the process to ensure succession decisions are based on clear accurate up to date data this ensures a higher degree of success
6690424 thanks to the efforts of all staff and continuous development of our services we have experienced a great deal of success in the id verification sector with our smart id plus anti money laundering service performing strongly in legal and financial markets we have also secured significant unclaimed assets contracts which have proved fruitful not only in monetary value but also from a promotional perspective as we have received a high volume of exposure in the national press and online whilst we look set to smash last years growth we are already firmly focusing on the forthcoming financial year with the intention of setting another record
6690425 myself and my team have worked hard over the last year to improve and build upon our service offering we have also further developed our internal systems for ease of use and to improve efficiency together these changes have allowed us to stay ahead of our competitors by offering superior service delivery to our customers
6690426 after speaking to several users and potential users of digital pen and paper technology we realised that they were keen to share ideas success stories questions and best practice with likeminded people but had no vehicle to do so unity will provide this central point of contact in both on line and usergroup formats the on line forum found at www unityforums org is segmented into business and technology streams and private and public sectors allowing speedy access to relevant information and peers
6690427 with anoto technology so prevalent in the workplace this is a key initiative that will bring users that all have a common interest closer together and allow them to extract the very best from their investment
6690428 we see the usergroup being run by users for users meeting regularly to discuss ideas for development solutions and innovation and where they can share information to benefit both themselves and others

6690432 hospitality employees work extremely hard especially at this time of year and its fair to say the industry is rarely associated with passion or fun for us these results just confirm what we see every day that hospitality workers really do love their jobs
6690433 the levels of positive feedback for the viral ads have been incredible with many people enjoying seeing the light hearted side to the industry i hope little gordon and the latest statistics will bring a whole new much deserved reputation to the hospitality sector
6690434 i knew that there would definitely be an end to donna at the end of the series

6690440 backscatter is an unfortunate side effect of the continued prevalence of email spoofing by spam campaigns that is now plaguing corporate email servers
6690441 it is also a frustrating and sometimes confusing problem for email users who are the innocent victims
6690442 while one common technique to minimise the impact of backscatter is to simply define policies to block all incoming bounce messages doing so can result in the blocking of legitimate bounce messages
6690443 as such distinguishing legitimate from invalid bounce messages can be extremely important to users who send business critical email
6690444 beyond the reputation benefits of preventing spam and viruses from leaving an organisations network invalid bounce suppression has a direct impact on reducing the amount of unwanted email that hits users email inboxes
6690445 invalid bounce suppression provides another compelling reason why organisations should also consider relaying their outbound email through an email security solution such as the barracuda spam firewall or barracuda spam firewall outbound
6690446 i consider this as a great moment i am not talking about the commercial viability of the film as an actor i gained lot of things after doing this film even portraying the role of albert samson i started learning about human minds its entirely about a mans lust love sex greediness but he doesnt consider this as something gray in his life thats the combination of this man thats the chemistry

6690454 buyplexus com is unique because it benefits both the shopper and business owner
6690455 shoppers have a place to find the products or services theyre interested in and merchants can utilize the sites marketing tools to generate additional exposure in the search engines and social media networks weve created a powerful shopping portal in buyplexus com thats capable of rivaling some of the most popular online
6690456 the free business directory promotion is designed to allow more users to experience the benefits of the network and build a significant advertiser base weve had a great response so far
6690457 since buyplexus com was built with the new web 2 0 marketing standards in mind we were able to augment the listings with additional components like business blogs rss feeds google maps photo galleries reviews comments and social media functionality
6690458 our designers and developers knew savvy marketers would appreciate these extra features and they did a great job integrating them into the site
6690459 the goal with buyplexus is to enable anyone to post and search products and services not just business owners
6690460 many competitors simply dont allow people to take advantage of a networks popularity without paying high fees or having an established business so we made sure buyplexus was accessible to everyone and didnt exclude those users
6690461 we hope the launch of buyplexus com shows our continued commitment to being a resource for everyone not just our clients
6690462 in terms of advertising a business we know the best approach to marketing is a comprehensive one so buyplexus certainly meets that need by providing so many options
6690463 this regulation is not about contraception its about abortion and conscience
6690464 this lack of knowledge of provider conscience law within the health professions can be detrimental to conscience and other rights particularly for individuals and entities with moral objections to abortion and other medical procedures
6690465 the proposed regulations and secretary leavitts public comments about them leave the door open as to whether institutions and individuals can deny access to contraception
6690466 while the rules are not identical to the draft proposal being circulated by hhs last month the agency interprets existing conscientious objection laws so broadly that it could result in women not receiving information they need to make informed healthcare decisions
6690467 it undermines the doctor patient relationship because women will now have to question whether their health care providers are giving them complete and unbiased information and the best care possible
6690468 t he issue i asked to be addressed in this regulation is not abortion or contraceptives but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience and patients should be able to choose a doctor who has beliefs like his or hers the department is still contemplating if it will issue a regulation or not if it does it will be directly focused on the protection of practitioner conscience
6690469 is the fear here that so many doctors will refuse that it will somehow make it difficult for a woman to get an abortion that hasnt happened but what if it did wouldnt that be an important and legitimate social statement
6690470 our research shows that temporary employees are becoming reformed job hoppers and ditching the once common trend of switching jobs whenever they got fed up with a company because there was a buoyant economy and jobs in plentiful supply with the current economic gloom workers are now clinging onto their jobs for fear that they may struggle to find another one
6690471 in recent months the recruitment sector has been thriving with more and more people coming to agencies looking for work but it now looks as though demand is far outweighing the number of jobs available
6690472 we cant come to terms with what weve gone through
6690473 it feels unreal within a day my wife and i show up at the hospital our daughter is born and declared dead later we find out she is still alive and a few hours later we are told again that she is dead
6690474 i showed up at the intensive care unit and saw that she was dead my wife will suffer from this and well have to deal with it im sure shell need psychological help
6690475 once the games are complete we will be conducting a comprehensive review of all our programmes
6690476 i like all fans of team usa am extremely disappointed with the performance of our relays
6690477 the way in which we select train and coach our relays
6690478 these are professional athletes who are the best in their field and anybody who ever ran a high school relay cringes when that baton hits the track
6690479 they jamaica brought their a game i dont know where we left ours
6690480 being quiet or not disclosing full details would only promote ignorance and a false sense of security among the general populace but it still provides full understanding to the adversary who is considerably more knowledgeable
6690481 remaining silent also gives developers an excuse not to implement what is at the end of the day a very simple fix i pity them because i dont like being forced to do work or spend money either but those are the breaks
6690482 i firmly believe that human readable program code very much qualifies as speech and should be protected at all costs even if it is exploit code or instruction that causes people in power some inconvenience
6690483 cios have to align it with their corporate strategy to get higher returns
6690484 genuinely publicly devoted to a product or service even if they dont quite embody the values that the brands managers may be trying to convey
6690485 but it certainly could have a very subliminal effect it could degrade the brand
6690486 it only draws more attention to the association if they acknowledge it
6690487 that was a huge mistake an incredibly short sighted mistake

6690546 the track record of winners to losers is not that impressive
6690547 many unstable countries change their currency every few years to help control runaway inflation and often to curb corruption the african country ghana just looped off three zeros in their currency this was done more to help control the rampant illegal diamond business in that country than to help inflation there was an estimated 25 percent of the currency in criminal hands outside the countrys banking system the turn in period was short only 60 days and the customer turning in old currency had to have an existing bank account
6690548 when the ruble became an international currency the first thing the russian government did was print new currency and give only 90 days to turn in old currency to convert to new currency
6690549 they also put a temporary freeze on new bank accounts being opened during the turn in period this left all the tens of millions of rubles outside russia as worthless a successful investor made several thousand percent in just the first year
6690550 today investors are interested in the chinese yuan the vietnamese dong and the iraqi dinar to name a few
6690551 the lesson learned is to make sure you comply with the issuing countries laws on their currency and business
6690552 to safely invest in any of these countries you need a state approved business license
6690553 because we do licensing in iraq we do make it easier to do business there where licensing has gone up dramatically for foreign companies often times it is better to wait until the currency actually makes it to the international market before investing or doing business
6690554 we are giving away more than 300 000 in cash and prizes through our play and win sweepstakes you can enter daily for a chance to win the grand prize of 100 000 in our cash sweepstakes in addition there are more than 4 000 prizes worth over 200 000 in our instant win game

6690556 lecturers are faced with the challenge of creating a massive volume of materials for their courses in a very short period of time
6690557 they only have a few weeks each semester in which to create an entire course curriculum complete with lecture notes class materials and student exercises this is a very intensive task for which there are very few aids in the market by releasing a free 7 day trial of the educational version of mpmm we can help lecturers to gain all of the materials they need to perform this task quickly and easily the materials are structured so that each project management topic is described separately in depth so a lecturer can pick up the materials and use them to plan their courses much more easily
6690558 the educational version also helps students to pass their courses it gives them all of the materials they need to study the project management topic to an advanced level they can start with a summary of the steps taken to deliver a project and then move on to more advanced topics such as risk management project planning and project execution
6690559 attention everyone we will be closing in about ten minutes at 7 00 oclock
6690560 well what i would need in order to help you is a police report documenting the crime and a full description of the items after we have a description we can look out for anything suspicious that comes in
6690561 i havent been able to file a police report because fed ex is being really difficult and not wanting to get in trouble
6690562 um can you fax or e mail me a description of the items then
6690563 let me just put you on hold and i will have someone take down a description of the items okay
6690564 you know sometimes stuff just gets stolen thats just what happens
6690565 you americans are so spoiled you dont know how good you have it there
6690566 there is a sadness in the american personality because we are never satisfied
6690567 and cubans are not enamored with american visitors we dont impress them with our apparent wealth i told luis that when i look into their faces i see my best self the accumulation of stuff has nothing to do about being happy their dignity in the face of impoverished circumstances is very moving
6690568 no one ever questioned us about our activity except one time when we were filming kamar playing drunk being soaked by waves crashing over the famous malecon seawall
6690569 heres the deal cubans that we met dont have a problem with america our country has the problem with cuba and when we returned from havana to new jersey and went through customs our camera was inspected and the person carrying it was interrogated when our guy said that we had shot film at the film festival we got all our equipment and tapes through
6690570 violations of regulations may result in civil and or criminal penalties
6690571 it was a piece of life that moved me as believable as a documentary incredible as a film made from stolen shots insightful to see what cuba is really like amazing to hear cuban people speak their own wisdom havent seen anything quite like it natural acting and beautiful images of cuba i have to go to havana now
6690572 the local conversations the lingo they did a tremendous job the character alberto is everybodys friend everybody from havana knows an alberto this film captured the pride and dignity of our people politics aside we saw the real cuba
6690573 i want mommy to see it it is that important they hit a home run when they made that film
6690574 ive got to tell you this guy has got chops ive been acting for thirty years and worked with the best luis is a natural i know that cuban guy he portrayed on the streets of havana it was amazing to see luis move so naturally in that role i was shocked and stunned the character was so right on so typical and i asked him how he was able to do it he left cuba as a five year old how he told me we are what we are its in our blood this film really deserves attention for the risks that the filmmakers took and for the realistic views of cuba that they have brought to the screen they have given us a message of hope on many levels it makes me want to return to my own roots in cuba
6690575 we found ourselves literally competing with major studios but we were able to put our first film into theatres a task that was daunting ask my kids
6690576 as a person who has wanted to tell a story in cuba since forever i was going to make happen no matter what i was born in cuba and it was my family home until the age of five the moment anne b real was accepted into the havana film festival i just knew that my opportunity had come from the beginning i knew that our film would be a story about reuniting with a father i myself was a child of divorce and i did not want to get that phone call telling me that my estranged father had died
6690577 i wanted to go for it live to go for the gold the process was very moving for everyone who witnessed it luck gets the credit for the moment but we were prepared for the luck
6690578 my proudest moments were when people in havana consistently thought that i was from havana i am after all a trained actor but the first thing that i had to do was to let go of english
6690579 you cant educate and try to suppress at the same time
6690580 i dont know why a person would want to take their life perhaps they are trying to escape from themselves to get away from their own voices hiding from uncomfortable thoughts voices waiting to explode in their silence either dead or alive they have to rest they have to listen and liberate their soul from their minds
6690581 ive seen the free world through the eyes of many tourists when i first met tom s i started to realize the truth no one is completely free
6690582 i love how the waves never give up like a mothers heart they hug you with everything they have but some people resist they ignore those hearts afraid of knowing the silence of the sea
6690583 very few are the souls that are truly free perhaps its regret that holds us back and forgiveness is the key that opens the door to freedom in the moment some choose between love and suicide
6690584 but my attention was on how people felt about the film my intention was that audiences come into the theatre one way and leave transformed if you get the message of the movie at the very least you should call one of your parents
6690585 call ten people and tell them that they should see this movie this movie was filmed in cuba by cubans who asked no one for permission to make it why should we have to get any governments permission to be artists
6690586 it was bittersweet my father had told me about his heydays in havana my heart was pounding and when i met the daughter of my fathers best friend my heart at that point dropped into my stomach she told me things about my father that i did not know things that frankly i did not know my father was capable of when my father left cuba he gave his best friend his house without that gift they would not have had a home that blew me away it immediately gave me a new perspective of who my father was as a man a human being the hard edged man that i grew up knowing was actually someone who was extremely sensitive and full of heart and life and soul for the first time in my life i started to see me in him and him in me when i walked through those doors i became my fathers son
6690587 i give luis all the credit in the world for making the movie and for his acting
6690588 luis fell into the character of alberto effortlessly it was seamless and beautiful to watch this movie is a heartfelt journey for everyone who sees it it relates to women too who have to deal with the men in their lives who are not at peace with themselves women always have a stake in the outcomes of relationships between fathers and sons
6690589 we worked very long hours and it became clear that we were in search of a film that changed with our daily circumstances i did my own hair makeup and wardrobe and my best heels fell apart from shooting in the rain
6690590 we offer parents a place where they can purchase original fine art and limited edition prints so you are not just decorating you are purchasing an heirloom and maybe even raising a little art collector of your own
6690591 aufnehmen beobachten und fragen fragen fragen das ist zu beginn das wichtigste
6690592 i think its pretty important for this crew as far as looking to take a step up or a step forward
6690593 so far throughout the season i think we have made progression and improved
6690594 obviously we were pretty disappointed as a group how we went in auckland so for us its a good opportunity to prove to ourselves and obviously to everyone else that we have taken a step forward
6690595 im very hopeful we can show that we can do that
6690596 i think thats a good thing theres a lot less baggage amongst this crew at the moment
6690597 we possibly saw that in our first match against the all blacks a 34 19 win a while back and hopefully we can see that over the next few matches
6690598 when someones talking youre getting a lot of eyes directed straight at you and intensity as far as contests at training
6690599 thats a good thing and weve just got the positive mindset to put ourselves under as much pressure as you can at training and to execute under those pressures
6690600 theyre a side that have the world champion tag so theres still an underlying confidence with that
6690601 it wasnt too long back when they secured that amazing 32 30 victory in dunedin
6690602 i think south africa are an extremely proud nation and especially at home we are expecting a significant battle in front of us on saturday
6690603 when you play at even newlands and especially at joburg and pretoria those venues theyre on top of you and its like a cauldron and the crowd can be at times quite hostile
6690604 whereas at kings park absa stadium theres still a massive crowd but they dont feel as though theyre suffocating you
6690605 it was a long time ago and ive got great memories about that whole trip that whole era really
6690606 so now its hopefully time to implant some new ones
6690607 why did the vietnamese shoot down john mccain and put him in prison for five years he seems like such a nice guy
6690608 their expectations are pretty high but really they werent on the pitch at all its very difficult i dont know what to say
6690609 its been a massive experience for me something that i never saw coming
6690610 obviously i have to take a hard look at myself i cant stomach having that many losses i have to look at myself and my own coaching obviously it wasnt there for this tournament and maybe its not there at all
6690611 players that have been playing really well are missing traps holding on to the ball a fraction long and not moving it on our games based around moving the ball on and when you dont have that its not that much of a competition
6690612 i think gemma flynn has been a great find and it was good to see kayla sharland come through at the end lizzie igasan has had a very good tournament too
6690613 to yourself or imagine putting a stop sign in front of your negative thought

6690617 theyre going to focus on people looking for something to buy
6690618 they had to limit their scope and this is where theyre going to start
6690619 if users are frustrated with a platform theyre going to be more likely to go out and snag any update that purports to fix the problems
6690620 windows xp users were generally happy with service pack 2
6690621 there was not a huge clamor for windows xp sp3 like there was for vista sp1 and that shows in the results its pretty clear that a lot of xp users are very content with sp2
6690622 they heavily promoted vista sp1 and went out of their way to put a good foot forward for it but they barely mentioned xp sp3
6690623 no fancy equipment is required to read the data array once it is unlocked
6690624 every time you write data it might write to a different part of the disk and then change the directory table around so it forgets where the data was written before
6690625 if all the software does is write over the top of the lbas i dont think itll be as effective on an ssd as it may have missed remnants from the previous wear levelling or something like that because the software doesnt know about that
6690626 buyers with strong balance sheets are actively looking for consolidation candidates

6690628 i firmly believe this region needs a quality media brand such as the post to carry the torch for all who invest their time money and energy in making the midlands the prosperous economic and cultural powerhouse it is today just as industries change and develop and as new communities settle and grow in the midlands so too must the post change to truly serve its readership
6690629 a married teaching assistant who fell in love with a teenage pupil escaped jail yesterday because their affair stopped short of sex
6690630 we appeal to people to march to eidgah ground to remember and pay homage to martyrs

6690632 we have taken two targets this morning mi 24s helicopters attacked a line of bunkers in tunukkai in mullaitivu and fighter jets completely destroyed a ltte logistics facility in kilinochchi
6690633 i just saw the plight of people using the trains to get to work every morning they were jostling to get on board every time a train arrived there appeared to be no system
6690634 im not happy with this because the people are not getting satisfaction from riding the trains this we must fix
6690635 i found the trains really packed some had waited for three trains and yet could not board
6690636 theres no queue people push their way in women with children and old people are pushed aside

6690642 fear of the lord understanding knowledge and the life that comes from the word at least it seems this way to me what do you think
6690643 i can think of no better place to host the best the commonwealth has to offer
6690644 we have formally contacted the australian commonwealth games association to express our interest they have indicated that in the next few months they will decide whether australia will bid for the 2018 commonwealth games or future commonwealth games so i was keen to put our hand up early
6690645 we will now set up a local committee to work on our bid and to champion the cause
6690646 it will be a big challenge to secure the games but the potential pay off is enormous
6690647 it is estimated the recent 2006 commonwealth games in melbourne generated hundreds of millions for the victorian economy
6690648 more than 12 5 000 visitors came to the games and more than 13 000 jobs were created
6690649 however while these projects are significant there is no doubt more work will need to be done if we are to be successful in our bid
6690650 any money spent will be an investment for the future of this region and for our sate
6690651 nearly 10 per cent of our current olympic athletes are from the gold coast which is a testament to our sporting status
6690652 we clearly have the perfect weather for an event like this you couldnt get a better location
6690653 this is reflective of the sporting and accomodation facilities that we have and will have by 2018
6690654 it would be fantastic for south east queensland and the whole region and would bring enormous opportunities across the board
6690655 i think the only issues we would have would be coping with the infrastructure and the sheer magnitude of the games
6690656 transport is only one component financially socially and from a skills perspective there would need to be an enormous investment
6690657 organisers would also need to do a lot of research into its feasibility
6690658 there are definitely lessons to be learned and a lot of heartache that could be avoided from melbournes experience with the commonwealth games
6690659 this month aoc chief john coates indicated queensland would be the next cab off the rank when it comes to australia bidding for the olympics
6690660 it will probably be 20 or 30 years down the track but if we are successful with the commonwealth games it will certainly put in place the foundations for a successful olympics

6690697 und die gro en firmen wollen nur neue produkte au erdem ist jede firma auf einen kleinen bereich spezialisiert und auch dort braucht sie nicht viele neue ideen solange die alten noch geld abwerfen
6690698 je mehr jemand in einem gebiet spezialisiert ist desto mehr ist er auch von allen anderen isoliert
6690699 diejenigen die ein problem haben wissen nicht dass es l sbar ist und die die die l sung h tten wissen nichts von dem problem

6690716 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6690717 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6690718 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6690719 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing

6690723 it is the greatest challenge for any statesman today to see what is the right priority
6690724 is it iran russia the price of oil terrorism it may in some ways look like the cold war again but the context today is blurred past recognition
6690725 will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic means
6690726 nato is trying to make a victim of an aggressor georgia and whitewash a criminal regime
6690727 the russian federation and the united states are not about to enter a new cold war even if tensions between moscow and washington rise dramatically
6690728 the cold war pitted an ideologically driven soviet union against the free world a conflict where both sides devoted enormous resources to defeat the other
6690729 an ideologically driven notion that the only possible choices these two countries have for relations are total conflict or total agreement neither of which is possible or desirable
6690730 we are stuck in relationships in which major powers are not enemies but not friends
6690731 the un isnt working the new world order and the democracy surplus never came to be but there are networks of capital and cooperation between russia china and the west that werent there before

6690734 russias strength is made possible by oil at 150 a barrel
6690735 if oil is cut to 60 a barrel russia is sunk russians spend less on research and development than poland they want bank accounts in the west to make millionaires off sales to europe they dont want a big war they want to gain influence and manipulate
6690736 that depends on how big fannie and freddie blow up

6690738 he was very fair and understanding and had a big heart
6690739 this is the iraqi governments view and what the government wants

6690754 i think the big story here today is that there is for the first time an expression by foxwoods to reconsider their current site and they are actively exploring other sites that are not on the waterfront
6690755 we have shared with city and state officials the obstacles that resiting would entail
6690756 following those discussions we have agreed in principle to consider other alternative sites and ways that we can mutually overcome those obstacles we are committed to continuing those discussions while preserving our rights to the south columbus boulevard site
6690757 we anticipated that there would be two different meetings because the issues are different
6690758 a good first step towards achieving the goal of re siting both casinos
6690759 process is important and we dont want to go from one backroom deal to another
6690760 the people of philadelphia should be able to say whether they want casinos and where their preferred location should be not the casinos
6690761 its not time for celebration but its time to be optimistic
6690762 held in a secure format on site and downloaded onto a memory stick for processing which has since been lost
6690763 its entrusted with a great deal of highly confidential material and it seems to be entirely incapable of keeping it secure
6690764 and the consequences are very serious theyre serious because it may lead to the identity of the people involved being revealed
6690765 one of the possible consequences is that they criminals will bring legal actions against the government and the taxpayer will then have to pay damages to people who appear to be pretty undeserving because of the governments incompetence
6690766 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost
6690767 we will then decide what further action may be appropriate searching questions must be answered about what safeguards were in place to protect this information
6690768 if you hand out memory sticks almost like confetti to companies and ask them to do research for you then you have to be absolutely certain that the company concerned has put in practice procedures which will be just as robust as the procedures that i hope the government has followed
6690769 its rather like reading a book that seems familiar and realising that you have read it all before
6690770 they are not trying to take cities but this is a strategic offensive to gain as much ground as possible in the gap between the us presidential election and the next administration getting into office
6690771 they want to paralyse the afghan government create a crisis within nato and force the west to negotiate in the spring
6690772 the police officials and mps are afraid to go out into the districts because they are all in taliban hands
6690773 even in the district centres authority does not stretch outside the official compounds
6690774 it is more of a traditional 21st century insurgency in that sense with taliban going into areas preaching radical propaganda and taking advantage of local anger with the police or government
6690775 were not exactly the u s pattern but pretty close to it
6690776 trata se de um acordo bastante complexo fizemos ced ncias e o iraque tamb m
6690777 preston have a had a great start and will be full of confidence so we need to be aware of that
6690778 it was the best news that ive gotten almost since we started this project
6690779 we have some days and weeks of analysis on the bids that we received today
6690780 if the cost is 790 million i think thats achievable
6690781 its premature at this point to say its definitely do able
6690782 if this project is financially do able we will need the cooperation of city council as it relates to the increase in the hotel tax
6690783 you have to get into the bids and really dig in to make sure there are no kickers
6690784 we wont know for sure until we really get a chance to dig into those and examine those
6690785 expects russia to abide by its agreement to withdraw forces
6690786 our draft resolution is a reconfirmation of the six point agreement and theres no territorial integrity in the six principles
6690787 we believe the six principles are clear and already implemented
6690788 what we see on the ground is the result of ambiguity
6690789 we have a presence of so called russian peacekeeping forces at key georgian choke points that will control economic life it will control humanitarian activities thats why clarifications are so important
6690790 there is no bread there is no food no medicine people are dying
6690791 i cannot go on like this anymore i cry every day
6690792 its not they its we who will erase them from the face of earth
6690793 we want everyone to know the truth about the terrible events in tskhinvali with the hope that such a thing will never again happen on our land
6690794 the economy is stuck somewhere between sluggish growth and recession
6690795 the decline in the leading index should therefore not be interpreted as a sign the outlook is quickly deteriorating
6690796 thats critical while consumers may be cautious and conservative in their spending as long as the rate does not spike there should be enough income growth to keep the economy muddling along
6690797 hay dos borradores de resoluciones sobre la mesa y mi lectura es que el consejo no est en disposici n de respaldar ninguno de los dos
6690798 la resoluci n tal como est ahora no contar con el apoyo de mi gobierno y para nosotros sigue siendo importante que se reafirme la integridad territorial de georgia
6690799 nadie puede considerar que se encuentre cerca de la zona de conflicto
6690800 competitiveness is good for basketball but dangerous in other spheres such as investing
6690801 in the league for a while you get pretty cynical
6690802 this is a gamble who says this is going the make the team better
6690803 jameers job as a point guard is to play at a high level and to show leadership at a high level by doing this correctly he creates more value for himself both with orlando and the rest of the league
6690804 this is a business and the end product is how many games you win
6690805 i love basketball but at the same time i know it isnt going to last forever that check is going to stop coming one day
6690806 i feel like i could have given that money to my brother my sister or my mom instead of the casino
6690807 to yourself or imagine putting a stop sign in front of your negative thought
6690808 we have a whale whose condition has deteriorated rapidly over the last 24 hours and who now experts are telling us is suffering and weve had to make the hard decision to euthanize the whale
6690809 we have to prepare for the world coming to the arctic
6690810 if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have different perspective
6690811 i will put my judgment on foreign policy over the last five years against john mccains any time any time
6690812 i think an objective analysis would say ive been right a lot more than he has for all his years in washington
6690813 to halt international military co operation events between russia and nato countries until further instructions
6690814 the plane would not fail to the point of causing a tragedy
6690815 most likely whatever the malfunction of the probe was it is probably not related to what happened
6690816 he was a humble man what wrong did he do to anyone why was he punished these cruel people have taken away the great shadow of my father
6690817 all around the gate i saw blood and human flesh
6690818 people helped the injured and took them in their cars and even on motorbikes to the hospital
6690819 seven or eight people were already dead and another 10 people were breathing their last
6690820 there are two torn bodies lying there which we believe are those of the suicide bombers
6690821 only innocent people die when the pakistan army carries out air strikes in bajur or swat
6690822 we arrived three minutes late and they let us check in but we did not make it we ended up trying to find a new flight then we discovered the plane we would have been on had crashed
6690823 we had no idea what had happened my mouth dropped open
6690824 everyone thinks of the titanic disaster as very straightforward ship hits big lump of ice with inevitable result
6690825 who do you want to answer the phone at 3 a m
6690826 as long as clinton was a viable candidate in the democratic nomination process many of our members felt a passionate need to return the loyalty she has earned over decades of support
6690827 these were basically attacks intended to result in the social exclusion or humiliation of the speaker punctuated on occasion with profanity a nasty glare or even a solid punch to the arm
6690828 what did the big chimney say to the little chimney
6690829 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humor in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker
6690830 being selected as an appropriate audience for a stupid joke suggests that there is something amiss with the hearers sense of humor
6690831 i told them just go out and tell bad jokes be a hero in the field
6690832 the younger you are and the closer you are in age to your failed humorist the more likely you are to attack
6690833 i may have been nancy funny but i was not french speaking nancy funny
6690834 im going to take a nap wake me up when the mets win one without a ridiculous amount of luck
6690835 our guys did not find any powder there were maybe a couple of grains of something inside an envelope and they had to kind of work to get a sample
6690836 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off it is imminent
6690837 as we see this phenomenon occurring further and further north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
6690838 its a signal but we dont know what it means
6690839 even if there was an athlete that wanted to speak out on issues of human rights he might be silenced by whatever ioc official is mediating that press event
6690840 massive suppression of any voice that the government doesnt want heard
6690841 i was pretty confident thats the way it would go
6690842 im just glad steve will still have me after last year
6690843 i made a mistake and i want the chance to wipe it out everyone wants a bathurst win on their cv
6690844 after the events of red alert 2 the leadership of the doomed soviet union devises a plan to travel back in time and assassinate albert einstein 8 whose own time travels led to the events of the previous two games in order to change history and restore the soviet union as a world power
6690845 tesla coils heavily armed war blimps teleportation armored bears intelligent dolphins floating island fortresses and transforming tanks
6690846 i said the heck is that and there was an alligator floating by
6690847 i took my flashlight and was like youve got to be kidding me a big old alligator swimming around here
6690848 they are trying to find dry land someplace to hide
6690849 we arrived three minutes late and they let us check in but we did not make it we ended up trying to find a new flight then we discovered the plane we would have been on had crashed
6690850 we had no idea what had happened my mouth dropped open
6690851 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6690852 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
6690853 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6690854 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6690855 yarls wood is to be congratulated on sustaining reasonable performance in many areas despite the upheavals of the change of management and reduction in staff numbers
6690856 yarls wood must seek to meet these concerns but they are ultimately issues for the uk border agency which must urgently address them
6690857 despite the efforts of centre staff prolonged detention was having a detrimental effect on the welfare and behaviour of children whose fear and distress was strongly reflected in our childrens interviews
6690858 children should be detained only in exceptional circumstances and then only for the shortest time necessary length of cumulative detention should be clearly and accurately recorded
6690859 yet at the time of the inspection over 40 of detainees had been at yarls wood for more than a month while there was a limited education programme a small amount of paid work and good library and physical education opportunities many detainees remained bored and insufficiently occupied
6690860 the nursery was well resourced but education and after school activities for children were inadequate
6690861 our experience reflects the opinions in the report there have been huge improvements but the same concerns remain about lack of access to legal advice and inappropriate detention of various groups children in particular
6690862 we know of an 11 year old boy who burst into tears saying he didnt want to go back into a cage after being put into one of the vans how can we do that to children
6690863 were determined to treat children within our immigration system with fairness and compassion thats why the majority stay in detention for a week or less
6690864 often children are only detained when their parents try to frustrate the removal process detention then becomes necessary to maintain a robust but fair asylum system those with no right to be in the uk must return home and last year we removed a person every eight minutes
6690865 the uk border agency will continue to seek alternatives to detention and in the next parliamentary session will adopt a legal duty to promote childrens welfare
6690866 he was a nice kid a friendly guy he didnt get into trouble he was at home most of the time he always helped people out if he could
6690867 maybe he was too nice he kept himself to himself he didnt get involved in trouble
6690868 ahmeds only been here a year the great achievement is he achieved nine gcses
6690869 ive spoken to his family and they are most proud of the fact that he got a c in maths and a c in science he also got two other c grades
6690870 family members came in and found out about his results but not his parents because they were too upset
6690871 the family is shocked and devastated his tutor said to me he never would have expected ahmed to be involved in this sort of incident
6690872 the victim was with a group of friends on the 13th floor of a tower block when they became concerned about another group of youths cycling towards the tower block
6690873 this caused the victim and his friends to leave the area the victim was separated from his friends
6690874 he climbed on to the outside of the tower block via an open balcony and then climbed down several floors trying to escape
6690875 he reached the seventh floor when he could no longer carry on after this point he fell to his death
6690876 the other group involved are described as black male youths some were wearing hooded tops others were wearing bandanas and were riding pedal cycles
6690877 theres no doubt smaller cars are holding their value better the rate of depreciation on large cars has accelerated a lot more
6690878 in 2003 a large car would lose 19 per cent of its value in the first year 4 per cent in the second and 7 per cent in the third now its more like 26 per cent in the first year eight per cent in the second year and 10 per cent in the third year
6690879 the price of fuel affected consumer confidence and it also affected used car prices used car prices have dropped dramatically
6690880 over the last 30 days weve seen auction values deteriorate in the range of 12 to 13 per cent
6690881 in the future we will put more resources into the training and mentoring of the afghan army
6690882 there are now 60 000 in the afghan army i believe the figures will go up from 60 000 to 80 000 and then 120 000
6690883 i believe that in time the figure for the afghan army given the size of this country may need to be even higher than 120 000
6690884 we emphasized the importance of better co operation between the two countries particularly in dealing with the insurgents that are coming across the border from pakistan to afghanistan
6690885 pakistan and the problem of terrorism there and coming from there is something that has to be raised with the pakistani government and i will continue to do so
6690886 sort out the government so that we have a full attack on corruption so that we deal with the problem of narcotics
6690887 we want to see on the ground the delivery of the results
6690888 such actions create mistrust and spur an arms race on the continent and beyond its borders
6690889 its clear to us and the american leadership doesnt deny it that the so called missile shield in europe will be widened and modernized in that case russia will be compelled to react and not only by diplomatic protests
6690890 i lifted my head and all i saw were scattered bodies
6690891 the boy was in good shape he complained of some pain but what concerned him most was finding his parents
6690892 it is important for bourses operating in our country to form a regional securities supermarket by offering several instruments and services through functional cooperation with the bourses in the region
6690893 there is some kind of expectations of doing something before the end of the year
6690894 i believe that the timeline is important but what is more important is the content and the nature of the understanding that we can reach with the palestinians
6690895 i think any attempt to bridge gaps which might be premature to bridge or any attempt to reach something which is not the comprehensive agreement we want to reach can lead to clashes this can lead to misunderstandings this can lead to violence
6690896 the question of how long it should be on the shelf depends not on our willingness but on the situation on the ground
6690897 this is the reason we negotiate with pragmatic leaders even though they dont control anything in gaza strip which is being controlled completely by hamas even in the west bank they are not strong enough
6690898 when we are talking two states for two people the idea is israel is the homeland for the jewish people and the palestinian state is the homeland for the palestinians
6690899 this is one of the two basic pillars the other of course is israels security
6690900 what the palestinians call the right to return is not an option
6690901 in the memory of the heroes of our brothers and sisters savagely murdered by the bloody aggressor
6690902 it all depends on nato priorities if they prefer to support the bankrupt saakashvili regime to partnership with russia that will not be our fault
6690903 i can only say that russia needs cooperation with nato no more than nato needs russia
6690904 two men apparently blew themselves up outside the factory during a shift change the bombers were on foot and they exploded themselves less than a minute apart
6690905 there are 45 people confirmed dead in the blast the number of injured is very high and we are right now collecting information
6690906 i was working in the factory when i heard one blast and then another they were huge
6690907 security people then immediately surrounded the place and we were not allowed to go outside they allowed us out one by one after clearing the area
6690908 the blast took place as staff were leaving after finishing their days duty and it was very crowded
6690909 we have 25 ambulances working and there also army and factory staff engaged in the rescue work
6690910 the cement industry with its energy intensive production process is feeling the impact of the rapid increase in the price of thermal and electrical power sources very directly
6690911 so far the resulting cost increases have only partially been passed on to customers and with a delay
6690912 private residential construction activity continued to decline and there were growing signs of a downturn in the commercial and industrial sectors
6690913 we are confident that our business having been restructured is in a strong position to move forward whenever the market improves
6690914 the causes will have to be provided not only by the company but also by the black boxes which compile all the flight data
6690915 knowing the plane was bad it took off with my 7 year old niece
6690916 we hope he is one of the injured but his name is not among the survivors we feel very sorry
6690917 we hope the very difficult and delicate task of identification can be done with the utmost efficiency
6690918 a plane doesnt crash due to engine failure or a fire on takeoff
6690919 the technical inspection by spanair could have committed a fatal error
6690920 zmir port is turkeys biggest container export harbor but certainly it is not managed properly
6690921 since september 2004 exporters have been paying additional fees at the zmir port due to the congestion the privatization of the port is crucial in terms of efficiency and increasing capacity
6690922 the privatization process was launched and the formalities were completed except for the legal procedures since there were no investments in this period the ports problems are gradually growing
6690923 turkeys total container handling capacity is nearly 25 percent of a large international port this is a shame for the country in order to increase the export volume ports have to be developed
6690924 zmir is the most convenient city for exports with its railway motorway airway connections storage opportunities and free trade zones
6690925 the capacity will be increased by the investments following the end of the privatization process
6690926 turkey aims to have exports worth 500 billion in 2020
6690927 approximating imports to reach 500 billion the ports and motorways which will carry 1 trillion trade volume should be determined as of today
6690928 they created this spy comedy set in the cold war era that lampooned the political landscape
6690929 it was borne of the seeds of james bond with a little bit of clouseau thrown in but it really became its own event
6690930 its like taking your dads beautiful sports car for a ride you just dont want to crash it
6690931 although we had to embrace the spirit of the show to please core fans basically we were making a movie for the uninitiated
6690932 in keeping with what mel brooks and buck henry had to say about the cold war there is a right time for get smart and now seems to be that time
6690933 we couldnt have made this movie five or six years ago so close to 9 11 but eventually we have to be able to laugh otherwise ultimately the terrorists win
6690934 i actually turned down the film a couple of times over the past few years because i didnt feel there was the right actor out there to play max
6690935 it was such an iconic series that i didnt want to mess with it
6690936 but when the producers called to say they had carell on board for the first time it sounded right
6690937 once i got the role i was very honest about my abilities i said to myself dont put the pressure on yourself to keep up or be funny just keep out of steves way
6690938 she led she followed she did everything she should do
6690939 steve and i have to be two of the unlikeliest action heroes youll ever see
6690940 one of the reasons why 99 was such a fun role is because it is so different from my personality
6690941 i dont see myself as a bond girl but i would like to play moneypenny
6690942 i would love to play a bond villain one of those psychopaths that hopes to kill james and destroy the world
6690943 x360 duke nukem est un succ s sur xbox 360
6690944 well have agreement when we have agreement so all of those stories in the newspapers about what the agreement says probably ought to be disregarded until we have an agreement
6690945 we are continuing to work to make sure that any timelines that are in the agreement really do reflect what we believe can be done whats feasible
6690946 obviously everybody is going to keep an eye on conditions on the ground
6690947 today thursday condoleezza rice the occupation foreign secretary arrived in iraq to try to put pressure on the government of iraq to accept terms dictated by the occupation to sign this ominous treaty
6690948 they stole our money for decades whats wrong if good muslims enjoy a little bit of power
6690949 i humbly suggest the prime minister should perhaps consider some of these ideas for his second term
6690950 although the salt lake spanned 216 400 hectares in 1915 it was reduced to 92 600 hectares in 1987 and 32 600 hectares in 2005 we have proof of this through satellite photos
6690951 drought irresponsible irrigation practices and the drying up of water resources brought about the end of the lake it is said that the lakes water covers a bigger area during winter but it is only a swamp in winter you see mud instead of water
6690952 as soon as the new parliamentary session opens in september the pardon will be covered in our agenda
6690953 the draft is expected to be discussed in the parliament in september and will be finalized in october we prepared the draft bill and now we are briefing the authorities we are in the process of discussing when the pardon will start and who will benefit from it there will be no stepping back on that
6690954 i had said that it is important how many students are waiting for pardon and on what grounds when i received the paperwork for the pardon i thought this can be done after being discussed then i asked for a draft bill
6690955 we cannot keep up with registrations both our koran courses and mosques are full students and parents are really interested in our courses
6690956 last year 61 000 students took part in our courses attendance increases every year
6690957 i congratulate you for winning those medals while we are coming to the end of the games and wish you more success
6690958 closure of dervish monasteries and tombs the abolition of the office of keeper of tombs and the abolition and prohibition of certain titles
6690959 allow islamist brotherhood organizations religious orders communal politics and the modern turkish republic to coexist through a national reconciliation
6690960 will make turkey a strong regional power enjoying domestic tranquility
6690961 closure of dervish monasteries and tombs the abolition of the office of keeper of tombs and the abolition and prohibition of certain titles
6690962 abolition of titles and appellations such as efendi bey or pasha
6690963 bolt set it off after that i just think the jamaican camp went crazy
6690964 it is a great time for chinese sport i am honored to have been part of this
6690965 i spoke to the prime minister on the phone and he told me everybody is in the streets
6690966 there is a big motorcade in the town square of falmouth that has been going on for more than two hours
6690967 the town square was blocked for more than an hour before it cleared a bit but the celebrations are continuing some persons have placed desks in the road and placed a vast amount of liquor on them for everyone to drink and be merry it is just like carnival down here
6690968 i was so excited it was as if i had won the gold myself this is truly amazing
6690969 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6690970 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6690971 when i saw the start he made to the race i just thought wow it was a much better start than the one he made in winning the 100m on saturday this is bolts favorite event and he wanted that record he went for it he came here focused on it he knew that most likely hed win gold but gave it every single thing he had
6690972 my concern and the reason i thought he might not get the world record here was that he wouldnt have been working on his speed endurance the ability to hold that speed for the entire race
6690973 i dont see any reason why he couldnt now move up to the 400m but im not sure if hell be able to break the world record in that in my opinion hell now switch his focus back to the 100m knowing theres a little more he can take off the 9 69sec he can start better and go down into the low 9 60sec
6690974 i dont know where this information is coming from but there is no official application we have received yet besides i dont see any reason why musharraf should leave his country considering the way he left office
6690975 it could be difficult for him to remain in pakistan because of security reasons and political turbulence in the country what if he wants to settle in turkey what will you say
6690976 we will not think about what we will do he comes and goes or returns to pakistan
6690977 right now russia leaving germany behind has become our most important partner in foreign trade so we cannot approach russia as the way other countries do
6690978 some 748 houses in kalkan are owned by foreigners the majority of who are british nationals the belgian and the dutch people follow the british in home purchases
6690979 they are our citizens not guests kalkan is selected the most romantic place by these people
6690980 the population of kalkan increases to 10 000 people during the summer months and drops to 3 000 during the winter
6690981 kalkan was a fishing town before its tourism potential was discovered the germans italians and some other european tourists began to visit the town in the 1980s the british tourists followed them most of the british people who buy homes here spend their summer holidays in the town when they do not come they rent out their homes there are also foreigners who have settled in the town but their numbers are not great
6690982 the turkish people are warmer in character when compared to the british people one may not know his or her neighbor in england but everybody knows each other in kalkan i want to live in turkey with my husband and daughter until i die i believe our daughter will grow up more comfortably here however i do not know whether i will be buried in a muslim or a christian cemetery
6690983 in our first visit to kalkan six years ago we rented a house here then we bought a house and settled in the town
6690984 my husband made a request to be buried in a christian cemetery in kalkan now i cannot leave the town leaving him here the local people and my english friends supported me a lot during my difficult days i love kalkan and feel like a local person here
6690985 kalkan is much hotter than germany when i wake up each morning i look through the window expecting that the weather may be cloudy today however it is always sunny without a single rain cloud
6690986 when the project supported by the university has been completed the first geo park of turkey will have been founded in manisa
6690987 we are proud of hosting the first geo park in turkey kula volcanic area is one of the most important places in turkey due to its geological formation and layout the finest attribute of this volcanic area is that there are 68 volcanic vents in a 50 000 square meter area
6690988 among them there are footprints which are estimated to be 26 000 years old
6690989 with the project submitted to the eu fund the footprints will be put under complete protection and undiscovered footprints will be dug out of soil through excavations thousands of tourists visit the eressos antissa region in greece to see the rare fossil trees every year in addition to volcanic vents there are natural formations such as the adala canyon and the fairy chimneys in kula we believe that manisa will be the first geo park of turkey when the project is put into practice many enthusiasts of historical tourism will come to our city from the whole world we will be the pioneer of the geo tourism in turkey
6690990 its expected that unesco will register the project when the footprints existing near sindel village are taken under protection we will apply to unesco for the registration of protection as part of our project after we have completed the geo park our goal is to make the public aware of geo parks on the domestic national and international level and to contribute to transferring these kinds of formations to future generations accepting them as world heritage sites we will attempt to be a member of the european geopark network with the strategies and actions to be taken at the end of the project
6690991 we will discuss the project with armenia to construct a cooperation region with five countries
6690992 early measures to resolve frozen problems in the region and prevent instability in the future
6690993 this is our understanding on all problems we are no enemy to anyone in the region
6690994 the abant lake natural park is in danger due to the crowds visiting and the erosion that pushes the land into the lake
6690995 the juniper pine and fir trees inside the park will not be able to survive if no measure is taken
6690996 there has been 30 percent extra evaporation in the lake each year since 2005
6690997 there should be a serious master plan the peoples entrance into the forest should be planned the goats and cattle are free to roam inside the forest but people enter the forest from anywhere and their trekking harms the land and plants in the forest and leads to erosion
6690998 or how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb
6690999 mr president we can not allow a mind shaft gap
6691000 on aug 29 i will swim underwater for 28 hours to cover a distance of 48 kilometers from rhodes to marmaris
6691001 we have lodged an appeal the trial will begin in september
6691002 we are working with turkey to facilitate the transport of humanitarian assistance in the most expeditious manner under the rules of the montreux convention
6691003 thousands of our students traveled to several places in turkey going across to the east from the west and from the west to the east seeing numerous beautiful spots for the first time in their lives and forming friendships
6691004 this was a great experience for them as their experiences are enriched their belief and hopes for the future will grow and their dreams will diversify we just for these reasons are extremely fond of this project we are happy to have made a contribution to their development as individuals we hope they will be able to take initiative and make their own decisions in the future
6691005 the london bus has become very popular as a means of transport for both tourists and local citizens

6691009 i was simply a shepherd but i am going to be a medical doctor
6691010 i lost my arm because there was no medical doctor in the village at that time
6691011 but it was not an obstacle for me rather it made me more ambitious i worked hard and i succeeded i am happy that i will be a medical doctor in the future
6691012 but i pursued a disciplined way of study i spent 10 hours a day studying my teachers also helped me a lot
6691013 my parents could not even meet the school expenses of my brother a student of social work at hacettepe university
6691014 we shall do urgently whatever necessary to provide rfan first a prosthetic arm and then sufficient amount of scholarship
6691015 i wish all kids in the country set their main goal in life as early as possible just as rfan did
6691016 his ambition showed us many things we are ready to do whatever necessary to assist him i thank his family which spent great effort to grow him up and his teachers for their contribution to his success
6691017 many people called me from all around turkey and the world my phone did not stop ringing yesterday i thank everyone who would like to provide me financial assistance
6691018 do i think that the idea to promote regional cooperation in the region is a good one and that turkey has a role to play here
6691019 the answer is yes but this particular proposal is not the way to approach it in a general sense i would agree that turkey has a role to play and needs to be more active
6691020 we are ready to discuss with turkey all kinds of regional initiatives but at this stage there is no possibility that we enter any cooperation mechanism with russia as long as the occupation goes on and a single occupying soldier stays on my soil
6691021 after occupying forces leave and all of those people who were forced out of their houses go back then we will start talking and discussing future probabilities and possibilities but again i can assure that the territorial integrity of georgia will maintain
6691022 can you imagine georgia being in any kind of regional group with russia when it has just invaded that country and still has troops on its soil this is like inviting the fox in the hen house
6691023 i have to take that with a great deal of skepticism
6691024 i can imagine a regional grouping between turkey plus the caucasus countries azerbaijan armenia and georgia of course even then it would be difficult without some kind of regulation of relations with armenia i cannot imagine even azerbaijan is too interested especially now helping a regional partnership with russia
6691025 i think that whats great about the turkish initiative is that mr erdo an is one of the few people who have talked to all of these people as a neutral person i think thats more important than the substance of the caucasus stability and cooperation pact
6691026 if dark knight failed to perform way above expectations this would have been a decidedly down summer

6691035 the explosion occurred in a vacant car left at the blast scene we believe the blast was the result of plastic explosives set off by remote control
6691036 i think we now have very convincing evidence that prdm16 can turn cells into brown fat cells with the possibility of combating obesity
6691037 we can hold zekai tahir burak hospital responsible for baby deaths but we should also consider its burden
6691038 an increase in the workload of the hospital caused a surge in infection rates during july and the first week of august most of the babies lost were underweight and their lives were already at risk most of them were born after ivf in vitro fertilization
6691039 less than 30 percent of newborn babies who are born under 1 000 grams can live as the number of premature births increases the number of deaths similarly shows a rise the deaths arent related to infections
6691040 ivf is a risk factor for multiple pregnancies and babies at risk
6691041 we will oblige all ivf centers to equip a special center where the risky pregnancies can be monitored babies will be treated in intensive care rooms as well ivf will only be allowed under these circumstances
6691042 most university hospitals are equipped adequately for ivf births but most of the demand falls on the shoulders of public hospitals
6691043 british petroleum and partners have started testing the 1 768 kilometer line following repairs to damage caused by a fire on aug 5

6691045 there are 42 prisoners who are in worse condition than erbakan some of them are cancer patients while the rest suffer from other illnesses however if g l remembers only erbakan let him do they are the comrades of the same lawsuit
6691046 if mr g l were not the president he would be in jail now
6691047 the same negligence is seen in this case as well
6691048 the time they spent with ahmadinejad and al bashir is enough he should deal with domestic problems he should think about hazelnuts
6691049 neither who will purchase hazelnuts nor how much will he pay is certain thus hazelnut growers had to sell their products at ytl 3 in giresun and ytl 2 7 in ordu due to financial problems

6691054 our investments in turkey will continue despite the crisis and the stagnation in the real estate sector
6691055 armenia was always in favor of dialogue and talks particularly on the issues concerning cooperation and security in our region
6691056 the turkish prime ministers statement on the intention to start talks with armenia on this agenda could be welcomed
6691057 the government encouraged the construction of cotton textile factories and investment in the field during the period and we decided to invest in edirne however during our search for appropriate land we realized that the area is rather far from istanbul
6691058 we consulted turgut zal the undersecretary at the state planning organization or dpt at the time and asked whether these incentives also applied to istanbul or not zal said the state might provide incentives to the company if the company realizes investment in 50 000 looms instead of 25 000 looms i informed him that our company could only realize this investment on a two stage basis he was very pleased with our answer and agreed to provide incentives for the company
6691059 i thought that we would get the license of the land from the istanbul metropolitan municipality but the village headman and the village council gave the license of the land to our company
6691060 there were only a farm and a limekiln in the region at the time however the region has witnessed a notable improvement afterwards as many factories were constructed in the region
6691061 we were planning to earn considerably from this investment however the french company stopped its investments in turkey and left the country following the 1994 economic crisis it was the first time that we thought about constructing a shopping center
6691062 we moved our factory to l leburgaz in 2005 we are undertaking the construction of 212 istanbul at the moment and the residents of istanbul and ba c lar will take pride in the project after it is completed
6691063 i like this sector i had difficulty in terms of coming up with an investment area after our company sold its shares in tekstilbank i have been working 16 hours a day at the moment and i am pleased with it
6691064 our priority is to complete the construction of this project later we will search for and evaluate the appropriate real estate in istanbul meanwhile we will also continue to invest in the textile sector
6691065 unless necessary measures are taken and artisans do their best turkish tourism wont have a bright future regardless of the increase in tourist numbers
6691066 tourists should not be disturbed by these people we also have foreign guide problem some tourism agencies send guides who dont even have any tourism education and dont know anything about turkey to the country in order to pay less money these guides recommend tourists to bargain in shopping and not to trust anyone they harm the image of our artisans and our country
6691067 many of our holiday towns have turned into a concrete jungle and service quality lowered meanwhile the number of holiday alternatives has increased all around the world and the lack of a tourism policy have made our artisans situation worse
6691068 i have been working as a journalist in marmaris for 13 years despite the number of tourists increase more and more every other season artisans have gone bad i think the most important reason for this situation is foreign tour operators which sell turkish hotels at giveaway price
6691069 if theres an opportunity we would like to look at it
6691070 whether we do it depends on our assessment and risk diversification
6691071 the steep price of new debt raises the level of difficulty for both institutions in remaining solvent as higher interest rate costs cuts steeply into their operating margins thereby threatening both agencies with even deeper losses in coming quarters
6691072 as you would expect we have been in communication with the companies for months to receive updates weve also been communicating with their regulator and the federal reserve
6691073 me permito proponer que se revise el calendario de reuniones del consejo nacional de seguridad p blica para que esta voluntad pol tica pueda ser acompa ada del mandato de ley lo cual significa que modifiquemos algunos procedimientos plazos y convocatorias para que podamos revisar puntualmente el avance de estos acuerdos toda vez que hay tiempos establecidos que en consecuencia de esta reuni n deber haber reuniones espec ficas tem ticas territoriales y las correspondientes en los estados y municipios toda vez que se ha expresado el surgimiento del observador ciudadano

6691088 no lo conozco pero escuch que rudy ulloa el choferata de kirchner anda con 100 palos verdes y lo quiere comprar
6691089 i knew i had the ability but i didnt know if i really had it on today im really thrilled and i couldnt be happier
6691090 we wont have access to the content of e mails passwords or anything like that
6691091 if you try to make contact to a lot of addresses where there are no machines it indicates youre probing around the network because you dont know whats there
6691092 most people who contact a network legitimately know whats there and they go directly to the web server or mail server or some other well known service in the network
6691093 i could tell you that eastlink customers in general visit google im not sure thats a particularly sensitive piece of information
6691094 heres this very high level information and how do you determine based on that that heres a security event that isnt being picked up by anything else how do you begin to present that information
6691095 it has been a tough and winding road for me to get here
6691096 i know my placing is not good enough but it was really important for me to finish this olympic event
6691097 i was really tired at 38 kimometers and the final twelve kilometers were very tough for me
6691098 costins never say die attitude earned him huge respect here in beijing he was never prepared to throw in the towel on a day when even spectators were desperately seeking the shade in sheltered spots around the 50 kilometer race walk course close to the olympic stadium
6691099 no matter what happened out there i knew that i had to finish the course
6691100 my family are here and it has been eight years since i last competed in an olympic games so i wanted to make the best of my chance here in beijing
6691101 alistair will need to engage and be prepared to mix it in the the final and i think that he will go in there well prepared and ready to give it his best shot
6691102 he responded very well to the news of his qualification and all is well with him right now
6691103 but its a busy port and its a long distance from the airport yarmouth is quiet youve got a kilometre ride from the airport to the harbour
6691104 they would not be in yarmouth if we didnt have this facility
6691105 those first critical things that they do are very important to building this chain of survival
6691106 there could be terrible bleeding but you dont deal with the bleeding first you deal with the airway first then breathing then circulation
6691107 it means that the paramedics have to get in to kneel down to access the patient and touch them that means sometimes people have to move
6691108 the right kinds of things were done for this patient but hearing that can be upsetting for people

6691116 its nice and safe its quiet there at night its perfect were all like one big family especially on the first floor
6691117 our community is changing and thats not a bad thing
6691118 we want to make sure that all people have a decent place to live
6691119 this new facility will give vulnerable individuals an opportunity to build a stronger future for themselves
6691120 were one of many organizations wanting to provide housing for people who just cant participate in the economy
6691121 i couldnt believe what i was witnessing and its been with me ever since
6691122 when i requested that the cuffs be removed or loosened after arriving in a safe and secure environment the officer grabbed my middle finger aggressively pulled on it and asked if i could feel that
6691123 sometimes they really do overexert their power a bit much
6691124 i think that the police as an institution is inherently violent and enforces inherently violent laws in very violent ways
6691125 the easy answer is people dealing with their sort of disputes among themselves
6691126 as a result of the complaints obviously well be looking into the complaints
6691127 were still trying to determine if hes still in the area
6691128 we dont know if hes local or just passing through the area
6691129 whats happening to me has made me love this place even more
6691130 its amazing to me all the people here have been so concerned and it really makes me want to stay here i just appreciate things even more
6691131 i just wanted to get out of police custody so i just said if you let me go no matter what the date i entered was ill leave on my own
6691132 i dont think i was breaking any law but i was really worried about pixie so i just wanted to be released from police custody
6691133 im just worried about the expense of crossing the border
6691134 i mean he lives day to day its a hardship
6691135 hes just a simple fellow who gives pleasure to the community through his music
6691136 i felt sick when i heard he would have to leave absolutely sick
6691137 i just want him to be able to stay here and keep doing what he loves to do
6691138 ive had offers as is why should i keep it its never gonna happen
6691139 no its not ive had it for 18 years and its never gonna happen
6691140 well i want to have the seats recovered new carpeting new headliner and get a candy apple red paint job
6691141 none of thats going to do you any good if you cant drive it
6691142 well it is losing pressure in the 20 minutes later so it needs 10 more minutes
6691143 is that all a new manifold heads reworked new cam exaust system new plugs belts wires and hoses
6691144 ok heres the plan im going to start buying parts for it one part at a time when i get enough parts together to start on it are you going to help me restore it
6691145 wait you didnt mention those when you were telling me what was wrong with it
6691146 well they have to be replaced first or you cant drive it anyway
6691147 ok the first thing i will buy are shocks and struts
6691148 no none of that is going to do you any good until you get a dog bone
6691149 what whats a dogbone got to do with a car im not letting the fucking dog ride in the car especially eating a dogbone
6691150 well the one in there has to be replaced and without it 30 minutes later so you have to have a dog bone
6691151 if it was me i would put in a side mount v 8 and make the modifications you could do 45 minutes later now that would be fiiiiiinne
6691152 screw that im not putting a side mount v 8 in it
6691153 fine dont put a side mount v 8 in it its a good plan though
6691154 sooooooo what is the first part i need to buy
6691155 well i guess you probably better get new tires those need to be replaced they all have leaks and have been sitting so long they wont hold air
6691156 stop its not you youve had 18 years to do something with it and you havent even tried to start im sick of this just tell me what the first thing i need to buy is
6691157 we have in the halifax regional municipality one of the highest calibre tap waters in the country if not in north america and we should celebrate that point
6691158 a lot of people like myself dont like diet pop and i shouldnt be drinking as much pop so i try and buy water i know there are concerns with that but sometimes theres no other option when you are trying to find something to drink
6691159 i dont believe there is a need to do so but that is up to each individual municipality
6691160 its because of the strong steps that weve made in that regard im able to say that
6691161 ive always thought its rather silly for people to be paying double for something that theyre already getting because they are already paying through their taxes for the municipal water systems
6691162 why buy bottled water when you can go to your tap theres some cases when perhaps you are going on a trip or you need the portability of it but most people dont and the tap water is well tested here in nova scotia as it is in most municipalities across canada
6691163 either way the goal is for people to come together and enjoy delicious food grown right here in nova scotia
6691164 unfortunately shes not at a position where we can entertain her going back to public school
6691165 it wasnt a consideration we knew that we were going to have to find the money somewhere and wed actually already taken some money out of our rrsps getting ready to pay the full shot this year
6691166 the fourth year of funding will ease the burden for those parents who are having financial challenges with tuition
6691167 what were looking at is the government recognizing that this is whats best for these children and theyre recognizing that they can do this without costing the taxpayer another penny
6691168 im pleased the minister has moved to accommodate the fourth year but i hope its the first stage of what will be public policy coming forward once the final recommendations are made by the minister
6691169 asserting what is right and what needs to be done
6691170 its a hell of a time not to have it its the worst thousand metres i have put together in years
6691171 i couldnt believe what i was witnessing and its been with me ever since
6691172 when i requested that the cuffs be removed or loosened after arriving in a safe and secure environment the officer grabbed my middle finger aggressively pulled on it and asked if i could feel that
6691173 sometimes they really do overexert their power a bit much
6691174 i think that the police as an institution is inherently violent and enforces inherently violent laws in very violent ways
6691175 the easy answer is people dealing with their sort of disputes among themselves
6691176 as a result of the complaints obviously well be looking into the complaints
6691177 were trying to piece together what happened but the good news story here was the fast response to get to the fire scene and that everyone is ok
6691178 well keep the pressure on until theyre taking this seriously
6691179 pay these physicians what they want so theyll work in rural communities
6691180 weve seen some of the pieces of the puzzle coming together
6691181 they will work as part of the health care team in the hospital and this will allow greater flexibility
6691182 there are key pieces to the puzzle and they all go hand in hand
6691183 this is the first time residents opposed to the track got to express our concerns before a meeting of the whole council they actually heard the stories of the people who would really be affected
6691184 we solicited their feedback about what we could do over and above what were trained to do and the decision was shared with them before it was made pubic and the family clearly understands our reasoning
6691185 i think after reading the presentence report its abundantly clear what you needed the money for
6691186 youre 35 years old thats really old to be doing break and enters or any crime for that matter
6691187 it felt like i was on fire from my wrist to my shoulder
6691188 some people at that meeting said there are places where the ground is literally moving with ants
6691189 they hold on to you and theyre so hard to brush off
6691190 worker ants will eat it and take it back to their queens
6691191 unfortunately shes not at a position where we can entertain her going back to public school
6691192 it wasnt a consideration we knew that we were going to have to find the money somewhere and wed actually already taken some money out of our rrsps getting ready to pay the full shot this year
6691193 the fourth year of funding will ease the burden for those parents who are having financial challenges with tuition
6691194 im going to have to stop the show unless everybody stands up
6691195 you know what im gonna ask next this song is called jump
6691196 if anyone out theres in love right now raise your hand
6691197 actually im just trying to see if theres anyone single out there
6691198 but what if the person you love goes out and cheats on you
6691199 it has been three years seven months and 21 days since that has been sitting there
6691200 the mayor would not live with this in her backyard premier rodney macdonald wouldnt live with it in his backyard so why should we
6691201 it should have been cleaned up and out of here long ago
6691202 they just keep pushing you around to someone else its like they dont want nothing to do with it
6691203 we dont want to perpetuate the myth that it is contaminated
6691204 sony ericsson hat sich in der letzten zeit marketingtechnisch deutlich besser positioniert vor allem konnte man sich durch ein ausgekl geltes jugendkultur sponsoring besser in szene setzen sodass nokia vor allem bei den j ngeren nun aufpassen muss den anschluss nicht zu verlieren
6691205 ausschlaggebend f r den siegeszug sony ericssons ist laut den usern vor allem dass man sich auf multi media handys konzentriert hat nokia hat sich dagegen zu stark auf die weiterentwicklung seiner computerplattformen konzentriert die viele kunden als zusatzfeatures uninteressant finden
6691206 ein wichtiger aspekt ist auch dass sony seit den 1980er jahren auf eine gro e erfahrung im bereich der unterhaltungselektronik zur ckgreifen kann dieser markt und wissenstransfer hat bei der entwicklung der sony ericsson ger te einen immensen einfluss

6691213 we continue to generate strong top line growth in both dollar sales and volume across all five of our operating segments
6691214 as we previously announced the higher feed input and fuel costs at our jennie o turkey store segment pressured profitability and contributed to the year over year decline in the companys third quarter results
6691215 relatively flat results in our refrigerated foods segment and a decline in investment income also presented unanticipated challenges during the quarter
6691216 we were encouraged by the strong top line and bottom line growth by our grocery products specialty foods and all other segments our grocery products and all other segments maintained the strong momentum they had during the first half of the year and our specialty foods segment rebounded nicely under difficult operating circumstances

6691219 die georgischen truppen waren unvorbereitet auf den gegenangriff der russischen seite

6691224 jetzt rufen wir die russische seite auf das waffenstillstandsabkommen zu respektieren und ihre truppen aus georgien abzuziehen
6691225 wir m ssen alle aber davon ausgehen dass die territoriale integrit t georgiens v lkerrechtlich anerkannt ist
6691226 afortunadamente me toc hacer los goles a m obvio estoy contento por la actuaci n del equipo por ganar por la gente que hoy hizo un lleno impresionante el apoyo tambi n fue bueno
6691227 todos somos importantes claro pero ahora la gente con experiencia siempre tenemos que sacar adelante al equipo
6691228 pesa el viaje el poco tiempo tambi n la altura eso es lo que pesa
6691229 tal vez pienso tambi n que hoy en d a tenemos bastantes jugadores y con los que estamos fuera y los que est n aqu en m xico tenemos un equipo muy competitivo entonces la competencia interna es muy fuerte y eso para el t cnico ser una dificultad
6691230 cuando no eres contundente adelante es dif cil pero hay que seguir adelante
6691231 tuvimos la oportunidad de haber concluido el partido en el segundo tiempo son cosas que pasan
6691232 era importante ganar en casa como sea el equipo mostr mucha actitud mucha personalidad se complic pero al final se pudo resolver de buena manera creo que el equipo mejorar con el tiempo adem s de que no jug mal futbol tuvo buena posesi n tuvimos variantes ofensivas no las metimos pero lleg bamos y eso habla bien de que con el poco tiempo que trabajamos ah vamos y con el tiempo mejoraremos bastante
6691233 fue muy complicado pero tuvimos el car cter para poder abrir al equipo contrario se vino a tirar atr s y buscar un error y aprovecharon un bal n parado tuvimos que remar contra la marea creo que tuvimos un buen manejo de bal n y aunque fue complicado abrirlos la virtud del equipo fue tener paciencia y al final nos dio resultado
6691234 a pesar de que consideramos negativa la toma que el gobierno venezolano hizo sobre las operaciones de cemex en aquel pa s el impacto en la p rdida de ebitda no resulta suficiente como para cambiar nuestra recomendaci n

6691240 because this is an automatic railway we cant use the new trains until we install new signalling and new computer equipment and to do that requires an extensive amount of testing on the railway weve testing the trains in derby but there is an amount you have to do on a real railway
6691241 and the way to do that with the minimum impact although we do understand its a slight inconvenience for our customers and we thank them for that but shutting it down monday to thursday a bit early that doubles the amount of time we can have on the railway
6691242 i think it will be a new experience for our customers youll see the new trains youll hopefully be able to get to work quicker more reliably and we can move more people which we need to do because the demand for our service keeps going up so weve got to do this just to stand still really
6691243 although you may not get much money back in some cases its better than nothing especially in these tough economic times and we all know how quickly the value of electronics depreciates so those poor saps holding onto their first generation iphones should probably unload them asap

6691287 some cultivars of brassicas contain relatively high concentrations of compounds known as glucosinolates carlson et al 1987 when brassica plants are incorporated into soil as green manures the glucosinolates are broken down by enzymes from the plant and soil bacteria to form several potentially biocidal compounds such as isothiocyanates lewis amp papavizas 1971 1970 most researchers believe that the compounds released by glucosinolate degradation are responsible for the reduction in pathogen populations caused by brassica green manures

6691308 every year we run a major training excavation as part of our ongoing research and practical teaching here at the university
6691309 we like to offer opportunities for volunteers to join students during their archaeological fieldwork
6691310 this dig is particularly fascinating little is known about leper hospitals compared to other medieval monastic institutions the people who lived here were condemned to a life of exile this site provides a unique chance over the next three years to survey and excavate an entire hospital including chapel and domestic buildings precinct and compound gatehouse as well as cemetery
6691311 fortunately the last of our british team had left the day before the conflict began but we are still deeply concerned for our colleagues and friends living in georgia
6691312 we were aware of heightened military activity during the recent excavation but we did not feel particularly threatened
6691313 it was obvious there was a fair bit of tension but there was no way of knowing what was about to happen we have recently started to get word from our colleagues in georgia an email on the 20 august said that russian troops have actually been in nokalakevi itself but the picture is far from complete and very worrying
6691314 a small regional museum in nokalakevi houses much of the material that we have excavated over the years and of course there is a concern the museum might become a target for looting
6691315 a few years ago 1 500 was raised to help repair the local museum and our dig house it is heartbreaking to think that this good work might have been undone but of course our main concern is for our friends and colleagues in georgia
6691316 we are an expedition of archaeologists and historians but we all share a love of georgia its culture and its people we hope to find some way of raising whatever funds we can to eventually help the country rebuild

6691403 it is probably true that in general the higher the education of the individual becomes the more their views are differentiated if we wish to find a high degree of uniformity and similarity of outlook we have to descend to the regions of lower moral and intellectual standards where the more primitive and common taste prevail this does not mean that the majority of people have low moral standards it merely means that the largest group of people whose values are very similar are the people with low standards it is as it were the lowest common denominator which unites the largest number of people

6691424 florentino balam se al que las escuelas de tiempo completo es una buena opci n para lograr una mejor preparaci n de los alumnos debido a que alargar el horario de clase permitir a los maestros dar materias adicionales nosotros creemos que tener m s tiempo los ni os implica darles otro tipo de preparaci n computo deportes mejores h bitos porque los tenemos muy poco tiempo lo tenemos 4 o 5 horas en la escuela y cuantas horas pasa frente al televisor cuantas horas en las calles cuantas en las maquinitas y eso tenemos que reconocerlo que a lo mejor si le ayuda pero la mayor a de las veces los programas televisivos con todo respeto muchos solo trastornan la mente tenemos altos ndices de delincuencia juvenil altos ndices de embarazos prematuros porque no hay una orientaci n adecuada entonces si hacemos la escuela de tiempo completo vamos a tener m s tiempo al ni o al joven no castig ndolo sino prepar ndolo porque el tiempo que le damos ya no es suficiente finaliz diciendo que esperan que el programa de escuelas de tiempo completo se implemente en todos los estados del pa s en este mismo a o

6691427 he looks quite smart i wonder what thats all about
6691428 i havent played enough to play the way i should i would rather have somebody else go over there
6691429 you dont want it to end this way but its all we could do
6691430 i curled inward hugging my ribs to hold myself together
6691431 we came out a little bit flat and got in a hole early and never seemed to get out of it
6691432 we had high expectations and i think were a better basketball team than we showed today but thats the way it goes sometimes
6691433 if you were to tell me before the season wed finish 19 0 id say that would be great but we all know what the big picture is
6691434 we all want to be playing in the final on monday night and we want to be the team this year that wins that final and represents nova scotia at the nationals whether we were 19 0 or 0 19 as long as we got in the playoffs and had a chance to win the championship thats really the goal of this team
6691435 hes our captain and he leads our back line and keeps us organized at the back he has a lot of experience and is a two time player of the year so hes been around the block
6691436 we also have dan fournier who is a defensive centre midfielder we have a really nice base of experienced players who really keep us organized and then we have all the youthful talent like mike marsh and luke corey they bring us to more of a youthful kind of style which is fast paced and all that stuff but we have those experienced guys to keep a leash on them a bit we have a great balance of experience and youth
6691437 its closer than ive ever seen it any of the four teams could definitely win it
6691438 among the four teams in the playoffs theyve all traded wins scotia beat us and we beat them and all the other teams have beaten each other too for us being in first we were maybe a bit more consistent but i dont really think that theres a favourite at all
6691439 the problem with the olympics is that they only come up every four years
6691440 thats what it comes down to our athletes have a profile for a very short time
6691441 its always hard for track and field athletes because theyre not really known in the general media the public arent really aware of them for the most part because its a big sport but its not always on the main field of what theyre looking at
6691442 the sponsors really need to see a return on their investment and theres a lot of competition with other sports
6691443 i was in every single newspaper almost every day it was ridiculous the amount of media coverage around my injury so by the time i came back from barcelona i was known everywhere in this country
6691444 sadly its not just how great an athlete you are its the profile that you have within canada do people easily recognize your name what do you represent to people
6691445 the athletes have just the minimum to do what theyre doing so sponsorship plays a really vital role
6691446 it would be wonderful to see more canadian companies taking pride in our canadian athletes
6691447 we shot 22 per cent and they doubled us in rebounding 50 25 so thats not a good formula for winning a basketball game
6691448 we came out a little bit flat and got in a hole early and never seemed to get out of it
6691449 we never got it turned around we had high expectations and i think were a better basketball team than we showed today but thats the way it goes sometimes
6691450 i didnt have any idea what was going to be a good score out here its definitely not that easy its perfect conditions youve got great weather the course is in perfect shape right now playing in the morning helped a lot the greens were a little bit more receptive
6691451 i wanted to get that out of my system and just play golf today and i did
6691452 it was a pretty tough week but you learn from your mistakes
6691453 the greens are good i mean theyre perfect perfect speed
6691454 i think you can be aggressive i was committed to my lines and made aggressive strokes
6691455 major league baseball and the media they want instant replay and were going to have instant replay so if it delays the game then theres nothing we can do about it
6691456 if somebody wants to come out and do a 1 33 theres probably nothing i can do about it
6691457 thats the good and the bad at the same time about our sport is that youre in your own lane its not a combative sport i cant reach over and knock the guy over if he starts going faster than me all i can do is try to go as fast as i can
6691458 he and his coach have prepared for this since athens finished and hes ready to go
6691459 but now that weve had time to prepare i think the biggest challenge is just making sure the rest of the guys believe in what they are capable of doing well find out how good we are as a team
6691460 were not counting on anybody right now coming in and having to be anything but a role player
6691461 after that i just think the jamaican camp went crazy
6691462 its kind of the way its been happening to me this olympics
6691463 it is up there with some of the great performances especially because she de bruijn did it at the olympics we were trying to get her stopped but shes always been a good scorer
6691464 i think the leukemia taught me to think step by step
6691465 when youre laying in the hospital bed and feeling so much pain and feeling so tired you dont want to think about next week or next month youre only thinking about the next hour
6691466 i would rather have people go out there and hit home runs than walk somebody i hate walks
6691467 i went out to the mound many times to check pitchers injuries but never for a cracked molar we needed a dentist
6691468 that was a little cubbie occurrence that was a first for me first for the umpire
6691469 major league baseball and the media they want instant replay and were going to have instant replay so if it delays the game then theres nothing we can do about it
6691470 nuri will be rather close to hong kong this afternoon and tonight with a chance of a direct hit

6691472 the airlines should have broadcast the latest typhoon news in the airport and made arrangements for us to stay somewhere its the first time ive come to hong kong and now i have no idea what to do here

6691481 i thought it had to be a hoax because it was all of a sudden
6691482 i tried to search online and find some more information when i discovered it was true it was very sad to hear
6691483 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6691484 from what i hear he was a pretty good player
6691485 i wasnt aware of it i saw him at the hall of fame and he said he was feeling fine
6691486 he looked a little thinner than usual but he never indicated to me that he was struggling with anything

6691497 cool stars 15 conference at the university of st andrews dr alan penny from the school of physics and astronomy presented results of the recovery to around 350 international delegates at the meeting in july
6691498 it was only through an innovative use of two small relatively unknown telescopes in space and a telescope in arizona that we were able to discover and follow this stars recovery so accurately
6691499 when the conventions are over will we have more momentum popularity and strategic poise than before they started or will we be caught up in massive state repression with no public support with this in mind lets deepen our roots in our communities this spring so that when we are making headlines at the conventions this summer the people around us know who we are and hear what we want from our own mouths not just the propaganda of the state
6691500 if you challenge the architects of war and poverty they call you a terrorist
6691501 i dont need a newspaper to tell me that but ok
6691502 we will go home to our communities after this summer and it is in our communities that the effects of the broadening ecological crisis the crash of the economy and the implementation of security as a way of life will take hold whether it is the right wing of capital or the left wing of capital capitalism will continue to structure our lives and dissolve every inch of autonomy we carve out to the contrary of the common narrative of defeat and despair we notice that it is also in these communities that our affects take hold it is within these circuits of support both material and emotional that we produce ourselves as powerful
6691503 good luck and have fun this is gonna be one of the most important events in years i wish i could be more involved be safe

6691573 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humor in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker

6691598 even as i hope for some measure of peace and comfort to the bereaved families i must also hope that we as a nation draw some measure of wisdom from this tragedy certain immediate lessons are clear and we must act upon those lessons decisively we need to step up security at our airports we must reexamine the effectiveness of our intelligence networks and we must be resolute in identifying the perpetrators of these heinous acts and dismantling their organizations of destruction
6691599 we must also engage however in the more difficult task of understanding the sources of such madness the essence of this tragedy it seems to me derives from a fundamental absence of empathy on the part of the attackers an inability to imagine or connect with the humanity and suffering of others such a failure of empathy such numbness to the pain of a child or the desperation of a parent is not innate nor history tells us is it unique to a particular culture religion or ethnicity it may find expression in a particular brand of violence and may be channeled by particular demagogues or fanatics most often though it grows out of a climate of poverty and ignorance helplessness and despair

6691608 he was best man at my wedding in 1975 and we were supposed to go to laos together
6691609 but they sent me to africa for two years after that i was working with him locally and internationally
6691610 it took 10 years to pull the book out of him
6691611 he never said anything about his exploits but he talked about how bravely the men fought he never had a note and could have you crying at the end it would get to the soul of the people listening
6691612 mccain staffers reported that they had received an envelope containing white powder in mccains campaign office in centennial
6691613 the staff has been quarantined and the building has been evacuated
6691614 we have put all of our offices on highest alert theyre looking for anything suspicious and all staff has been quarantined as of right now
6691615 immediately upon learning of this federal and local law enforcement officials were notified
6691616 staffs were immediately transported to a local hospital hazmat is on the scene and is looking for more information
6691617 the best i can tell you is that the letters contained a threat to those who have read it we have turned everything over to law enforcement
6691618 a call of a suspicious package containing an unknown powder that was delivered
6691619 at this time the scene has been secured and several people who may have been exposed to the substance are being examined by medical personnel
6691620 the substance is being examined to determine if it is hazardous
6691621 the message on the letter was very threatening very direct
6691622 the firemen did come in to let me know what was going on we share the same heating and air conditioning system and stuff to make sure i was safe
6691623 we intend to carry on with activities of our campaign that we have been and i believe well do that without too much further interruption

6691634 presidential elections will be held on september 6 the nomination papers can be filed from august 26
6691635 seitdem legte sie knapp 700 000 seemeilen zur ck was rund 32 erdumrundungen entspricht
6691636 wir haben unseren geburtstag verl ngert und feiern von juni bis september
6691637 die konstruktionspl ne der gerade im bau befindlichen gorch fock wurden unter dem eindruck der katastrophe berarbeitet

6691644 hey our software has automated the process of ripping people off and there is nothing you can do about it
6691645 i want to see how long it takes to get one million people to join
6691646 you know that was the beginning of a real positive change in my life
6691647 wat nu nog wordt gezien als iets voor jongeren gaat zich snel uitbreiden over meedere doelgroepen dit komt natuurlijk doordat de jongeren ouder worden maar ook door mond tot mond reclame uitbreiding van diensten van internetvideo aanbieders en de opkomst van thuisnetwerken
6691648 websites van bedrijven zijn nu hele bergen tekst de overgang naar veel meer beeld komt eraan
6691649 this is the first alternative ever proposed that has a strong economic component that has real benefits to it that could be brought to local communities
6691650 the wind potential would be destroyed if they continue with the strip mining
6691651 my father was a coal miner my grandfather was a coal miner i have two brothers that are coal miners my son in law is a coal miner
6691652 i believe that the time for coal has come and gone and i think were destroying our earth with fossil fuels thats the reason that were in the climate crisis that were in i believe that we need to start transitioning
6691653 its like living in a war zone when you have to sit in you home you hear the blasting and you breathe in the coal dust and you breathe in the rock dust
6691654 to live with your house shaking every day the foundation cracking the windows rattling it is really like living in a war zone
6691655 my husband is buried in the family cemetery next door and there are many of us like that who should not have to be driven from our homes and leave our relatives in the cemetery and have to walk away for all of that to be destroyed
6691656 its a very peaceful serene place if mountaintop removal is allowed to continue than all of that is at risk
6691657 a lot of these people have a strong sense of hopelessness
6691658 its tough to try to convince them that this is a definite possibility that this could happen
6691659 coal mining is what the politicians have based the economy on in the state of west virginia and they havent been transitioning to renewables or anything else in order to finance the state
6691660 in the state of west virginia coal is king and the politicians have shut out all other alternatives
6691661 create an atmosphere where coal river mountain becomes a publicly undesirable site for mountaintop removal
6691662 we need to raise awareness that there is a better alternative and they dont have to destroy mountains in order to create energy
6691663 the largest half year consumption decline in volume terms in the last 26 years
6691664 shell estimates that after 2015 supplies of easy to access oil and gas will no longer keep up with demand
6691665 an oil crisis is coming in the next 10 years its not a matter of demand its not a matter of supplies its both
6691666 i dont think we are going to see the supply going over 100 million barrels a day where is all that going to come from

6691674 my season is over and i was thinking about maybe coming to play in south africa on a loan deal however right now i am working on the bahludi ka kitso charity project to help kids get scholarships
6691675 it feels good to be named one of the best players in the league to me it means all my hard work during the season paid off
6691676 we started the campaign slowly but ended it strongly we could have done better during the season but things didnt go our way nonetheless thats how football is you win some and you lose some
6691677 it was natural to focus again on germany as we have very similar cultures they have strong support systems and are our biggest buyers and co productions partners in europe
6691678 regarding canada we have a co production treaty with them but the last time it was used was ten years ago for mystery harbour so we were approached by the canadian embassy in oslo and the canadian film and television production association who wanted to inject new life into the treaty

6691687 i have to progress slowly but surely i thought if i went to west ham or chievo it would have taken me a long time to adapt im here with a coach i know and it will help me grow as a player before i go to something bigger
6691688 they students attend a performing arts school for first through 12th grades for instrument dance or voice
6691689 they take regular school classes and classes in their chosen instrument it is very much the closest thing they have to the harrison school of the arts in lakeland that is why they are going there to present a concert their school in lithuania is a very prestigious school
6691690 they perform in different configurations including solos duets and the like
6691691 here they have a set program and they know who goes next with whom they all work together very well our family has stayed up late enjoying concerts in our home i dont think my piano knows what has moved in
6691692 my youngest is a violinist at florida state university and she attended the harrison school
6691693 we enjoy that kind of music so when i found out that they needed host families i volunteered
6691694 they dont have as many choices in shopping at home as we do here i guess
6691695 they really are very easy to get along with and are very comfortable in their surroundings we have a pianist and violist staying with us and together they have really entertained us
6691696 i feel extremely disillusioned that i have learnt of the suspension of one of my boxers from the media
6691697 last time i did it i felt like i did 12 rounds with mike tyson now i feel like i have done 40
6691698 it is the hardest thing i have ever done you put your body through the mill and drain everything thats inside it
6691699 my body just took control and i was on auto pilot for the last stretch i lost all feeling and the only thing i wanted to do was finish the face
6691700 i just wanted that medal so badly i just kept my arms and legs moving i cant even remember the last 800m
6691701 all i wanted to do at the end was lay down but they insisted they put me on the stretcher and make it look all dramatic
6691702 this time last year i was adamant i did not want to do this sport i just wanted to concentrate on what i was doing in the pool
6691703 latest trends in new york china indonesia and new zealand
6691704 it was unbelievable we had a scary race out there from every angle but knew we could do it
6691705 i felt good in the morning and knew that we could get the better of the swedes i had the same thing in sydney with the same guy and i knew we werent going to bottle it and we didnt
6691706 its been a killer four years and it feels great that its all behind me now and im top of the world again
6691707 to go out there and win gold with andrew my best mate of 25 years makes it so much more special we have worked so hard for it and it feels incredible to do it
6691708 words cant describe how happy we are theres never certainty but since last year we focused on nothing else but this week
6691709 i made a few little mistakes today but we pulled it back and luckily it came good for us
6691710 the preparation that i have done throughout the last four years will make the difference i am the best prepared i could possibly be
6691711 it has been a successful bit of water for the british and it is time for me to do my part in adding to those medals
6691712 lalu saya kembali ke desa dan sering bertapa di watu payung untuk meminta pertolongan kepada tuhan agar diberikan penghasilan dan kehidupan yang lebih mapan jika berhasil saya akan nanggap wayang saya kini menjadi pedagang ternak dengan 20 ekor kerbau

6691714 we had the momentum and were still in it at 1 0 down i couldnt see why the goal was disallowed but we had other chances and enough penetration
6691715 we have a policy where we have to tell the truth but no one asked her so i did and then told the umpires she had kicked it
6691716 i think this is a very big breakthrough for us as interventional cardiologists
6691717 the beauty of this as a procedure is that we dont have to open the chest
6691718 its not done under general anaesthetic and this will open the door for a whole new series of patients to able to be treated in a less invasive way
6691719 i got rather keen on exercise and i thought as soon as im fit again i might go back to the gym

6691721 frankly i think pearce has got even more speed and power than colm
6691722 compared to any of our players hes got great speed and carry and a really good ability to carry the footy
6691723 hes been very impressive i saw him kick for the first time in november when he turned up from ireland and he kicked the ball very well straight away so i thought thats a tick
6691724 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
6691725 i suppose if youve got seven maybe eight houses the economy looks fundamentally sound to you
6691726 but if youre having trouble making the mortgage payment then the economy looks awful different
6691727 i make this point not to simply give john mccain a hard time its indicative of a different world view about whats happening in america
6691728 heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
6691729 one of his biggest fundraisers helped him buy his million dollar mansion purchasing part of the property he couldnt afford
6691730 i wont comment on anything else until i introduce our running mate to the world
6691731 when asked how many houses he owns mccain lost track
6691732 when i bought the first one my husband who is not a beach person said oh this is such a waste of money the kids will never go then it got to the point where they used it so much i couldnt get in the place so i bought another one
6691733 i guess if you think that being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
6691734 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6691735 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6691736 one of his biggest fundraisers helped him buy his million dollar mansion now hes a convicted felon facing jail
6691737 boo hoo a dot com story from concept to catastrophe
6691738 currency costs fuel costs and cheap imported products that have been coming into australia unabated all have impacted to make the australian product less competitive
6691739 its my view with the right investment decisions the industry can go on and be much stronger and we can maintain a very strong industry in this country

6691751 ook een schaap in beton is een aantal jaren geleden ontvreemd
6691752 voor het graf van mijn zoon dirk elens heb ik met pasen drie jaar geleden een bloemstuk gemaakt net als voor drie andere verwanten op een dag waren ze alle vier weg nu breng ik s ochtends een bloemstuk en s avonds haal ik het weer weg
6691753 in 2004 heb ik er een zorgvuldig gekweekt dat vergt toch enkele jaren buxusplantje in de vorm van een beertje geplaatst na een paar dagen was het al verdwenen een tweede nog niet helemaal volgroeide exemplaar stond er nu twee jaar het was met een ketting onder de grond stevig vastgemaakt en toch gestolen mijn gehandicapte dochter hield zo van haar beertjes
6691754 het onderhoud en de verfraaiing van het graf vormen een eerbetoon aan onze overleden familieleden die bloemstukken en siervoorwerpen hebben een grote emotionele waarde het ontvreemden ervan raakt je dan ook heel erg
6691755 ze heeft in polen het eerste land waar ze asiel aanvroeg iets uiterst traumatisch meegemaakt met andere tsjetjenen en men had gedreigd dat haar dochters hetzelfde lot zouden ondergaan
6691756 we hebben de arts van de moeder van zes intussen een uitgebreid attest over haar gezondheidstoestand gevraagd het vorige was weinig specifiek
6691757 daarna beslist onze geneesheer of hij zelf nog een onderzoek uitvoert maar als de vrouw gezond genoeg is zal ze met haar vier andere kinderen toch terug naar polen worden gebracht
6691758 belgi was helemaal niet verplicht om de dochters terug te sturen
6691759 het dublinverdrag voorziet dat elke lidstaat om humanitaire redenen kan beslissen een asielzoeker niet door te sturen naar het land waar hij het eerst asiel heeft aangevraagd we horen trouwens vaker dat tsjetjenen in polen problemen krijgen met andere landgenoten of met russen de spanningen tussen de bevolkingsgroepen manifesteren zich daar ook in het asielland en dat is een goede reden om de aanvraag in belgi te behandelen
6691760 maar dan moet er een duidelijke reden zijn om de asielzoeker in belgi te houden dit dossier is erg onduidelijk wij weten niet wat de traumatische ervaring is

6691769 leider werden gute umgangsformen heute nicht mehr besonders ernst genommen dabei ist es doch wundersch n wenn sich m nner wie gentlemen benehmen aber da bin ich wohl ein bisschen old school
6691770 gutes benehmen hat viel mit respekt zu tun ich selbst bin ja eher eine kleine rebellin aber ich behandle andere immer mit achtung ganz besonders ltere menschen

6691777 das kommt auf den dress code an ich gehe auf sehr viele charity events da muss ich mich dann doch meist sehr gut anziehen ich liebe dolce amp gabbana und stella mccartney aber ich mag auch marc bouwers hollywood glam sehr gern

6691801 i tried to search online and find some more information when i discovered it was true it was very sad to hear
6691802 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6691803 its very important that the top players will be with us
6691804 everyone the clubs the unions the players everyone said that any updated version of the regulations has to be carved out within that the players will be released for the olympic games
6691805 they support the sevens in the olympic movement and we receive the support of all the top level players
6691806 were seeing good support from a lot of people around the world and i am surprised about that

6692046 we took a survey of readers late last year and based on the responses we received it was apparent that very few employees use the weekly print version as their primary source of campus information
6692047 as such we found it was no longer fiscally responsible for us to dedicate significant resources to this publication
6692048 we have seen the superior dedication the maurers have to health issues and the education of the next generation of health professionals
6692049 their vision to address state health issues recruit nationally known researchers and create a centralized unmc campus demonstrates their concern for public health we are delighted to honor them in this way
6692050 beverly and i have lived by the same philosophy come to work work hard and good things will happen
6692051 we are grateful to ruth and bill scott for recognizing the health needs of our state and giving so generously to unmc to address them
6692052 dr hal and beverly maurer have been a wonderful addition to the omaha community in 15 years they have profoundly influenced and made incredibly positive changes to the university of nebraska medical center in addition both hal and beverly have been involved in the community above and beyond the medical center and they deserve considerable respect for all of their accomplishments
6692053 its an exciting honor for two excellent people were very fortunate that they decided to move here and help improve our state
6692054 i have seen first hand dr maurers commitment to a healthy population and a healthy state its phenomenal that we have decided to honor he and beverly this way its a very fitting tribute
6692055 its delightful that they have named the building for hal and beverly they certainly deserve the recognition the college of public health was hals brain child and so its very appropriate that they named the building for him its recognition not only of his contributions to the college but to unmc and the state as a whole
6692056 the scotts have always been very good at spotting special talent and vision and that shows with their amazing support of dr maurer and his wife its an extraordinary tribute to the maurers that we were able to name this building for them while they are still contributing so much
6692057 hal maurer has been a major force in health promotion in nebraska and he has a particular interest in public health i think its a very appropriate honor for he and beverly to have this building named for them
6692058 this is a special and well deserved honor for dr maurer and beverly no two people have worked more diligently to improve the health of nebraskans and bolster the status of unmc
6692059 ive been witness to an amazing transformation of this campus in just the six years that ive been here and ive seen how unmc has grown in national stature largely due to many of the things dr maurer has instituted i cant think of anyone more deserving of this honor than hal and beverly
6692060 no one is more deserving of this than dr and mrs maurer ive always been amazed at their dedication to the medical center and nebraska as a whole im very happy to see them honored in this way

6692070 he went out there and risked his neck in actual negotiations
6692071 these were basically attacks intended to result in the social exclusion or humiliation of the speaker punctuated on occasion with profanity a nasty glare or even a solid punch to the arm
6692072 what did the big chimney say to the little chimney
6692073 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humor in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker
6692074 being selected as an appropriate audience for a stupid joke suggests that there is something amiss with the hearers sense of humor
6692075 i told them just go out and tell bad jokes be a hero in the field
6692076 the younger you are and the closer you are in age to your failed humorist the more likely you are to attack

6692102 ethical investment is something which each of the uks 25 000 charities that have investments should be taking very seriously it provides charities with real opportunities to further rather than counter their aims if all the 56 billion of uk charity investments was invested ethically this would send a powerful message to companies in terms of social environmental and ethical corporate behaviour
6692103 these findings come at a time when charities are coming under additional scrutiny from their supporters and face increased pressure from the charity commission to be more accountable and transparent charities should be responding to the concerns of supporters by demonstrating that they are using their finances in an ethical way
6692104 charities not investing ethically risk losing support of the public survey finds

6692112 bypassed at border inspectors arent using technology claiming laser visas cause backups at international crossings
6692113 on paper for you guys its probably a team that we should beat
6692114 theyre competitive they didnt back down i think at all in this series regardless of what their record is they are professional baseball players and they are going to give you a battle
6692115 they got some breaks and took advantage of them tonight
6692116 its a little surprising but its probably out of my jurisdiction
6692117 im not a hitter so youre probably asking the wrong guy
6692118 all of a sudden it seems like we cant get anything going
6692119 it seems like everything we do doesnt work for us i think our guys know exactly what they have to do and they know how many games we have left and they know where were at and they know what we have to do to win i think were definitely trying
6692120 they wales assessed him and said that they could push him through but as it is a friendly it seems a bit silly at this stage
6692121 everyone is fit except jason price and darren who is probably a game away from contention
6692122 jason joined in with training but tweaked his medial ligaments so couldnt play on tuesday
6692123 this crime is a particularly unpalatable one its motivated simply by greed
6692124 she said she didnt want him to suffer but he was going to turf them out and wasnt treating them as his own children
6692125 but unpleasant relationships are in no way an excuse for what occurred
6692126 all of his bodily functions went down so they have to build them up again
6692127 hes also got a fungal infection on his skin but its got into his blood supply and poisoned his blood
6692128 he was bleeding in the stomach and had to have a bit of an operation last week so as long as this sort of thing is going on hes still in a critical condition
6692129 he used to have a plump round face and its a gaunt looking face now
6692130 he asked me are the lions in the top eight so i got that bit
6692131 i could no longer study because i dont have a social security number so
6692132 bypassed at border inspectors arent using technology claiming laser visas cause backups at international crossings
6692133 uk governments sustainable procurement and carbon emissions delivery plan announced
6692134 i want him just to go out there and be himself and have the composure that hes always had and throw strikes
6692135 if somebody hits the ball hard keep working keep working on what he does best thats how hes been doing it for a year and a half now
6692136 its like hitters in a slump its just something that pitchers go through where all of a sudden you are trying to pitch away from contact
6692137 i dont know why it happens its just something im going to be really conscious of going out there tonight attacking the strike zone getting ahead getting strike one and strike two and making them hit my pitch instead of falling behind 2 0 and obviously they know a fastball is coming
6692138 i think its very important that you have to show a lot of confidence in him
6692139 if you look hes been real good for us because hes gotten hit a few games doesnt mean that i have to show that im concerned about him
6692140 i just know i need to make every start possible wherever it lines up it lines up i think the matchups are more for the playoffs than anything during the season matchups are pretty irrelevant because you play teams so often and because we have five guys who i believe every single one will get the job done
6692141 when i got into coaching i always dreamed of getting to the nba this opportunity was unbelievable
6692142 you travel youre in the gym youre working with everybody a lot of times im going to be working with some of the younger guys its developing guys that theyre investing millions of dollars in
6692143 he is one of the games bright young coaches and made a great impact on our program
6692144 we will miss him but its always exciting when a member of our staff has the chance to pursue their dream and this opportunity in houston allows brett to do that
6692145 theres no up side to being adversarial in these kind of deals youve just got to stay positive and youve got to focus on whos here and have trust and faith in the people that are working on getting everything done
6692146 no one gets 100 percent of what they would like to happen but me and my agent are happy

6692154 i feel people should get off our back and realize theres some parity in this game
6692155 never in my wildest dreams would i have thought i would have scored the goal that gave us the gold medal
6692156 i told her a number of times that she is by far the best goalkeeper in the world
6692157 that game today is leaving people now scratching their heads about her
6692158 most of the goal was open to my left so i started leaning to my left but marta tried shooting to the right
6692159 it was a reaction save but thats what i get paid for
6692160 i just knew i had to keep it low and hit it hard it went in
6692161 if it wasnt for her there would definitely have been some goals in the back of the net
6692162 we continue to put ourselves in position day in and day out to win games
6692163 we have a good team we have good chemistry a lot of things are really working in our favor right now
6692164 it was a big win for us were really confident weve been able to find a way to win ballgames that is something we werent doing early in the year
6692165 doubleplay wed get wright at second too he had taken off he was halfway home cant fault him i mean ball gets in the lights you cant see it
6692166 we just have to continue playing good baseball and let things happen the way they have been happening
6692167 i dont want fans to get on him for my situation
6692168 off a slow pace like that you cant be surprised when these girls come up on you you have to be ready to go and i didnt have it to go
6692169 coming off the curve i was actually in a pretty good position she said
6692170 it actually really opened up thats whats so disappointing i saw daylight and really went backwards instead of staying up and staying loose i got tight and that was it
6692171 the olympics in front of thousands i wanted it really bad
6692172 maybe im just not as fit as i thought i was she said
6692173 yeah i got nothing else going on so why not
6692174 they always bring up michigan it kind of gets annoying
6692175 we didnt win a ring off of michigan after that we went through a whole season luckily we had our heads on straight
6692176 a lot of these guys were in the dominican and venezuelan summer leagues they want to grow fast and a related factor is that when they get here theyre generally younger than the guys theyre competing with most of whom were drafted out of college so sometimes they look for a shortcut but there are no shortcuts
6692177 we continue to talk about in detail to prospects its like pfp pitchers fielding practice repeat repeat repeat i think we also have to make sure we have bilingual doctors in latin america who understand the commissioners drug policy
6692178 i would rather lose a game than take a chance of hurting anybody
6692179 you cant stress enough that the hero stuff sometimes works in the world but it doesnt work here
6692180 just like this happened with some questionable home run calls something else will happen a play at first a play at second its not going to end its like pandoras box be careful what you wish for
6692181 i dont care if were on a 50 game trip
6692182 you have to be fired up to go out there and play these games because they mean something
6692183 good news is theres nothing wrong with my eyesight the bad news is i just flat out stink right now
6692184 id have probably had him get rid of it the first day
6692185 but then i wouldnt have been there the next day
6692186 its a different era an altogether different era from when i managed six teams from 1967 to 1988
6692187 he has gotten ownership to do some things that did not take place not just for me but for the ones before me
6692188 the ownership made a commitment from top to bottom to put more into it and theyre getting better results
6692189 im telling people the stick had a mind of its own
6692190 it was my fault i take full blame for it
6692191 i felt it hit my hand but i dont think it was in all the way before i grabbed and then when i went to grab he had already let go
6692192 ive never dropped a stick in my life its kind of upsetting
6692193 the 400 meters is a race about confidence heart intelligence and you cant back down
6692194 and thats why i have this medal around my neck right now
6692195 a couple of years ago i was able to buy everything practically new
6692196 you just have to do some things different to adjust
6692197 weve seen an increase in terms of clothes school supplies broken in sports gear its a great way to get brand name styles for cheaper
6692198 its not just the working poor were also seeing more middle class families coming to us
6692199 parents would go naked before they would send their kids to school without the right tools to be able to get an education
6692200 you dont want a child to feel embarrassed or left out
6692201 thats not a good way to start the school year
6692202 gas alone is making me rethink a whole lot of things it looks like well have to do fewer projects or just come up with another creative way to do them
6692203 she said she cant have a regular calculator it has to have different functions on it
6692204 you make sure that the teacher understands whats going on so they dont penalize them
6692205 i know for a fact people like me are going to have a hard time
6692206 i dont want to eat the meat because i love the animals i love the animals
6692207 i swim around on my back and do cute little human things with my hands

6692219 we thought about all the security detail and all of the stuff shed have to worry about and we just wanted her to focus she knew we loved her and she took that to beijing thats good enough for me
6692220 we cant wait to see her i mean they are already talking about doing something big in town
6692221 its unbelievable i mean as a parent this is something you dream about happening to your child so this really is a dream come true
6692222 its been great people have been riding by honking and waving and we have been on the phone much of the day with family and friends
6692223 everyone has been so nice and really appreciative of what carli has done its almost like a personal victory for the town
6692224 the first thing i thought to myself after watching her score that goal was i told you
6692225 so when she texted me after the game to thank me i told you was my only reply
6692226 i said come home relax and get ready to build a better you
6692227 she wants to be the best player in the world and we are still striving to get to that point
6692228 were capable of hitting weve hit for the last 3 1 2 years and have a lot of the same guys i know we can hit but i cant tell you when its going to get going i think every guy in that room knows we can play better
6692229 i think our guys know exactly what they have to do
6692230 they know where we are at how many games we have to go and what we need to do to win
6692231 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6692232 i was not expecting anything like this i thought it was going to be a few girls from the gym and coaches
6692233 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6692234 obviously this is a place that i held near and dear to my heart
6692235 i wasnt very happy to leave under the circumstances that i left
6692236 wherever ive been throughout the world and even overseas ive had people comment about the philly days they are always saying you should have never left that team and different things in that nature i told my wife why not go back why not come back to philly because i had great years there we met there got married there and started our life there
6692237 being that senior guy that guy that can do a little something on the court to be able to provide extra help off the bench
6692238 thats one of the things that some of the veterans always told me dont leave before youre ready to leave leave on your own terms dont leave before youre ready to leave because once you leave youre done its not going to be around anymore
6692239 i still feel like i have enough capabilities to be out on the floor to be able to help a team that is fighting to try to get to playoffs and make some noise i still get that urge it rejuvenated when i got back to detroit being in that situation being around a great organization
6692240 good news is theres nothing wrong with my eyesight the bad news is i just flat out stink right now
6692241 id have probably had him get rid of it the first day
6692242 but then i wouldnt have been there the next day
6692243 its a different era an altogether different era from when i managed six teams from 1967 to 1988
6692244 time for a change we are the people we can do it

6692294 bypassed at border inspectors arent using technology claiming laser visas cause backups at international crossings
6692295 we have a ways to go but were a lot closer today than we have been and were seeing the results
6692296 were at a 10 year low right now with apprehensions
6692297 i have to were not changing generals in the middle of the war thats what they do over in iraq every other week theres a new damn general over there
6692298 were going to be here and were going to see this through and then well see where the chips fall but im not leaving until we have a deal
6692299 weve begun already talking about the succession process prior to this well continue along those lines that weve already been on and will identify those individuals and hopefully well come up with that one person who will be able to lead us and bring us even further than we are right now
6692300 youre talking about a man whos left behind an incredible legacy from where we started at way back in the day to where it is today with what the league is bringing in dollarwise and all the player benefits and different things gene has had a hand in hes left this organization in a very very good place
6692301 weve learned in the nfl that not everybody is the enemy
6692302 we all have to work together if we have prosperity we have to keep the peace not make war
6692303 paul and i have had discussions about how people perceive us
6692304 we have a relationship where we can just sit down and talk without even talking about business we can talk about the history of the game about what hes been through what ive been through
6692305 all of those things are why weve had success paul and i always tried to look at everything from each others perspective if we know what the common good is we know where we have to go its never been about either one of us trying to one up the other its always been about what can we do to make our product better and grow it if people dont understand that thats their problem not ours
6692306 few people in the history of the nfl have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6692307 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6692308 the position he took of creating a partnership with the owners and getting a meaningful majority of the gross revenues and then focusing on building the revenue pot to raise the boat of all the players was absolutely right it was a total win for everybody its hard to imagine there are many people who wouldve been in his position and had the foresight to think of this as an option
6692309 but i never got the chance i ended up coming here to the nflpa
6692310 but thats ok its not going to stop me from doing what i have to do but it does enter the picture from time to time they dont want to accept that i can do this job its always a little tougher
6692311 i just hope that lto chief suansing can back up his claims with facts because as far as i know the lto is the only government agency that sells issues and distributes all vehicle plates including security plates and protocol plates
6692312 he should name names and present proofs this is a very serious allegation and if he is claiming facts and not speculations then the house is prepared to discipline our members
6692313 and as far i know it is the lto that sells these security plates protocol plates and diplomatic plates to unauthorized vehicle owners im really glad that lto chief suansing opened this up because now we have a basis to conduct an investigation
6692314 there are even vehicles that are practically junked which have passed road worthiness testing by the lto you dont even need to look far and wide to discover these rackets because in our major highways alone you can see buses trucks and jeepneys that emit thick black smoke but have managed to pass through smoke emission testing and were registered at the lto

6692407 the freedom of information act has been an important tool in bridging the information gap that existed to allow americans to make more informed decisions about the costs of war in iraq and afghanistan
6692408 this situation was a classic clear example of many of the issues brought out by these records
6692409 here all those involved were reservists from a unit in ohio there were communications problems between iraqis and u s soldiers there is the possibility soldiers were not properly trained and it is a high risk situation
6692410 the unit was already under other investigations for incidents involving torture of iraqis using taser and stun guns
6692411 u s forces have great difficulty effectively communication with iraqi civilians in a wide variety of contexts whether at traffic control points in areas where local nationals are denied entry or when making sweeps of homes looking for insurgents or weapons
6692412 often times soldiers are operating with barely remembered not well pronounced phrases in arabic taught months back this is a very dangerous thing
6692413 the low percentage of svbeid with the high percentage of escalation of force incidents that injure or kill local nationals
6692414 i hope that there records are in fact indicating that somewhere along the line people are realizing that force self protection is one thing but you have to consider the civilian population at all times
6692415 counterinsurgency requires long training and different kinds of training it is important to recognize that the civilian population is critical to success you fail with them and you fail with your insurgency population
6692416 these records indicate that yes people were in danger but our forces should have been taking a lot more measures and worked even harder to reduce civilian deaths

6692453 so its kind of like it wraps as it rotates

6692455 its kind of like a very very bad day for earth
6692456 scientists say if it did impact the earth it would carry the force of 110 000 hiroshima bombs

6692655 she hated her first husband because he was so domineering i think she was ashamed she hated hitler and didnt really want to talk about the tryst once it was out there
6692656 i think she reluctantly told me because i asked about the cigarette case and immediately regretted it
6692657 she said that she tried to tell movie mogul louis b meyer about hitler and he said he didnt want to talk about hitler and he told her not to talk about hitler i bet she didnt tell anyone except me

6692682 al ahly is the only star and if a player feels he is better than the team then he doesnt have any place in my squad if the board tells me that a certain player is a star and needs a special treatment then id have to leave so this player can stay
6692683 i just order them to cure the player quickly so he can be ready for matches and thats what they try to do

6692685 amir knows who is number one and about ramzy ahmed nagy the best goalkeeping coach in africa is convinced with his form and i trust his opinion
6692686 amir has made mistakes but we trust his abilities and potential fans must be patient about him and he must help himself by learning from mistakes and trying not to repeat them
6692687 i dont have any comment about the work of anyone
6692688 i give them eight players and sometimes eleven and they punish us by giving sending them late
6692689 the derby match has certain traditions and it requires more concentration than other matches because a win gives happiness to fans right away in my four year reign i have won all my matches against zamalek except one in which i played with the reserve team after winning the league
6692690 zamalek has changed many coaches but dont change their performance their players always enter the derby match with fear and that gives confidence to our players
6692691 the qualification is hard especially as we have two matches on artificial grass but we want to qualify and that is what we will do
6692692 with the olympics coming to a close mondays preview opening will bring a new opportunity to help those in need especially by bringing smiles to the children

6692699 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6692700 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people
6692701 the average household has its tv on for eight hours and 14 minutes daily thats a record
6692702 if it hadnt been for simran i wouldnt like to think what wouldve happened
6692703 she likes sitting there glued to the tv i do moan at her but this time its done some good
6692704 i woke my mum and told her what was happening i watched the cat in the hat and was crawling on the floor i told my mum to crawl on the floor too
6692705 we shut the door so the smoke didnt get into the room
6692706 for a girl of her age to not only know what to do but to put that into action in a situation where your house is filling with smoke its really quite remarkable

6692713 two of the silliest pieces i have read on ya literature in ages
6692714 heres an idea why doesnt everyone just grow up and stop talking about this and let teens read what they want whether a publisher designates it ya or not
6692715 i really have a problem with this book it shouldnt be on the shortlist let alone win

6692718 well weve established that the vanagon isnt exactly a race car
6692719 ruby dont drive your air cooled vanagon westfalia to town
6692720 id investigate whether a porsche or subaru boxer engine might fit
6692721 i mean how cool is it when your everyday transportation can double as an apartment
6692722 its the moment athletes have trained for so long and hes making history
6692723 its not like a thing you have planned or you have rehearsed usain is such a relaxed guy thats his way of expressing himself to say ive done something that nobody else has done
6692724 we cannot tell a guy whos run 9 69 seconds how he needs to react
6692725 he is a young man but he should show more respect for his rivals that would be more in the spirit of the olympic ideal
6692726 he should shake hands with them after the finish line however he is only 21 and he will learn it would be good not to have a repeat of the catch me if you can gesture
6692727 usain has huge respect for jacques rogge but there is absolutely no chance usain would ever be disrespectful to other athletes

6692741 the plane was rocking back and forth until i suspected it was going to fall
6692742 i saw people smoke explosions i think that is what woke me up because i had lost consciousness
6692743 i thought that if help did not arrive soon i would die
6692744 the plane would not fail to the point of causing a tragedy
6692745 gee that was a monumentally bad idea i wont do that again
6692746 traffic will be severely disrupted between 09 00 when the march is expected to start and 15 00 on friday

6692750 people think im not an actress but acting is my passion people think if a model does nude scenes it is because they are desperate for an acting career but its not the case i chose to play in the film and i stand by my choice
6692751 nuri will be rather close to hong kong this afternoon and tonight with a chance of a direct hit
6692752 it may be necessary to issue higher signals this afternoon
6692753 the airlines should have broadcast the latest typhoon news in the airport and made arrangements for us to stay somewhere its the first time ive come to hong kong and now i have no idea what to do here
6692754 we are fortunate that the competition finished before typhoon nuri hit hong kong
6692755 i wont comment on anything else until i introduce our running mate to the world
6692756 a partner with me in strengthening this economy for the middle class and working families
6692757 i want somebody whos independent somebody who can push against my preconceived notions and challenge me so we have got a robust debate in the white house
6692758 its been a tough first half which has been severely affected by concern over the state of the us financial market and its consequences
6692759 cpix for july should begin to reflect the steep rise in electricity prices as this will have been included in the survey
6692760 we expect that cpix will continue to rise until the new inflation basket is introduced in jan 2009
6692761 the household component of the credit number is particularly important as consumers try and smooth their consumption across the inflation cycle despite higher rates
6692762 we look for still robust growth there of 14 5 year on year
6692763 south africas trade figures have been remarkably benign in recent months but with large imports such as oil typically lumpy this may be about to change
6692764 this recognition from inc is a tribute to the loyalty of our more than 25 000 customers in 140 countries around the world as well as the tireless efforts and dedication of the ibfx team
6692765 being named a member of the inc 500 and more specifically attaining the 5th spot in the financial services category is a great honor we look forward to continuing to raise the bar for 2009 and beyond
6692766 if the deal is implemented china will have the ability to produce solid fuel rocket engines for various purposes and will become a competitor for russia on the world missile technology market

6692771 it got me pretty square then i had to go toward first base but i had to get the out as bad as it hurt i just went after it and was able to make the play
6692772 when we came inside i said im going to take my shirt off and give everybody high fives
6692773 ive got a lot of confidence especially with the guys hitting out there and playing defense behind me the way they are
6692774 ive been able to get down in the zone low and get a lot of ground balls and strikeouts
6692775 the sinker had great action the changeup was really good tonight
6692776 it just has such action down below the hitting area out of the hand it looks like a good pitch to hit and you have to commit
6692777 ahh mba kalo aku jadi ka joe aku bakal lakuin hal yang sama itu aja biasa ko mba
6692778 its now clear that the economy will be the tipping point in this election
6692779 and the candidate who has the best answer to getting america growing again without inflation is going to tap the winning segment of this electorate
6692780 i like johns ideas but he has more to do in terms of making his case and connecting with voters on the economy
6692781 but has he effectively conveyed those policies in a way that votes will understand thats the challenge for his campaign
6692782 we continue to put ourselves in position day in and day out to win games
6692783 we have a good team we have good chemistry a lot of things are really working in our favor right now
6692784 it was a big win for us were really confident weve been able to find a way to win ballgames that is something we werent doing early in the year
6692785 double play wed get wright at second too he had taken off he was halfway home cant fault him i mean ball gets in the lights you cant see it
6692786 we just have to continue playing good baseball and let things happen the way they have been happening
6692787 i might have an opportunity to be out there one more time in september before this place goes but itll definitely hold a special place in my memories in my baseball career
6692788 lose a ball in the lights it costs you a ballgame a little flip to first base costs you a ballgame
6692789 my husband learned that i do not need to be talked to when im fishing i like to concentrate and catch a fish
6692790 my husband and son awoke and had lines wet in the skokomish river at nearly 4 a m by mid afternoon they called and begged me to get off work early to join them i had no clothes and had to drive an hour out of my way before making the 1 5 hour drive to meet up with them i work in yelm
6692791 the bank was wall to wall anglers where was i going to squish in i am a newbie at fishing and worry about others standing so close but i also love to catch fish and want to stand my ground so i pushed my way in between a group of men
6692792 so i told the boys it was not on shore yet
6692793 theyve all come here for a reason and now theyve come here with their biggest enabler whether thats their parents or their partner
6692794 contestants wont just be facing their weight issues but also the other issues in their lives
6692795 we always look to reinvent the show and one of the things that kept coming up in feedback and message boards was that it starts at home
6692796 so many of these weight issues start when youre a child or when you get married because you get comfortable and the pressures of life take over
6692797 we thought both of those situations had incredibly interesting dynamics and it really has raised the bar from what we see on an emotional level from these families because it literally is all or nothing for some of them
6692798 they complement each other i think their dedication to the contestants goes far beyond what we ever expected i think people really feel that bob and jillian are speaking to them even if theyre not on the ranch with them
6692799 time for a change we are the people we can do it
6692800 melanie brown in a bejeweled black gown chatted with actress
6692801 this is the first election where ive actually paid attention to every single thing and i think its because im a mom now
6692802 i just think barack is amazing i admire him i admire michelle
6692803 i think hes inspirational and thats what this country needs right now
6692804 desire for change on earmarks and our commitment to get it done
6692805 funding will send your tax dollars back to be used in your neighborhood where it belongs
6692806 not every earmark is bad but my goodness they ought to pass the straight face test
6692807 all of his bodily functions went down so they have to build them up again
6692808 hes also got a fungal infection on his skin but its got into his blood supply and poisoned his blood
6692809 he was bleeding in the stomach and had to have a bit of an operation last week so as long as this sort of thing is going on hes still in a critical condition
6692810 he used to have a plump round face and its a gaunt looking face now
6692811 he asked me are the lions in the top eight so i got that bit
6692812 hes faced danger on a number of occasions but hes never been in trouble like this before
6692813 we are thrilled to feature new programs from all of the major broadcast networks and a major premium network
6692814 this crime is a particularly unpalatable one its motivated simply by greed
6692815 she said she didnt want him to suffer but he was going to turf them out and wasnt treating them as his own children
6692816 but unpleasant relationships are in no way an excuse for what occurred
6692817 this is not supposed to be self congratulatory i am congratulating you
6692818 the president should also be reminded that in the emergency supplemental bill signed into law in june his administration pressured the house of representatives to strip 15 million from the restoration of jackson barracks the backdrop for todays visit
6692819 also cut due to the white house veto threat was 157 5 million for six new orleans area hospitals 50 million for crime prevention 75 million to help accelerate closure of mrgo and 5 million for a cameron parish waste water system
6692820 he takes her away to a beach house and confronts her
6692821 of course she turns it around youre the one who always walks away thats not true zach is just trying to be a family man thats a new thing for him but kendall is all ryan this aidan that and that is not working for zach
6692822 with kendall its always what ryan needs zach says well what about what we need as a family its not an ultimatum its just getting to the point where hes going to have to say if you need to be with all these other people then maybe we have to take a harder look at you and me why do
6692823 kendalls problem is that she wants everyone to like her
6692824 i dont think she really wants to be with ryan but she cant handle the fact that ryan has moved on from her
6692825 if you want to be with greenlee go be with greenlee if you want to be with annie be with annie youre not in high school anymore youve got kids theres a lot to think about
6692826 sex is always good but it doesnt fix the problems zach is tired of just being kendalls husband its not enough he used to have casinos and big companies
6692827 zach says to her its only us thats all we have
6692828 are you serious ive never been mistaken for a hooker before do we look like prostitutes
6692829 your dress is going to look pretty hot on dougs floor tomorrow morning id totally do you hey o
6692830 so what have you been doing the past four years of your life
6692831 if we together dont work for finding ways to take away the obstacles of legal downloads then this industry from a digital perspective is going to die
6692832 had we only done music we wouldnt have done this
6692833 the way it is set up today very few people apart from the record industry are getting rich on digital music generally speaking the music today isnt generating a boat load of cash for us
6692834 oh it was bad it was drugs drinking stupid things that you do
6692835 you know ive been asking when we were going to get things going our way
6692836 things never seemed to go our way but now i think this is the right time were catching breaks but were fighting for those breaks too
6692837 weve been able to find a way to win ballgames and we werent doing that early in the year the good teams do that
6692838 even if we get behind we know we can win
6692839 something that strikes my heart very closely is the parents and their kids and how parents take responsibility for being the role model that brought their child to this point
6692840 seeing how they deal with okay i am part of why you are here i am part of the problem now lets both be part of the solution obviously emotions run high and these feelings go extremely deep it creates an interesting environment
6692841 it is frustrating and upsetting to welcome these people to campus and realize how little they know when the information is out there
6692842 eh pai voi astea fara prieten nu intelegeti cum este
6692843 i got lucky i hit a ball into the lights in that situation i havent faced the guy vladimir nu ez before i dont think
6692844 but i know that he usually keeps the ball down and away so i wanted to stay there i hit a changeup and hit it pretty good and caught a break there
6692845 its natural to look up there were not going to play that game
6692846 i didnt think he hit it as hard as he did
6692847 he got on his front foot and he kind of flicked it to left i thought it was going to get down

6692855 with all due respect a system that requires an insane person to first make a substantial showing of his own lack of mental capacity without the assistance of counsel or a mental health expert in order to obtain such assistance is by definition an insane system
6692856 he very easily went along with whoever wanted to accept him thats why he ended up in bad company
6692857 he didnt know how to process information the way other people do
6692858 he didnt know how to plan he didnt know how to put things together he loved to fish but he couldnt plan for fresh water versus salt water his solution was to bring everything
6692859 we will conduct a comprehensive review of all our programmes

6692862 i didnt realise that there was so much to learn and it came as a big shock when tony and kevin started talking on the first day of training
6692863 living clean is a fantastic opportunity for me i can use my existing skills and experience in the cleaning industry but instead of doing the cleaning myself i will be training and managing my own team
6692864 i can also run by business from home which is ideal for my children whilst i am committed to developing my business i want to be around for them as much as possible
6692865 the great thing about franchising is that you are not starting completely from scratch on your own i have the reassurance that living clean is already a successful growing brand i also have the ongoing support of julie and her team which i know will be vital most importantly i can build something for my future and that of my kids

6692904 borrowers use all available credit card and overdraft facilities and draw on their mortgage facilities or obtain a second bond they use up savings withdraw money market investments and sell shares they borrow from family and microlenders and explore consolidation options if they have fixed property for security
6692905 start defaulting on debt are erratic about paying municipal services and rent miss premiums on insurance policies or surrender them fall behind in school fee payments cellphone and store accounts and then start pawning jewellery and electronic goods
6692906 we really need to change the way we do business
6692907 the very purpose of this agree ment is to bind together the part nership between local and national govern ment to provide a sustainable and pros perous future for the shetland community and on behalf of the council i whole heartedly commit to delivering our part of this historic agreement along with the continued support of our community planning partners
6692908 go ahead with most of the projects in the way that we want
6692909 in the old days most of the money you got from central government was ring fenced but this new system is actually saying heres the money its up to local authorities to decide how best to spend it on services for the community
6692910 the challenge is that the services provided are fair and that we take a long term view on investment
6692911 my hobby horse is transport links in shetland from outlying areas and the remote islands places like unst and yell and i do think that investment needs a long term view we have to be inclusive of all the areas its a huge investment but the payback on that only comes over a long period of time
6692912 the soa we are signing today puts the sic along with the other 31 local authorities in scotland at the heart of local democracy
6692913 the soa reduces unnecessary reporting and monitoring and allows the local authority and their com munity planning partners to deliver the services people want and need
6692914 but we are treading very carefully in respect to the environmental agreements we signed in this regard
6692915 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6692916 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6692917 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6692918 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6692919 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6692920 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6692921 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6692922 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6692923 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6692924 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6692925 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6692926 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6692927 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6692928 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6692929 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6692930 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6692931 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6692932 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6692933 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6692934 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6692935 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6692936 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6692937 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6692938 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6692939 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6692940 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6692941 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6692942 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6692943 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6692944 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6692945 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6692946 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6692947 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6692948 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6692949 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6692950 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6692951 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6692952 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6692953 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6692954 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6692955 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6692956 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6692957 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6692958 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6692959 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6692960 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6692961 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6692962 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6692963 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6692964 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6692965 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6692966 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6692967 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6692968 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6692969 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6692970 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6692971 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6692972 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6692973 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6692974 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6692975 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6692976 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6692977 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6692978 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6692979 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6692980 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6692981 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6692982 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6692983 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6692984 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6692985 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6692986 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6692987 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6692988 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6692989 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6692990 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta

6692994 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6692995 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6692996 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6692997 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6692998 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6692999 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6693000 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6693001 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6693002 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6693003 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6693004 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6693005 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6693006 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6693007 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6693008 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6693009 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6693010 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6693011 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6693012 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6693013 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6693014 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6693015 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6693016 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6693017 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6693018 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6693019 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6693020 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6693021 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6693022 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6693023 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6693024 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6693025 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6693026 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6693027 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6693028 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6693029 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6693030 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6693031 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6693032 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6693033 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6693034 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6693035 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6693036 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6693037 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6693038 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6693039 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6693040 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6693041 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6693042 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
6693043 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
6693044 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6693045 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6693046 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6693047 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6693048 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6693049 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo

6693052 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
6693053 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6693054 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6693055 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6693056 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6693057 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6693058 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6693059 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6693060 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
6693061 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
6693062 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6693063 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6693064 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6693065 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6693066 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6693067 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6693068 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa

6693074 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6693075 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6693076 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

6693100 fails to give assurances that current laws about abortion will not be stretched to cover birth control
6693101 nothing in the new regulation in any way changes a patients right to any legal procedure
6693102 its about abortion and conscience it is very closely focused on abortion and physicians conscience
6693103 this regulation does not limit patient access to health care but rather protects any individual health care provider or institution from being compelled to participate in or from being punished for refusal to participate in a service that for example violates their conscience

6693146 in terms of sheer enthusiasm commitment and perseverance idris always goes the extra mile
6693147 i suggested the idea for a year long project having seen it work elsewhere its a good way of getting information to people and reducing the stigma around these subjects particularly men
6693148 we are here to listen and talk this is the way forward talking to people in their own yard we really want to give people alternatives projects like this can breathe new life into green lanes haringey and hackney
6693149 in the indian markets along devon avenue in the sparkling new mosque in the southwestern suburbs in an armenian wedding and a filipino ball
6693150 i serve as a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views
6693151 before shuffling inside and closing the latch i thought him a kindred spirit
6693152 this election is not about me this campaign is about you
6693153 he did not want to be a negro writer it is a crass disjunction but it is not his crassness or his disjunction we give lip service to the idea of the writer who happens to be black but had anyone in the postwar era ever seen such a thing
6693154 we love the show thats what motivated him to go ahead and try to be on it
6693155 dan is more of the action guy and andrew is more of a thinker a little more low key but very funny in his own way
6693156 they pretty much were trying to show the producers who they were what kind of people they were
6693157 i wasnt surprised when they sent in the video i was surprised when they called back and wanted another one they get thousands of videos for this show and i thought hed never hear back from them
6693158 we werent allowed to know where he was how long he was in the race we were called by producers just to let us know that he was safe and that he wasnt harmed and was healthy
6693159 were going to have to watch the show like everyone else
6693160 for someone in wilmington to be in this show i think is a really cool thing for delaware
6693161 hopefully people will be rooting for dan knowing that hes a delaware boy born and bred
6693162 we had a great tradition at sanford in athletics and that was my foundation for my competitive spirit
6693163 we had no hope of anything happening the way it did
6693164 we just wanted to say we did it i dont like to not try things
6693165 i knew that they would not be interested in a scripted thing with music and all that sort of stuff i knew that we should just sell our unique personalities
6693166 we took them on a tour of the fraternity house and then we went to a bar in tempe ariz
6693167 andrew was trying to put his moves on a girl and we had a video of him getting absolutely shot down it wasnt set up at all we just asked a random girl he was using these lame pick up lines and i was just looking at him like what are you doing you couldnt have scripted that
6693168 theres definitely tension between the two of them while theyre making decisions during the race
6693169 you have to know danny to know danny but when danny gets his mind on something he can accomplish whatever he wants and danny loves traveling
6693170 its very exciting not knowing what lies ahead of you what kind of culture youre going to be seeing
6693171 the surprise was so much fun i just wanted to start so badly i had so much adrenaline
6693172 so again he was on the opposite side of the spectrum from me
6693173 and 30 pounds sounds like a lot but i didnt have anything else to do while i was waiting i was literally going to the gym every day it was real easy for me to be motivated by this kind of experience how can you not be
6693174 youre in so many social situations where youd love to bring up the topic and you cant i was very mentally disciplined and i lied i made up a complete story about where i was i told people i was doing habitat for humanity in the suburbs of mexico city
6693175 they cant believe my face is plastered across the cbs web site and im going to be in this its just complete and utter shock and disbelief
6693176 the important thing for me was to go about my life in a normal capacity
6693177 i got this job at the grand hyatt in washington about five weeks ago its a really good opportunity to be with a good company in a good city and i feel fortunate to have landed the position
6693178 they never told you what to say theres so many times you forget that cameras are in your face the adrenaline is going youre just trying to get to this place as fast as possible
6693179 we werent allowed to know where he was how long he was still in the race we were called by producers just letting us know that he was safe and he was ok
6693180 not only would it be unfair to cbs to say something but it also would be unfair to myself and everyone else it would be like watching a football game on tv when you already know the score i want people to go into it blindly
6693181 i like trying things to see what happens if you dont try you never know
6693182 i tried my best if it wasnt good enough so be it
6693183 no one gives a shit what you had for lunch
6693184 the first thing steve and i do every morning once we have the coffee made
6693185 thanks for sharing and making the world a better place

6693191 i may just be a small drop in this vast universe but to my loved ones i am their universe
6693192 if you aim at nothing you will hit it every time
6693193 all of his bodily functions went down so they have to build them up again
6693194 hes also got a fungal infection on his skin but its got into his blood supply and poisoned his blood
6693195 he was bleeding in the stomach and had to have a bit of an operation last week so as long as this sort of thing is going on hes still in a critical condition
6693196 he used to have a plump round face and its a gaunt looking face now
6693197 he asked me are the lions in the top eight so i got that bit
6693198 presidential elections will be held on september 6 the nomination papers can be filed from august 26
6693199 he has received an offer that fulfils a career dream for him
6693200 bill has made significant contributions during his career with ford motor company and we wish him and his family all the best with his future endeavour
6693201 a lot of people dont understand what just happened in the darkroom best to keep it to ourselves
6693202 his character has consistently declared itself from 1970 up until the last offence of 2002 to be deliberate persistent planned and premeditated behaviour
6693203 the offender over many years has displayed a deviate sexual interest in under aged boys and has failed to acknowledge it
6693204 behold he is in thy hand only spare his life

6693214 were going to try our hardest not to be violent
6693215 for large spacecraft this is done with mechanical louvers basically glorified window blinds that open and close to allow in or reflect heat
6693216 but as satellites get smaller these systems get too heavy and bulky
6693217 weve used thermal insulation similar to what youd find in a fridge and were finding that we need better ways than purely insulating layers to make sure that our spacecraft maintain the right temperature
6693218 there are lots of ways to cool and heat things but they all tend to be complicated and require power and could potentially break down
6693219 something very simple like this requiring minimal power and with minimal mechanical things to go wrong could be quite a useful thing to put on small spacecraft
6693220 it looks like these things are a product that we could take off the shelf and apply to our spacecraft
6693221 his variation seems unreal he could snare 500 wickets by the time people are able to figure him out

6693223 after range trading for the first four months of the year property stocks tracked the decline in financial stocks as growing worries about inflation interest rates and recession dogged the market
6693224 but the activity of short selling in the sector is at the root of the unprecedented volatility we are now seeing
6693225 the property sector as a whole is not very liquid especially in the small and mid cap names which are exposed to higher leverage or development
6693226 they have been the target of some aggressive and indiscriminate shorting in the long run such volatility is not a concern but it is certainly unsettling in the short term
6693227 share prices are likely to reflect capital market concerns rather than the fundamentals of tenant demand and security of income
6693228 it is fair to assume that pricing will overshoot on the downside just as it overshot on the way up
6693229 however one only knows where the bottom was in retrospect

6693249 im thrilled to be one of the only stores to carry this online gaming for the greater society book release
6693250 we stocked our shelves with double the normal number of first editions for this major online gaming for the greater society biographical novel release
6693251 and we expect to sell out very fast mildred xiongs online gaming for the greater society book brought hundreds of pre sale orders and numerous bulk order requests so the question of whether or not well sell out is moot
6693252 in the literary world we seek to heighten public awareness about the online gaming for the greater society industry and how it works this is absolutely essential for those in the academic literary and research fields
6693253 because the work that has been done in the online gaming for the greater society literary area has been huge
6693254 im happy we were able to release my online gaming for the greater society book on time
6693255 timing is crucial in this market and luckily we chose the right publishers for the job
6693256 this book speaks volumes about the impact of online gaming for the greater society in society and we knew from a business responsibility stand point that releasing it on time would really make a difference
6693257 with the release of abby tornows new online gaming for the greater society book were going to see record traffic levels
6693258 i think teaching this story will be highly educational for my online gaming for the greater society students irregardless of what critics believe
6693259 heck if we always listened to critics nothing would be sold they serve a purpose but i leave the fact checking to qualified historians and researchers
6693260 pre sale polls show this new online gaming for the greater society book doubling gross sales figures of other recent releases
6693261 and i believe sparkle maobis book may be a complete blockbuster if trends stick well see marked sales numbers within two weeks that will demonstrate year highs
6693262 were releasing rearick deans work online in a weeks time
6693263 i fully expect a sequel to be release within six months
6693264 typically we see interest wane a year after the initial release so it is important to stay on schedule and release subsequent books at pique points of public interest
6693265 now that macau is beginning to attract world class casino brands our only real competition is the

6693273 this project unlike other industrial projects that weve had around the region has triggered an unprecedented level of anxiety in the community and opposition as well
6693274 at the end of the day the community is adamant and i represent this community
6693275 ive come out and taken what is pretty well an unprecedented step i think to let the premier know this industry is not compatible with the values of this region
6693276 for this to be hanging over this community for five or six years is not good for the health of the community
6693277 i havent had anyone other than the company come to me to say this a project that will bring good things to this region
6693278 the premier is taking a close interest in this project

6693345 its our view that the players or the team shouldnt be travelling to pakistan at the moment
6693346 and we hope new zealand cricket and the icc make the right decision in that regard
6693347 if i was new zealand cricket i would be looking at the ministry of foreign affairs advisory
6693348 that advisory is that new zealanders should not travel to pakistan
6693349 the situation is getting worse and there is no light at the end of the tunnel for afghanistan at the moment

6693361 we have been consulting with major isps on our h 264 deployment

6693363 its hard for us to engineer a system that enables some isps to get content one way and others to get it another
6693364 this is an important contract that w rtsil is proud to have been awarded the installation is challenging because of the plants location outside funchal city centre with residential property nearby and for this reason extra noise abatement measures are necessary the modern technology that the reliable dual fuel engines represent together with low emissions excellent fuel consumption and the support service that we can offer were critical in our winning this contract

6693386 southgate told me that he wants to keep me at the riverside i will talk with him to settle on the best choice
6693387 i seek regular first team football both clubs can offer me equal chances to play on a regular basis both of them have very good strikers also
6693388 but im sure i can force my way into the starting xi of any team once i regain full fitness
6693389 i may opt to stay at middlesbrough for the sake of stability i settled in there after spending a whole season with them
6693390 the law is so obviously unjust and discriminatory it ought to at least be the subject of debate

6693437 its obvious obama has lost the initiative ominously democrats are beginning to recall with a shiver

6693494 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6693495 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6693496 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6693497 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6693498 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6693499 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6693500 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6693501 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6693502 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6693503 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6693504 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6693505 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6693506 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6693507 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6693508 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6693509 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6693510 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6693511 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6693512 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6693513 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6693514 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6693515 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6693516 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6693517 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6693518 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6693519 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6693520 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6693521 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6693522 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best

6693546 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools

6693548 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6693549 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

6693565 have you abdicated your responsibility as a manager to a watered down decision making protocol called consensus in an effort to appease everyone and get everyone to play nice
6693566 you are right its loaded with assumption and exaggeration but it makes a point who on this team should be making critical decisions about the phoenix project critical decisions based on the excellent engineering recommendations from russ department and based on the realities of production confronted by corey and his team
6693567 but i wanted to empower the team i wanted to get buy in
6693568 alicia this team is empowered to do what they do best this team has bought in there is a ton of commitment around this table

6693571 thank you all for your attention and participation in this meeting lets get back to work
6693572 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6693573 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6693574 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6693575 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6693576 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6693577 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6693578 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6693579 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6693580 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6693581 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6693582 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6693583 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6693584 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6693585 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6693586 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6693587 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6693588 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6693589 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6693590 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6693591 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6693592 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6693593 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6693594 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

6693761 i think everyone had a great time we definitely showed the local crowd and the media about the positive forces at work in our industry and this can only help us as we move forward into more aggressive larger projects
6693762 the fact that the selection process for recognition int he gaming website design industry is so complicated demonstrates a lot forethough and consideration for fairness
6693763 and this goes hand in hand with the level of quality we as a gaming website design industry demonstrate to the general public
6693764 i think the team is definitely talking to fernando but thats the question mark
6693765 the conversations are there and i am talking to the team i am talking to all the teams i want to be racing

6693774 what exactly was he planning to do with 2 865 bicycles
6693775 the police are baffled by what igor kenk planned to do with such a surplus of bikes
6693776 but i just found that its not as black and white as i originally thought
6693777 it had become the culture in his neighborhood to visit igor to get your bike people accepted it
6693778 it was gods way of saying its time to put a stop to this
6693779 he made a lot of money off it judging by where he was living
6693780 the public reaction is a bit extreme and knee jerk
6693781 you just get pulled completely in when you start talking to him
6693782 with the changing neighborhood i knew that it would culminate in igor being pushed out im just shocked at the number of bikes and storage facilities and the quantity of drugs is just ridiculous
6693783 eight of the 18 who returned from kohima died one by one in the last 10 days
6693784 it appears to be the result of some mysterious communicable disease
6693785 the government should take it seriously because the disease may spread fast and is likely to claim more lives if preventive measures are not initiated soon the government should send a team of doctors to treat the others who are suspected to be infected

6693793 the way cpi is calculated has changed which makes comparisons between eras or even years irrelevant
6693794 your reasoning is so specious firstly you have to recognize that inflation cpi is measured differently from the 70s so youre comparing apples to oranges
6693795 consumer price index research series using current methods 1978 1998
6693796 the measured rate of inflation would have been lower since 1978 if methods currently used in calculating the consumer price index for all urban consumers had been in place from that year to the present
6693797 changed homeowners component from cost of purchase to to value of rental services and 1999 the last 5 in 1998 1999 were maybe in response to the 1996

6693823 you see what id do is organise it into different categories so youd have separate databases for burglars and counterfeiters one for violent maniacs and maybe one for all rounders that sort of thing
6693824 id then cross reference based on age experience and current hiding place we could also include a photograph and any relevant web links
6693825 so lets say youre planning to rob an art gallery in bristol but your number one choice is based in london and doesnt like to work outside the m25
6693826 youd go into the database and find a local guy with the right experience at the right price its a bit like confused com for evil masterminds

6693838 i looked back and saw the limbs of my colleagues flying through the air
6693839 only innocent people die when the pakistan army carries out air strikes in bajaur or swat
6693840 if the army is really fond of fighting it should send ground forces to see how we fight
6693841 we have to devise a policy which is national which protects and serves our own interests
6693842 its not like we are wealthy people but theyll kidnap you for a watch

6693856 no im not your mother she keeps putting pictures up of other peoples pets on her blog remember
6693857 finding no valid reason to do so she refused at which point several plainclothes men who did not identify themselves took over
6693858 this is the third time this year bensedrine has had trouble crossing the tunisian border and the second time she has received rough treatment at the hands of border police when attempting to travel by land sea or air
6693859 this is completely outrageous behaviour to be meted out to any law abiding citizen and particularly disgraceful that a woman should be treated so poorly at the hands of a group of police officers once again we are forced to remind the tunisian government that it is rapidly losing its reputation as a country that respects womens rights
6693860 it was the first time they used such violent force to try to submit me to a full and humiliating body search and that i was prevented from leaving the country i had the feeling that they wanted to settle scores with me i dont know how on earth they are under the illusion that i may represent a threat or a danger
6693861 the man who has been drinking blood in kihoto brought police to my house saying he had been supplying blood to us
6693862 ive known this suspect for some time because he is one of the street boys i used to feed at my church i also helped them with money to visit hospital or whenever one needed to be circumcised
6693863 he used to walk around the town wearing long coats he had a black coat a green coat and a beige one which he wore regularly within the week
6693864 the debate about dealing with past corruption has been going on and you remember i was accused in 2006 when i proposed the amnesty law that i wanted to shield anglo leasing suspects
6693865 i am not an investigator to get involved i am a minister for justice and constitutional affairs we have boundaries
6693866 it is a big hot issue in the world because the blunt object of prosecution only causes delays
6693867 they have tarnished the countrys name and index as the most corrupt nation the value of that money could have solved unemployment situation and inflation which has subjected 38 million kenyans to a life of hand to mouth they stand accused
6693868 kinder lernen am besten wenn sie etwas selbst ausprobieren die spielerische herangehensweise bei diesem projekt passt sehr gut zu unseren programmen zur verkehrserziehung
6693869 die nimbols begleitet durch frage und bewegungsspiele sollen die sch ler bef higt werden sich in gefahrensituationen intuitiv richtig zu verhalten
6693870 mit der nachhaltig angelegten initiative mobilekids bernimmt daimler verantwortung f r die sicherheit der jungen verkehrsteilnehmer wir konzentrieren uns dabei besonders auf kinder zwischen acht und zw lf jahren in dieser altersgruppe sind kinder zum einen schon sehr mobil und nehmen mit ihren fahrr dern skateboards und inline skates aktiv am stra enverkehr teil gleichzeitig sind sie aber noch unerfahren und deshalb besonders gef hrdet daher stehen sie im mittelpunkt unserer initiative
6693871 weil die schullaufbahn von jungen besonders in den weiterf hrenden schulen sehr viel h ufiger als bei m dchen von misserfolgserlebnissen begleitet wird sollen nun in einem modellversuch geschlechtsbewusste grundschule jungenf rderung in der ganztagsschule methoden und ma nahmen
6693872 es sind nicht die kinder welche probleme bereiten es sind die alten welche nie gelernt haben was freude am lernen und lebenslanges lernen bedeutet
6693873 my inspiration was the black silhouette how quickly hannah did it and that miraculous little piece of blue tape hannah was cutting some black paper one night and saw these two pieces that fell on the table she realized that together theyd make a birds head so she got out her favorite tape blue painters tape did a little more cutting then drew in the eye with a white pencil my favorite part of this was the little overhanging piece bottom left at the time she was into perler beads and i thought it would be great fun to use some of her art materials for my interpretation of her drawings so the perler pieces were put together by me from her drawings she helped with color and was very quick to tell me what wasnt working and where id strayed from her originals shes very confident about everything she does and im so envious of how quickly and decisively she draw for a living so thats what i gravitated to when looking for things for us to do together
6693874 these were basically attacks intended to result in the social exclusion or humiliation of the speaker punctuated on occasion with profanity a nasty glare or even a solid punch to the arm
6693875 what did the big chimney say to the little chimney
6693876 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humor in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker
6693877 being selected as an appropriate audience for a stupid joke suggests that there is something amiss with the hearers sense of humor
6693878 i told them just go out and tell bad jokes be a hero in the field
6693879 the younger you are and the closer you are in age to your failed humorist the more likely you are to attack
6693880 it was a very close knit friendship with one ideal to help the jews

6693884 which is kind of exciting so theres a lot of some sense of leaving the past behind and moving to the next part of the superman mythology
6693885 i think allison has just been such a great chloe
6693886 and will always be that chloe this year its just about opening up her world a little bit more same thing with clark kent i think that the show has been successful based on its ability to kind of give us an origin story of superman that felt real but also had some reinterpretations in it we are just following in those footsteps that al and miles created for us so clark kent is still the same clark kent we just want to get him closer to the superman that we know that the general public is more familiar with
6693887 saving people in smallville was one thing when he had to run to the factory to save chloe the roads werent very crowded the streets werent very crowded being alive in metropolis as superman is a very different experience and you will find very quickly in this season he discovers its not so easy when youre running through crowded streets or your having to run into a crowded crisis situation
6693888 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think

6693970 were really familiar we really understand each other even our personalities
6693971 ive had little contact with her since she went to singapore so i dont feel conflicted playing against her
6693972 i dont think her shots are that difficult to handle
6693973 i controlled the match overall she also played well but from the fifth game on she seemed to lose her calm
6693974 to put it plainly t boone pickens is out to save america
6693975 he asked if we could we join together and do something i told him no because global warming is on page two for me
6693976 there arent too many authors of note who have passed through l a in the last three decades whom connie hasnt interviewed and interviewed well
6693977 this inherently transdisciplinary archive will provide material for research projects for generations of scholars and students
6693978 digitizing these tapes will give students and others an opportunity to hear and watch these outstanding authors for themselves whenever they want
6693979 seeing authors up close like this provides a rich point of view to their work
6693980 drucker believed that a healthy society is run by organizations whose values are shaped by a wide range of disciplines history sociology psychology culture and religion
6693981 in fact drucker once described management books as dreadful trash and suggested that he derived much of his philosophy from novelists such as austen balzac and others
6693982 is a beautiful setting for the tapes to call home

6693984 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
6693985 andys injury has improved immensely and hes quite close to full fitness clinically hes very close
6693986 due to the transfer taking a long time and everton not using him in pre season out of fear he might become injured he hasnt had much chance to get match fit
6693987 the chances are that we will use the three week period we have between arsenal and bolton to make sure we get him in tip top condition
6693988 im very concerned that the season has just begun and there are 38 matches to be played
6693989 its important for me to have andy up running and fit for most of those matches
6693990 i dont want to throw him in early because its the tempting thing to do
6693991 as often happens with these type of injuries the player gets back and theres a slight recurrence and he misses another couple of weeks
6693992 the season becomes very bitty and that would be a major error for the player and the club
6693993 im looking for another style of midfielder a more defensive one who is strong and tall
6693994 like i said before the dream is coming true this is fantastic
6693995 this is my scene the pressure was on me he has beaten me four times before and he is strong he has such raw strength
6693996 but i got through it my training my tactics were perfect it was all spot on

6693998 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6693999 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6694000 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6694001 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6694002 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6694003 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6694004 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them

6694006 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
6694007 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
6694008 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
6694009 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
6694010 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
6694011 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
6694012 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
6694013 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
6694014 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
6694015 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
6694016 who will be the new vice president whoever you want thats who
6694017 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore
6694018 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6694019 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6694020 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
6694021 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief

6694026 the army and police arrested a suspected bomber not far away from scene of the attack
6694027 they also recovered a suicide jacket from a nearby mosque and seized explosives
6694028 the army has killed hundreds of innocent people and we attacked it to teach it a lesson
6694029 we have a group of very talented sailors who are driven to ensure they leave no stone unturned in the quest for olympic gold those sailors are supported by a great group of coaches and support staff to help them fulfil their potential
6694030 what joy domestic sport stars delivering world beating performances under maximum pressure in place of the usual hard luck stories and feeble excuses for failure we have feasted at the top table of olympic prowess
6694031 its a fitting tribute to the outstanding achievements of the whole team
6694032 in athens the countrys medal total was 30 which was fewer than nine other countries but in beijing the empire has bounced back
6694033 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6694034 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6694035 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6694036 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6694037 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6694038 wir haben diesen schritt aus drei gr nden gemacht erstens liegt uns nachhaltigkeit am herzen nicht nur in der kommunikation sondern auch im eigenen handeln
6694039 zweitens wollen wir bewusst ein beispiel geben dass sich selbst ein kleineres unternehmen klimaschutz leisten kann und drittens lernen wir die instrumente und die unterschiedlichen ans tze f r klimaneutrale produktion am eigenen leib kennen
6694040 manchmal kommen wir aber nicht umhin doch mit dem auto zu fahren weil die verbindung mit ffentlichen verkehrsmitteln zu zeitaufw ndig w re
6694041 dann nutzen wir unsere privatfahrzeuge ein erdgasfahrzeug und einen mittelklassewagen der gerade klimaneutral gestellt wurde
6694042 da es in hannover schon seit einiger zeit eine klimaneutrale druckerei gibt k nnen wir unseren kunden jetzt klimaneutrale medienproduktion von der konzeption bis zum druck anbieten da sind wir wahrscheinlich pioniere
6694043 wir arbeiten sehr stark in den branchen energie und touristik f r beide ist der klimaschutz ein gro es thema
6694044 da wir unsere kunden auch bei der richtigen kommunikation von umweltthemen beraten sehen wir es als eine frage der glaubw rdigkeit an mit gutem beispiel voranzugehen
6694045 und ein alleinstellungsmerkmal ist es au erdem f r unsere agentur
6694046 dazu wollen wir k nftig verst rkt fachveranstaltungen anbieten die mittelst ndische unternehmen ber verschiedene finanzierungsm glichkeiten informieren und gleichzeitig gelegenheit f r den austausch zwischen unternehmern kapitalgebern und beratern bieten
6694047 if we use their tactics well lose the moral high ground
6694048 the fundamental basis of this nations laws was given to moses on the mount the fundamental basis of our bill of rights comes from the teachings we get from exodus and st matthew from isaiah and st paul
6694049 i dont think we emphasize that enough these days if we dont have a proper fundamental moral background we will finally end up with a totalitarian government which does not believe in rights for anybody except the state
6694050 a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor

6694061 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6694062 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6694063 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6694064 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6694065 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6694066 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6694067 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6694068 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6694069 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6694070 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6694071 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6694072 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6694073 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6694074 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6694075 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6694076 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6694077 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6694078 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6694079 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6694080 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6694081 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6694082 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6694083 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6694084 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6694085 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6694086 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6694087 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6694088 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6694089 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6694090 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6694091 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6694092 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6694093 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6694094 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6694095 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6694096 jerusalem must remain the capital of israel and must remain undivided
6694097 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6694098 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6694099 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6694100 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6694101 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6694102 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6694103 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6694104 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension

6694117 qualche utente si lamentato del fatto che il contatore sia inattendibile e non rispetti effettivamente il numero delle visite
6694118 poliedrica gran burlone e organizzatore di scherzi sincera affezionata dolce e coccolosa
6694119 simpatica che non perde occasioni per fare battute dicesi anche battutaro di prima categoria ma anche gentile allegro solare divertente
6694120 preferite che gli altri siano attratti dalla vostra personalit piuttosto che dal vostro aspetto questo non significa che non dobbiate mantenervi in forma ma che volete si sappia soprattutto che siete intelligenti
6694121 felice del binomio spirito e corpo vivi con le giuste percezioni e con la consapevolezza di chi non ha nulla da invidiare a nessuno ecco perch appari sempre sicuro di te e delle tue azioni estroverso e spregiudicato sempre allaltezza dosato
6694122 hai un carattere molto timido e introverso non aleggia in te nemmeno un briciolo di spudoratezza sei talmente distante da questo atteggiamento che ti sfugge persino il significato fai della riservatezza una ragione di vita non ti sbilanci mai e hai la rara capacit di mantenere sempre il controllo anche quando tutto e tutti ti sono avversi chi ti conosce davvero non ha dubbi in proposito
6694123 riesci a far buon uso del linguaggio sei sicuro di te stesso e non parli mai a vanvera non fai del linguaggio una ragione di vita ma quando occorre sai spiegarti perfettamente hai la capacit di trovare le parole giuste quando la situazione lo richiede senza per questo scadere nella retorica un buon uso della dialettica condito dalla condizione di saper ascoltare moderato
6694124 hai lambizione di crescere professionalmente del resto perch non dovrebbe essere cos ci non significa necessariamente che sei disposto a sacrificare ogni istante della tua esistenza per il lavoro hai linnata capacit di saperti adattare alle circostanze non esiti a sacrificarti per raggiungere ottimi risultati ma il tuo tempo libero e i tuoi interessi sono sacri composto
6694125 hai un rapporto piuttosto concreto e stabile con il tuo denaro non ami sbilanciarti fare il cosiddetto passo pi lungo della gamba non nel tuo stile questo per non significa che tu non sappia toglierti certe soddisfazioni sei concreto e attento al risparmio ma anche disposto a sacrifici per coltivare i tuoi interessi la tua sembrerebbe la politica vincente il modo migliore per godersi la vita
6694126 i pensieri che corrono le frasi che segnano le emozioni che proviamo
6694127 sei la persona pi tenera e dolce che abbia mai incontrato in questo mondo fatato
6694128 le mie coccole sono per quella persona che quando ho iniziato con il blog mi ha insegnato ad inserire immagini scritte e come si pu parlare con la gente anche se in modo virtuale sono le coccole di un genitore a cui tu come figlio hai insegnato a passare qualche ora nel blog e a conoscere tanta gente stupenda forse virutale ma forse pi vera di chi ti pi vicino una forte stretta di mano
6694129 non ho resistito alla tentazione e sono ripassata complimenti per il tuo blog mi piace moltissimo ho iniziato a leggere qualcosa e pi leggevo e pi avevo voglia di andare avanti proprio come un romanzo che ti appassiona
6694130 lo sai forse il motivo del tuo successo che scrivi tanto ogni giorno hai un blog super aggiornato scrivi cose che vivi sulla tua pelle cose semplici della vita quotidiana le scrivi dettagliate con trasporto ed emozione sei sincero parli ai lettori con voce umile sei diventato un posto di ritrovo continua a tenerci compagnia ancora

6694136 lamore e un incendio che ti sfugge dal controllo che non puoi pi domare che scoppia e non puoi spegnere e travolge tutto quello che trova intorno
6694137 ma aldil delle frasi fatte che una donna vuole sentirsi dire correggetemi se sbaglio penso che non c bisogno di essere degli studiosi per far felice una donna no basta solo lamore e una volta tanto basta solo far parlare il cuore e dire qualcosa di carino ricordandosi sempre che il cuore a parlare perch lamore in fondo solo un incontro di emozioni nate pure e vitali nel nostro profondo e siccome penso che le donne vadano adorate e corteggiate ogni giorno e che ogni giorno vadano premiate per tutto quello che le donne fanno per noi maschietti per rendere loro il nostro grazie basta solo far parlare il cuore e allora si che una donna sar felice
6694138 quando vedi qualcuno che invidioso di te guardalo negli occhi e digli
6694139 niente che non fosse vero ho solo riscritto il tuo in maniera diversa
6694140 i figli sono strani un giorno sono piccoli triciclisti e un altro giorno jumbo jettano verso luniversit
6694141 sorridi anche se sei triste perch non c nulla di pi triste della tristezza di non poter sorridere
6694142 ho vissuto un film e lui non ha visto la stessa pellicola
6694143 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
6694144 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6694145 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6694146 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6694147 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6694148 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6694149 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6694150 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6694151 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6694152 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6694153 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6694154 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6694155 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6694156 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6694157 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6694158 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6694159 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6694160 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6694161 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6694162 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6694163 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6694164 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6694165 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6694166 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6694167 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6694168 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6694169 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6694170 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6694171 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection

6694173 we know that here in south carolina we have a disparity in health care
6694174 we have to bring in communities that will be more affected make them part of the decision making
6694175 why do you need us to join the climate debate are you saying because i am black i am not involved already or that you need more useful victims for your cause agenda
6694176 it becomes evident that while discussing climate we are not witnessing a clash of views about the environment but a clash of views about human freedom
6694177 as someone who lived under communism for most of my life i feel obliged to say that the biggest threat to freedom democracy the market economy and prosperity at the beginning of the 21st century is not communism or its various softer variants
6694178 why do so many people who subscribe to the belief in global warming also subscribe to the leftist liberal viewpoint on so many matters why does this belief appeal to those that have a certain political view
6694179 what does a cane toad and salt water intrusion have to do with global warming see you liberals just flip and spin flip and spin obama is an expert at it
6694180 it didnt take us long to figure out what this
6694181 if the lawyers will take the case sue the people who sell carbon credits that includes al gore that lawsuit would get so much publicity so much media attention and as the experts went to the witness stand and testified i feel like that could become the vehicle to finally put some light on the fraud of global warming
6694182 also i dont think that the republicans have handled the war on terror very well either
6694183 none of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed climate changes to increases in greenhouse gases
6694184 no study to date has positively attributed all or part of the climate change to man made causes
6694185 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense

6694192 i didnt know what to expect some kind of moonscape perhaps but it was incredible huge matrices of branching porites coral up to 8 meters 25 feet high had established creating a thriving coral reef habitat
6694193 throughout other parts of the lagoon it was awesome to see coral cover as high as 80 percent and large tree like branching coral formations with trunks 30 centimeters 12 inches thick

6694205 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6694206 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance

6694210 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6694211 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6694212 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6694213 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6694214 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6694215 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6694216 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6694217 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6694218 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs

6694222 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6694223 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6694224 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6694225 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6694226 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6694227 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6694228 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6694229 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6694230 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6694231 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6694232 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6694233 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6694234 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6694235 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6694236 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6694237 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6694238 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6694239 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6694240 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6694241 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6694242 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6694243 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6694244 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done

6694250 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6694251 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6694252 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6694253 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6694254 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6694255 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6694256 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6694257 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6694258 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified

6694293 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6694294 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6694295 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6694296 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6694297 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6694298 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6694299 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6694300 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6694301 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6694302 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6694303 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6694304 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6694305 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6694306 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6694307 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6694308 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
6694309 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6694310 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6694311 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6694312 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods

6694350 not every earmark is bad but my goodness they ought to pass the straight face test
6694351 but i just found that its not as black and white as i originally thought
6694352 it had become the culture in his neighborhood to visit igor to get your bike people accepted it
6694353 it was gods way of saying its time to put a stop to this
6694354 he made a lot of money off it judging by where he was living
6694355 the public reaction is a bit extreme and knee jerk

6694358 after recently being asked by the england management to reassess my retirement from international one day cricket ive decided to join englands squad for the natwest series after careful consideration
6694359 its something i have been thinking about for a period of time and due to recent injuries in the england camp the opportunity has arisen for me to play a role in this series
6694360 i decided to retire from englands odi team for a number reasons one being the amount of time i was spending away from my family
6694361 now that my family is settled and my bowling is settled i feel i have something to offer englands odi side and am looking forward to playing a part in the natwest series against south africa
6694362 having missed out on selection at various times this year i am well aware of the disappointment that comes from not being a part of the england dressing room
6694363 with that in mind i want to be a part of the team and if that means bringing myself out of retirement to play a role in this upcoming natwest series then im happy to do just that
6694364 its a pretty different team to the test side and a lot of lads have come in wanting to impress and cement spots within the side so theres a freshness about the squad
6694365 kevin has obviously taken over as captain and everyone is eager to impress england for a long time now have under performed in one day cricket and weve got a chance to address that now and hopefully put some performances in
6694366 we got to the world cup final in 1992 and since then weve never been consistent
6694367 were definitely aware of that but we cant let it lie too heavily on us weve got to go out there and perform and were well aware of that but weve got to do it consistently
6694368 theyre the form side theyve beaten everyone theyve come up against
6694369 they are a formidable team in one day internationals and its going to be tough for us but weve got to test ourselves against these sides
6694370 weve beaten the best sides in the world before but weve got to beat them over a period of time and not just in one off games
6694371 we have been in touch with the communications commission of kenya over this issue after consultations that included visits to our sites to evaluate work already done they have given us upto end of november as the new date i assure you we will meet it

6694381 it is my pleasure to welcome you back to another school year
6694382 how fortunate i am to fill at 39 years of age the position ive always wanted
6694383 great teachers doing great teaching the quality of an educational system cannot exceed the quality of its teaching
6694384 perfect 100 percent in reading on the ohio graduation test
6694385 we have the dubious task of preparing kids for jobs not even created yet
6694386 incremental change in our school system is not getting the job done
6694387 it is a new day for learning in ohio and the wooster city schools
6694388 its not a good year for any republican its not a good political climate out there
6694389 there are democrats who are socially conservative who care about abortion issues marriage issues

6694391 we are asking voters to fill out a brief survey it takes less than a minute
6694392 if out of 10 we can get maybe eight democrats that are willing to support john mccain we win
6694393 obviously as a confidence builder you want to win that first one
6694394 its a huge boost the kids see the fruits of their labor from summer and the fall camp
6694395 its important the kids believe they can win and we believe we can win the game friday
6694396 triways spread offense is something we dont see much of or at least we have some kids who havent seen it they can attack you in many ways with their spread so we need to be very disciplined weve been telling the defense to make sure you get your job done before you go help someone else
6694397 from what ive seen they have some very skilled kids a lot of them back from last year the quarterback is a real good athlete they have two big receivers and a couple others and the running back is doing a nice job from what we saw
6694398 we havent allowed zac to be hit a lot but he took a couple of nice shots in our last scrimmage and bounced right up
6694399 hes ready to go well be counting on him a great deal and hes handled it very well
6694400 weve been playing with an attitude these kids want to find a way to win
6694401 weve always had good hard nosed kids down here but this year weve got that attitude to go with it well wait and see what we do on the field friday night i guess well know what we have when we do that
6694402 were kind of in their situation from last year we dont have 13 three year starters like they did but we have 18 starters back and a lot of them have been playing since about the middle of their sophomore year
6694403 so were excited now its a matter of us performing
6694404 i think the kids believe they can win and thats important theyve worked hard too
6694405 were excited about the opportunity we have friday night now its just a matter of seizing it
6694406 my wife and i have talked it over extensively and have come to the conclusion that it would be in our familys best interest if i would step down from this campaign and take the state job
6694407 ive kind of always wanted to run for that office i am a retired ohio department of transportation worker and as long as i worked for the state of ohio i wasnt allowed to run for any partisan county office
6694408 im running as a democratic candidate i think theres a fair population of democratic voters in the county
6694409 its something the democratic party has been talking about for years we dont have any candidates on the ballot and i certainly feel i can handle the job
6694410 the product is safe to humans animals and the environment
6694411 ive been waiting for this since i was in fifth grade
6694412 i dont know if it was the lights or the uniforms but we just brought a lot more enthusiasm and energy tonight
6694413 i told her in the first half that she looked focused and struck the ball well
6694414 on that goal she hit it perfect and had a great foot
6694415 its unbelievable to score the winning goal in our first game
6694416 we had two good attempts but they had one long range strike and connected on it
6694417 its great for them being a first year program it was just a little unlucky for us
6694418 that third goal really took the wind out of us
6694419 i thought we were definitely in the game at halftime i thought if we could score and get things going wed have a chance it just didnt happen we had a good opportunity they just came back and put one in on us
6694420 the whole key to a game like is you cant allow another team to stay in the game
6694421 we were doing a good job of controlling the tempo of the game but if they score that goal it changes the tempo we would have really had a game then we got that goal and were able to keep some pressure on them
6694422 woosters a great team theyre one of the favorites in the conference every year for a reason
6694423 the key is building on this and getting better we have a while until we play lexington and ashland we know how we played tonight we were in the game hopefully this will propel us forward
6694424 the first half was a little rough but i thought in the second we were much better and really controlled things in the backfield i thought we did a really good job controlling the tempo of the game
6694425 in 1980 the powers that be were not supporting reagan none of the party people were going to the convention
6694426 i really supported rudy giuliani my second choice had been john mccain
6694427 now im getting all this stuff about how important it is to be on the credentials committee
6694428 i had to send in a resume in 2004 that was the first time i ever had to provide a resume
6694429 the other thing that is going to be interesting is the hispanic vote
6694430 we have enough initiative we can take care of ourselves
6694431 i am concerned about energy but people have to be safe
6694432 weve got to have somebody knowledgeable who will go to bat for all of us
6694433 somebodys got to go to bat for us and i think hes the one who will do that
6694434 the first time i got to vote it was for dwight d eisenhower
6694435 when you see that red white and blue it gets you right here
6694436 this is what i feel is a once in a lifetime experience
6694437 the excitement of nominating you hope the next president of the united states
6694438 i am neither geek nor nerd i am not a hacker a phreaker a programmer or any variety of technoid dweeb
6694439 well i have some good news and some bad news
6694440 all right the good news is that baby carrot will live
6694441 and the bad news whats the bad news about our baby carrot
6694442 name is but sound and smoke size matters and never lose sight of the inner values
6694443 k nns som det finns r tt mycket i kroppen
6694444 oh god i am unable to live anymore let me die
6694445 i am neither geek nor nerd i am not a hacker a phreaker a programmer or any variety of technoid dweeb
6694446 la mezcla homog nea de una interpretaci n de la poes a desde el flamenco y del flamenco desde la poes a
6694447 ich wei nichts ber seinen aufenthaltsort oder seinen zustand folter oder arbeitslager bef rchte ich nicht weil er ja den deutschen pass hat
6694448 grunds tzlich begr en wir protest aktionen doch ich wei nicht ob es den tibetern was n tzt
6694449 quite frankly i think this proves the only method that works is enforcement
6694450 they want amnesty they want open borders and they want a more vulnerable america
6694451 my hope is it isnt going to empower them or fuel their enforcement even further
6694452 we will educate the american people about baracks judgment through his association with rev wright it wont be this week it wont be next week
6694453 this is the venomous nasty the country is seeing theyre looking at the polls and theyre just panicking
6694454 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have
6694455 the illinois democrat said as he spoke to several hundred under towering pines outside a community college
6694456 i have my staff get to you its condominiums where ill have them get to you
6694457 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage you might have a different perspective
6694458 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6694459 the team lacks an understanding of some simple things that hopefully will get better once we drive some points home
6694460 weve got a team where i can play in a role that suits me
6694461 he certainly required us to use a lot of energy
6694462 we lost the ball in a bad spot on the field before the goal and did not react well as a group
6694463 she seemed relieved to get the divorce finalized and move on with her life
6694464 we got a court order for her to move to kuwait with her children last week
6694465 we wont be able to speculate on anything until we get the cause of death
6694466 illegal alien who is most likely in honduras or elsewhere in south america
6694467 i believe if he is in the country its not legal
6694468 the children were important to all of them they were their primary reason for living
6694469 other neighbors said mendieta was preparing to go to kuwait to meet a man she met online and that she was planning to leave soon
6694470 dumb people were around then too and you just didnt hear about stories like this as often as you do now
6694471 is we are in a state now where moms and dads dont raise kids anymore daycare or grandparents do families dont sit togeter as a family to eat they camp in front of a tv and eat ordered in pizza etc
6694472 dit is echt ziek je kind wil een tekening downloaden op sesamstraat nl en hij zit opeens op een site waar hij nog lang niet aan toe is wat bezielt mensen
6694473 the dmca already requires copyright owners to make an initial review of the potentially infringing material prior to sending a takedown notice indeed it would be impossible to meet any of the requirements of section 512 c without doing so
6694474 a consideration of the applicability of the fair use doctrine simply is part of that initial review
6694475 we could exit to protect the safety of the employees
6694476 ive made a major investment here to move will be at a great cost to tata motors and to shareholders
6694477 but there is a concern about our people a definite concern about not being wanted
6694478 i hope all the parties even those in the opposition should think before taking any action so that these kinds of projects in west bengal can go through peacefully
6694479 he ratan tata is quite worried regarding the singur project he didnt anticipate that these kinds of agitations would happen in singur he expressed his anxiety and apprehensiveness
6694480 they have invested for this project they dont want to pull out until and unless they are forced to do so
6694481 das grundrecht auf informationelle selbstbestimmung hat seit 25 jahren eine enorme wirkung ohne dass es ausdr cklich im grundgesetz steht wir sollten acht geben dass wir unsere verfassung nicht mit reiner politischer symbolik berfrachten
6694482 were seeing a lot more spread that is concerning to us
6694483 this year we certainly have had parents asking more questions
6694484 he tried to have a tough exterior like a shield to fit in
6694485 he was a good kid who was dealt some bad cards in life
6694486 it was an individual directing his aggression toward another individual not the school or the students inside the school
6694487 he got shot and started walking and he was holding his chest there was blood everywhere and then he fell and his arm hit me
6694488 i took off running and ran outside and called my mom
6694489 everybody started running out real fast saying he got shot
6694490 people should not be forced to say or do things they believe are morally wrong
6694491 health professionals should not be forced to provide services against their consciences
6694492 may discourage individuals from diverse backgrounds from entering health care professions
6694493 to force physicians to either violate their conscience by referring patients for abortions or taking other objectionable actions or risk losing their board certification
6694494 i want them to be held accountable for this to prevent this from happening to someone else
6694495 nothing could have saved joe but the care there was hateful and incompetent
6694496 the study has very little to do with their diagnosis and it is not consistent with what occurred
6694497 dr bergmann made it very clear to us that the benefit of signing up for the study would be that she would develop an individual profile of joe that would help them to arrive at a diagnosis faster
6694498 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6694499 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6694500 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
6694501 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6694502 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6694503 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
6694504 i thought it had to be a hoax because it was all of a sudden
6694505 i tried to search online and find some more information when i discovered it was true it was very sad to hear
6694506 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6694507 from what i hear he was a pretty good player
6694508 i wasnt aware of it i saw him at the hall of fame and he said he was feeling fine
6694509 he looked a little thinner than usual but he never indicated to me that he was struggling with anything
6694510 i said the heck is that and there was an alligator floating by
6694511 i took my flashlight and was like youve got to be kidding me a big old alligator swimming around here
6694512 they are trying to find dry land someplace to hide
6694513 desire for change on earmarks and our commitment to get it done
6694514 funding will send your tax dollars back to be used in your neighborhood where it belongs
6694515 not every earmark is bad but my goodness they ought to pass the straight face test
6694516 this work was more significant for the club because anybody could have stepped in and taken my place on the pitch that day but this was about moving forward
6694517 i played for wealdstone as a supporter and i still support them now thats what this clubs about a lot of people from a long time ago still find it important
6694518 there are too many clubs in this area all at a relatively similar level and all swimming against the tide
6694519 only the healthiest clubs will survive those that have financial investment and are well run as football clubs and community organisations
6694520 i think some people thought we were just going for another ground share but the catalytic moment was when the main stand was painted blue people came in and saw they were our colours knowing its your friends who have grafted make you realise that youre part of this club
6694521 they have experienced some of these natural disasters and after a lot of hard work and support they are able to stabilize
6694522 thats what i think their challenge is and they seem to continue to have met it over the years
6694523 the real issue is whether or not were in a period where these floods are occurring more frequently or not

6694528 if a new president and congress consider changes to the drug benefit it will be important to keep in mind that the coverage gap has consequences for some patients with serious health conditions
6694529 we urge beneficiaries to choose wisely when selecting their drug coverage
6694530 again we emphasize that any changes to the coverage gap would need to come from congress
6694531 i tried to reach for it but it wasnt there i should have made sure i guess it was my fault
6694532 its not something we are proud of that happened but its a fact
6694533 it has become a mystery that enthralls people and to that extent id love to see businesses here take advantage of that
6694534 about 600 000 tourists come to salem looking for the dark side of history
6694535 the majority of the people that are walking past our door have no idea even what state the borden murders took place much less what city
6694536 by us explaining to them the place that the murders happened is only 80 miles south of here its going to drive traffic to fall river
6694537 wir gehen hier nicht davon aus dass alle radler das vorderrad stabil halten k nnen
6694538 despite its reputation for sunny hot and muggy weather august actually is the second wettest month of the year in galveston county it turns out that the heavy rains weve seen over the past couple of weeks are not that rare for this time of year
6694539 its going to take a lot of explanation for these folks to understand
6694540 pretty much from here on out its just so close were trying to win every game for the team if i clean up on decisions great but im just trying to go out and get deep into the game give us a chance to win
6694541 ive got a lot of confidence especially with the guys hitting out there and playing defense behind me the way they are
6694542 ive been able to get down in the zone low and get a lot of ground balls and strikeouts
6694543 it put a little length between us and l a
6694544 nows the time of year we start looking when we start following other teams and looking at the scoreboard we need to take care of business
6694545 he gets more people to chase pitches down in the zone so you just have to be really patient and really selective at what you swing at

6694572 d b s delight which aired from 1977 to 1988
6694573 d b s delight from 1983 to 1988 he was not and still is not a puppet
6694574 whenever we mention something on air about the show we always say d b is locked in the trunk of a chevy impala in vermont
6694575 the cousins or nieces or nephews will get to that age theyll watch are you smarter than a fifth grader
6694576 and i say oh did you know uncle joe was on a quiz show
6694577 during the commercials youd have to take your arm out of that puppet
6694578 you get to be a little bit older you really get to be nostalgic about things
6694579 you want some things not to change i really wish you could go back just once and walk on that set and be 11 or 12 years old again you take it for granted at the time
6694580 like i said before the dream is coming true this is fantastic
6694581 this is my scene the pressure was on me he has beaten me four times before and he is strong he has such raw strength
6694582 but i got through it my training my tactics were perfect it was all spot on
6694583 andys injury has improved immensely and hes quite close to full fitness clinically hes very close
6694584 due to the transfer taking a long time and everton not using him in pre season out of fear he might become injured he hasnt had much chance to get match fit
6694585 the chances are that we will use the three week period we have between arsenal and bolton to make sure we get him in tip top condition
6694586 im very concerned that the season has just begun and there are 38 matches to be played
6694587 its important for me to have andy up running and fit for most of those matches
6694588 i dont want to throw him in early because its the tempting thing to do
6694589 as often happens with these type of injuries the player gets back and theres a slight recurrence and he misses another couple of weeks
6694590 the season becomes very bitty and that would be a major error for the player and the club
6694591 im looking for another style of midfielder a more defensive one who is strong and tall

6694610 extended over three increasingly frantic vividly murderous rounds the death race itself is a tour de force of no nonsense neo grindhouse anchored by the ever dependable mr statham and his gruff buff stoicism the movie is legitimately greasy authentically nasty with a good old fashioned sense of laying waste to everything in sight including the shallow philosophizing and computer generated fakery that have overrun the summer blockbuster
6694611 these were basically attacks intended to result in the social exclusion or humiliation of the speaker punctuated on occasion with profanity a nasty glare or even a solid punch to the arm
6694612 what did the big chimney say to the little chimney
6694613 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humor in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker
6694614 being selected as an appropriate audience for a stupid joke suggests that there is something amiss with the hearers
6694615 i told them just go out and tell bad jokes be a hero in the field
6694616 the younger you are and the closer you are in age to your failed humorist the more likely you are to attack
6694617 it was a very close knit friendship with one ideal to help the jews

6694622 you just have to do some things different to adjust
6694623 weve seen an increase in terms of clothes school supplies broken in sports gear its a great way to get brand name styles for cheaper
6694624 its not just the working poor were also seeing more middle class families coming to us
6694625 parents would go naked before they would send their kids to school without the right tools to be able to get an education
6694626 you dont want a child to feel embarrassed or left out
6694627 thats not a good way to start the school year
6694628 gas alone is making me rethink a whole lot of things it looks like well have to do fewer projects or just come up with another creative way to do them
6694629 she said she cant have a regular calculator it has to have different functions on it

6694678 hes ok but i still want to see how the candidates are going to improve the economy and offer something that i can believe will actually happen and im not sure what that is
6694679 there are many people in many parts of the country that arent ready for a black man in the white house

6694705 the season becomes very bitty and that would be a major error for the player and the club

6694781 von nun an wird jedes einzelne rennen extrem wichtig sein und jeder einzelne punkt einen gro en wert haben
6694782 diese saison zeigt wieder dass man nie aufgeben sollte ich hatte ein paar rennen in denen es nicht so gut lief aber aus irgendeinem grund war ich immer noch in der lage ein paar punkte zu sammeln wir m ssen aber konstant gute ergebnisse erzielen

6694836 i think south africa are an extremely proud nation and especially at home we are expecting a significant battle in front of us on saturday
6694837 when you play at even newlands and especially at joburg and pretoria those venues theyre on top of you and its like a cauldron and the crowd can be at times quite hostile
6694838 whereas at kings park absa stadium theres still a massive crowd but they dont feel as though theyre suffocating you

6694866 i would be surprised if he stepped back for long one cannot be at all sure he has thought through all the implications of what he is saying i think he is saying more emphatically than he has said in the past dont assume im the heir apparent of my father
6694867 he was an important player in negotiations with foreign investors his whole stance in all his public speeches has been the acceptable face of libya saying we know theres a lot wrong in libya but we are putting it right but he also made pretty promises that have never been met such as setting up an independent tv station

6694884 such mental unbalance leads to irresponsible political decisions which lead to chaos human deaths and humanitarian catastrophes
6694885 obviously georgia really is on the brink of a humanitarian crisis and needs the help it gets from the united states
6694886 hearing more and more reports that people were grabbed from stores or that passers by were beaten

6694896 im using a satellite thats orbiting the asteroid and the rotation of the asteroid itself to wrap this ribbon
6694897 so its kind of like it wraps as it rotates
6694898 what happens then is light from the sun shines on the body of the asteroid so more of it is reflected and it actually acts to move it away from the sun and the earth
6694899 its kind of like a very very bad day for earth
6694900 scientists say if it did impact the earth it would carry the force of 110 000 hiroshima bombs
6694901 at that time well probably be able to refine its orbit and determine how likely it is to hit the earth
6694902 but there has to be a level of maturity when it comes to a discussion on this
6694903 the airline industry is very fragmented it is hugely capital intensive other airlines are starting to merge and we must be part of that
6694904 it doesnt mean the kangaroo will go it doesnt mean the brand will go it will be probably very similar to what it is now people have got to understand that this will happen
6694905 i am not saying there is anybody out there at the moment all i am saying is that many airlines are now merging in situations where they probably would not have considered it three or four or even five years ago
6694906 but we still are not big enough in five to 10 years to do it on our own i believe it will be sooner rather than later
6694907 try to imagine we said goodbye to a 23 year old boy today was his birthday now we dont have him any more
6694908 you can only attribute human error when the right emergency procedures have not been followed which is not what happened here
6694909 was not a serious problem with this you can fly
6694910 the plane was wobbling from one side to another i dont know what happened next i was in a sort of river and saw people smoke explosions
6694911 that plane is not taking off its eating up the runway
6694912 as it swerved its left wing touched the ground there was an explosion and the plane broke apart
6694913 we have to closely monitor the records but we see no reason to take such measures

6694915 well its modelling and the government will be doing its own modelling
6694916 thats the whole point of having a green paper going through this process talking to the community not only the business community but households as well
6694917 theyre suggesting there are a large number of jobs on the line
6694918 at the end of the day weve got to understand there is not a bottomless pit of money here
6694919 unfortunately some of the big polluting industries and corporations dont want to take responsibility for reducing their emissions and are seeking exemptions from the carbon pollution reduction scheme
6694920 it is a selfish and short sighted approach on their part
6694921 were concerned that there is no responsible business voice out there
6694922 weve seen a lot of special pleading from business but weve seen no plan about how they want to be here in 20 years time with a low carbon output
6694923 some of the businesses have genuine trade exposure and they will get assistance
6694924 today the reference for many people is the videogame which has opened a new field in art both traditional and digital
6694925 my current version of oterp operates on a small scale only a town so its good for a demonstration in a festival
6694926 sounds are played depending on your gps co ordinates you navigate through a sort of field of giant buttons that you activate one after another in various combinations ive recently tried some experiments with the movement and acceleration but i have not yet found a good balance
6694927 for the moment im only at ten percent of the project i have some ideas to transform oterp into a videogame totally inspired by jet set radio and other games like soundvoyager
6694928 today the reference for many people is the videogame which has opened a new field in art both traditional and digital some artists like aram bartholl play on the adaptation of videogames rules in our world and people like fur with their painstation and niklas roy with pongmechanik mix the principles of games with other technologies

6694934 he was a very distinguished parliamentarian and social reformer who has left an indelible mark on his country the lives of millions of people over the years have been improved because of his social reforms
6694935 leo was a passionate welshman and a fine constituency mp for the eastern valley which he represented in parliament for nearly 30 years
6694936 i personally owe him a great debt and i know that mps from all sides of the house will mourn his passing
6694937 you do much more good in terms of human happiness than 90 of the work done in parliament on political issues
6694938 an analysis of the repressed homosexual components of the relationship between gordon brown and tony blair
6694939 leo was courageous highly principled very funny and totally unique
6694940 we are glad that he had such a long and fulfilling life in which he gained so much social progress by being an outstanding free thinking socialist
6694941 as a nation we should be grateful for his contribution as a parliamentarian
6694942 he spearheaded some of the most momentous changes in legislation paving the way for greater equality
6694943 that was exactly the race plan we wanted that is what we have been working on all year in how to race an olympic final
6694944 i think we can fight with the big clubs and achieve things i was pleased with the project sunderland had to offer
6694945 sunderland have big players a nice stadium big fans they have everything to achieve good things i hope to score a lot of goals and help sunderland to the top part of the table
6694946 spurs is a tough game but there is a lot of quality here i think we can surprise them
6694947 im hungry to do well here i hope to bring goals and energy to the side
6694948 when a club the size of sunderland comes in for you it is an easy decision
6694949 the army and police arrested a suspected bomber not far away from scene of the attack
6694950 they also recovered a suicide jacket from a nearby mosque and seized explosives
6694951 the army has killed hundreds of innocent people and we attacked it to teach it a lesson
6694952 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6694953 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6694954 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6694955 davis embarked on what can only be characterized as a witch hunt to identify students who were homosexual and their supporters further adding fuel to the fire
6694956 he went so far as to lift the shirts of female students to insure the letters gp or the words gay pride were not written on their bodies
6694957 what happens when these kids get out in the real world after they leave ponce de leon and they have a black homosexual supervisor at their job
6694958 we are a small rural district in the bible belt with strong christian beliefs and feel like homosexuality is wrong
6694959 i dont think we are that different from a lot of districts at least in the panhandle that have beliefs that maybe are different from societal changes
6694960 david davis is a fine man and good principal and we are a gentle peaceful christian family oriented community
6694961 i emphasize that daviss personal and religious views about homosexuality are not issues in this case indeed daviss opinions and views are consistent with the beliefs of many in holmes county in florida and in the country
6694962 where davis went wrong was when he endeavored to silence the opinions of his dissenters
6694963 choosing to shoot the film in new york was a risky decision as the drama industry works very differently in the us from the uk
6694964 but the huge amount of strategic planning and the leap of faith are delivering a first rate calibre of cast there is a real buzz about the project in manhattan as quentin was a much loved and notorious figure everyone has an anecdote to tell about him
6694965 and weve been touched by the number of friends and admirers of his some of whom he never knew who have wanted to help with the project in myriad different ways
6694966 the knife was a special find its very rare when you find something like that you know immediately its special
6694967 this is a good example of a prehistoric knife made from local reddish brown north east flint objects such as this made from a local source are particularly interesting the knife has been allocated to in aberdeen which has the largest collection of prehistoric objects from the north east the scottish treasure trove system is unique in the uk and ensures all objects of antiquity are claimed by the crown on behalf of the nation and cared for in scotlands museums for public benefit

6694972 should the seller for some reason unknown to anyone at the time refuse to pay the commission that is offered on the mls at the sale of the home the buyer would have to pay it
6694973 the intent of this ordinance is to try to smear protesters
6694974 the totality of the circumstances our intent for this bill is not about suppressing or chilling first amendment rights
6694975 the only feces that im concern about is the expletive that comes out of his mouth

6694981 if i just watch my sister race im not seeing what my athlete does i watch my athlete because she comes first

6694983 theres definitely a lot of raw talent that needs to be found needs to be developed and needs to have some proper coaching hopefully thats where i come in and help out
6694984 marc and sarah have definitely put new zealand on the map in bmx and just because youre from a small island doesnt mean nothing theres talent there are a lot of good tracks and mark elliott and the rest of bike nz are just a phenomenal crew well see what we can do
6694985 theres action packed drama going out on the track thats what bmx is you see most of these sports and some i hate to say it are a little bit boring at times in most of them you have a winner right from the get go but in this just because youre first to the turn doesnt mean anything
6694986 theres action theres moves all the way round the track i think the rest of the world is fizzing about this
6694987 hopefully this really gets our sport going its about time
6694988 the bosses are saying its been good worldwide and i reckon it will be in for a whiile now plus everyone back home whos never seen bmx races are all psyched about it
6694989 the dark hunters of high lagaard are similar to those found in etria they can still work with either whip or sword to focus on bindings or status ailments respectively the key difference comes in their ability to set potentially deadly traps in high legaard dark hunters can react to either physical or magical attacks no matter what weapon they use
6694990 force skill bondage using every binding technique at its disposal the dark hunter will bind an enemys head arms and legs rendering it completely incapable of acting in battle

6695013 we didnt do as well as we would have liked but we seemed to have a pretty good turnout wed like to thank the community for coming out and supporting us
6695014 we didnt sell 1 000 so we probably lost about 10 000 from that the auction made roughly 9 000 but the bidding wasnt there and a lot of the stuff we had to go out and buy for our auction so that will take away from our auction this year
6695015 hopefully next year the economy will change and we would be good if we run into the situation with our fuel costs the way it is again the frolic could be a total lost the community did what it could to support us its just the economy that killed us
6695016 its effecting us quite a bit because its the only fundraiser we do
6695017 we look toward the fundraisers to upgrade equipment and get new equipment and right now were out of room so were looking at a new fire department between now and five years
6695018 we had a first responders truck we bought roughly two years ago our district paid for half and our fire department paid for half rather than having to go to the community and saying we need a major increase on the tax district funding or through a bond election we look toward some of our fundraisers to gain capital for new equipment
6695019 ive been going for as long as i can remember years and years ago i dont miss it we had a good crowd and the meal was delicious
6695020 its a big place and i think we had a very good turnout
6695021 ive been coming since i was a teenager and it brings back memories a lot of good memories
6695022 i think its great anytime the town gets together and raises money for the community
6695023 they only know the fire department when they need them the firemen are awesome and they do their normal jobs and take away from their family that takes dedication the citizens should be more supportive of their fire department
6695024 when i used to go to the firemens frolic there was all kinds of things to do
6695025 they should more participation and offer more things for people to come do
6695026 and theres nothing outside for the kids to do except the moonwalk and the train ride

6695039 pardon me if i seem cynical but i dont believe that those in our industry who are promoting this legislation and i have close observation of two of the major proponents the hicks family and the mays family are really concerned at any core level with competitiveness hicks and mays are at their roots investment bankers and i believe that they and others are promoting the lifting of ownership limits in order that sufficient numbers of radio properties can be aggregated quickly in order to get revenues above a practical floor for going public
6695040 some company will set out to be the first to own a thousand stations nationwide just for the bragging rights a thousand stations
6695041 a lot of good broadcasters will succumb to the extraordinary offers and sell and quit the business
6695042 the resulting dilution of management attention to any operation will result in an overall degradation of the quality of what goes on the air and what goes on the street

6695054 a married teaching assistant who sent a teenage pupil racy texts and photographs has escaped a jail sentence because their affair stopped short of sex
6695055 these were basically attacks intended to result in the social exclusion or humiliation of the speaker punctuated on occasion with profanity a nasty glare or even a solid punch to the arm
6695056 what did the big chimney say to the little chimney
6695057 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humor in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker
6695058 being selected as an appropriate audience for a stupid joke suggests that there is something amiss with the hearers sense of humor
6695059 i told them just go out and tell bad jokes be a hero in the field
6695060 the younger you are and the closer you are in age to your failed humorist the more likely you are to attack

6695063 ive never seen a homeless guy with a bottle of gatorade
6695064 a couple of years ago i was able to buy everything practically new
6695065 you just have to do some things different to adjust
6695066 weve seen an increase in terms of clothes school supplies broken in sports gear its a great way to get brand name styles for cheaper
6695067 its not just the working poor were also seeing more middle class families coming to us
6695068 parents would go naked before they would send their kids to school without the right tools to be able to get an education
6695069 you dont want a child to feel embarrassed or left out
6695070 thats not a good way to start the school year
6695071 gas alone is making me rethink a whole lot of things it looks like well have to do fewer projects or just come up with another creative way to do them
6695072 she said she cant have a regular calculator it has to have different functions on it

6695077 its about human rights to let palestinians and visitors travel freely to and from palestinian lands what could be more basic than that
6695078 the circuit looks good but obviously we need to wait until we get into the rhythm of the weekend to understand what kind or what type of circuit it is as we dont know much about it
6695079 but it looks pretty good very well organised and obviously the atmosphere seems great because we are in spain and for sure we will have a lot of spanish supporters
6695080 i did have a look and its difficult to comment at the moment because we dont know exactly the speed in certain corners but i must say its a safe circuit
6695081 so far i can see that they have done a pretty good job but its probably still a bit too early to judge
6695082 id have had two podiums easy guaranteed 110 per cent two podiums
6695083 but thats the question mark i have never been so enthusiastic about my whole situation with the team because i didnt have the freedom to do what i wanted to do i have that at
6695084 honestly the day that i feel that i am slower than my first race is the day i will call it off and stop the conversations are there and i am talking to the team i am talking to all the teams i want to be racing
6695085 with the advent of the 990cc machines this was initially greeted with many uncertainties related to the competitiveness of the machines but soon we saw an escalation of the dizzying performance which led to a reduction in engine capacity all in the name of safety of the riders as the power looked as if it was going to be difficult to manage since the switch you watch the stopwatch and now the times are equalling the 990cc machines but the intervention of important electronics has helped here security and safety is a factor to which the team riders dorna and irta have given more and more attention
6695086 certainly suspension and tyres hold a crucial role and must work in balance with each other and particularly in the light of the benefits that we have with todays tyres the set up of the bike has to be made very carefully it is no less important the role of an engine but with the advent of the four strokes the electronic management is the core in order to maximise the performance of the bike tyres and suspension
6695087 yes its true but you can reach a good final compromise in general we try to develop a balanced motorcycle whose base is exploitable on all circuits for sure it is better to have a bike which is adaptable than one which gives 100 but only under certain conditions a rider of talent is an element that integrates into this context and he may be able to cover any gaps in the bike and ride around problems

6695101 smaller economies in emerging markets need to have focus and avoid competing with larger economies on cost alone
6695102 the reason for the exhortation that the philippines needs to focus is two fold firstly the country is not large enough to compete against india and china on the basis of scale and so the country needs carefully to select its battles
6695103 secondly focus brings the ability to charge premium rates for skills that are rarer this means the philippines can avoid being dragged into a low wage low investment spiral
6695104 however the key will be to ensure that the open source businesses that are created develop high value assets rather than developing low value services businesses
6695105 there is a danger that too many areas of focus emerge in the philippine ict economy meaning that it will become difficult to gain the depth of skills required to develop globally competitive business that can sustain premium rates as opposed to the low rate economy associated with much outsourcing and bpo activity
6695106 for all of the outsourcing activities there are skill requirements for language it management and customer service and the various elements of the philippine education system need to respond positively here
6695107 however the more specialist skills and the sheer number of different specialist skills that will be needed are likely to be more difficult to produce without significant support and investment from government in secondary tertiary and vocational education
6695108 damage is spread out and relatively minor per school generally classes are being held

6695121 the way cpi is calculated has changed which makes comparisons between eras or even years irrelevant
6695122 your reasoning is so specious firstly you have to recognize that inflation cpi is measured differently from the 70s so youre comparing apples to oranges
6695123 maybe if things look up a little id have a better attitude
6695124 i had a few anonymous donors who gave me some too but i dont know what ill do this winter ill probably either starve to death or freeze to death
6695125 i pay my bills each month and have about 100 left and i buy groceries with that
6695126 then i have nothing left for the rest of the month
6695127 i dont think we have much of a choice for president
6695128 i dont know who ill vote for though i dont think sen barack obama has enough experience if i could id vote for the green party i did that once
6695129 it makes me angry and frustrated that i cant get the help i need thats why im sick i think the anxiety over whether ill have food tomorrow
6695130 is a money scam theres no need of it the price of gas goes down and heating oil goes up its just the oil companies finding new ways to make money
6695131 why cant we be more self sufficient would they rather see us starve to death we should take care of our own first
6695132 and we need competition in here that will bring prices down and give us more jobs that we need i shop at hannaford because i dont travel very far and the prices are much higher than they used to be chicken hamburg nothings cheap anymore
6695133 if i didnt have people giving me food from their gardens i wouldnt have what i do now

6695142 it is truly great news for clemson that we are now ranked no 22 among national public universities and second on a new list of up and coming institutions
6695143 what this means to our students and alumni is that their clemson degree is more valuable now than ever for faculty and staff it means we will continue to recruit great students and be even more competitive for grants and so forth
6695144 what it means to all of us is that clemson can work together to achieve anything
6695145 we set our sights very high and we are close to making our vision a reality for that i have to thank all parts of the clemson family
6695146 if we are going to create a prime minister position he or she should have responsibility to run government
6695147 if we are going to create a position of prime minister not only should he or she have authority to run government but should also have powers to drive and transform government one cannot be a junior partner to another it is not the sharing of position but it is the sharing of power
6695148 this new creation prime minister has to take into consideration the local reality it has to distinguish between theory and practice it is not everything written on paper that will be actual experience what happens in government is not what is signed
6695149 people have no food they have nothing we want to find a solution because of the difficulties people are facing

6695202 wilson and maynor were my two biggest concerns this week they had the longest journey of all our international players
6695203 you want your players back quickly after these matches but that is very hard when theyve been playing in mexico city
6695204 im not a fan of international games at this stage of the season but this was a world cup qualifier for honduras not a friendly
6695205 i was informed that wigan want to sign me on loan but they are yet to contact middlesbrough
6695206 wigan coach steve bruce admires my abilities he has tried to sign me when he was in charge of birmingham and now he has renewed his interest
6695207 i will take my final decision next week after meeting middlesbrough coach gareth southgate
6695208 southgate told me that he wants to keep me at the riverside i will talk with him to settle on the best choice
6695209 i seek regular first team football both clubs can offer me equal chances to play on a regular basis both of them have very good strikers also
6695210 but im sure i can force my way into the starting xi of any team once i regain full fitness
6695211 the people who killed mark murdered him for their own selfish reasons and not for the greater good of the people of the kilcooley or north down area
6695212 no reason can justify this cold blooded and vicious killing
6695213 i really am chuffed to bits sunderland are a big club and at this stage in my career it is a dream move for me
6695214 i have met the chairman niall quinn seen the training ground which is excellent and i know roy keane from my manchester united days its a privilege to join him at sunderland
6695215 having played at the stadium of light i know how passionate the sunderland fans are and im looking forward to playing for them i really cant wait to get going
6695216 david is a good signing for us he has lots of experience at the top level and his international record is phenomenal
6695217 he scored a few goals for fulham last season one of them was a well taken strike against us at craven cottage and hes another signing who will increase competition for places
6695218 the organisers of the festival were persistent in getting me to play and im glad i said yes
6695219 this is the first time ever that ive gone out on stage as a guest artist and although we havent practiced all that much yet im really looking forward to it
6695220 ive never been to northern ireland but im already touring in the uk so i wanted to come
6695221 microsoft will never be cool in the same way apple is cool
6695222 companies with 90 per cent market share are almost never cool sorry but nine out of 10 kids in the class cant be cool the good news for microsoft is that being cool has never been a part of its success formula microsofts real problem which has nothing to do with perception is that its monopoly is eroding even seinfeld wont be able to change that
6695223 i dont know why its acting like its superior i dont even get it what are they trying to say does honesty matter in these things or if youre really cool that means you get to be a lying person
6695224 the fact is that 640 jobs have been saved at cadburys

6695241 i knew much about bolton because one of my favourite players was okocha
6695242 when the manager came over to visit me in amsterdam i already had a very good feeling about it
6695243 i would not have expected that but sir alex ferguson and i had a very good relationship that is why i stayed so long there because playing for him was a great honour
6695244 he listened to me and would not go against me so i am pleased
6695245 it is hard to leave because there are so many nice people there but the fans will understand that as a player you leave i was loyal to man united for nine years and will now be loyal to arsenal and perform as much as i can which is all that matters
6695246 i wanted to come to arsenal because the potential to win trophies is there and the fire is still in my heart
6695247 hopefully i can look forward to a fresh start without any injuries
6695248 tidak ada satu teori atau model pembelajaran terbaik antara teori satu dengan teori atau model pembelajaran yang lain adalah saling melengkapi
6695249 there really is no excuse for much of this and there has to be someone in each of the trusts who is held responsible for what can only be described as a failure to implement best practice guidelines and common sense when it comes to hygiene levels in hospitals
6695250 the belfast telegraph recently highlighted the amount of money spent on agency staff and i believe that if more money was made available to ensure we have permanent cleaning staff in safe jobs who are doing a constant job then it would eradicate many of the problems being highlighted by the rqia
6695251 the rqias key priority as the independent regulator of health and social care in northern ireland is to ensure the protection of patients
6695252 at a time when hospitals are under considerable public scrutiny we believe that these inspections will lead to increased public confidence in our health and social care services
6695253 in all hospitals visited our inspection teams found elements of good practice as well as poor practice whilst many of the issues raised within the inspection reports require investment in the fabric of the buildings others can be achieved through a change in culture within hospitals
6695254 it was terrifying the smell of smoke was overpowering it was thick and rancid mum led me out
6695255 we were on the fourth floor and i have to say the firemen were magnificent in evacuating the place were thanking our lucky stars that we came through it
6695256 we were led down four flights of stairs and were coughing our lungs out when we reached the street i had the presence of mind to grab our passports some money and coats but we had to spend the next couple of days dressed in coats and our pyjamas as the shops were closed
6695257 we spent two nights in the foyer of a second hotel and then we were transferred to a third one we didnt get much sleep
6695258 i was one of the first of the disabled skiers there
6695259 only three of us arrived early englishman stephen armstrong who is blind irishman eamon prunty who is in a wheelchair and myself
6695260 wed managed to buy new clothes by then and luckily i had met an italian skiing friend when we arrived at the airport and he took all my sports equipment out to the lake venue and i was able to practice and compete
6695261 but there was no way i was going to pull out after all that drama and i went ahead with it strapped up
6695262 i didnt win any medals but as ever the experience was excellent and will stand me in good stead for next years world championships
6695263 its been a horrific week but im used to that sort of thing ill be delighted to get home
6695264 if i win ill especially dedicate my success to rafa
6695265 i plan to stay another year at benfica and win the championship that is my will
6695266 maybe at times i am a bit too honest and at club level the manager is telling me not to defend too much to try and save some energy for when we are attacking
6695267 sometimes you just want to win the ball back and work hard for the team that is just how i play

6695275 what could they possibly do theyre not going to arrest me for this
6695276 im talking about players who are different animals to when i was a player theyve had opportunities to go to clubs particularly on loan and were reluctant to do it
6695277 footballers are changing these days some dont love the game as much as they should do if you love football you want to play
6695278 it doesnt annoy me but its a sad reflection on the people themselves one or two have had opportunities in the last few weeks to go to very good clubs at a very good level just to get games theres no hidden agenda they said no
6695279 footballers are a strange breed these days trust me i thought i was strange
6695280 in an ideal world you have to reduce the size of the squad the wage bill i have a chief executive a chairman owners of the club who constantly ask that we cant keep bringing players in on top of the ones we already have at the club

6695288 deception and poker go hand in hand the game is all about making others think one thing when the truth is the opposite in a situation where lies and deceit are all part of the game its hard to be honest with the one person you need to tell the truth to yourself here are some ways poker players self deceive self deception and table image in poker in poker the table image is how others at the table perceive you if you arrive at the table with a mountain of chips spilling all over have a very loud personality and start betting into every pot you will probably be perceived as

6695298 john kear as coach was very keen but weve been informed by the wakefield club that their salary cap wont allow them to enter negotiations
6695299 they are no longer candidates but there is still a possibility of salford re entering negotiations they are waiting for paul to finish the season and they will review it
6695300 we are at the back end of the big spend but there is another month before we start pressing the panic buttons
6695301 ive only recently started playing poker and taking it seriously since the poker league started in adelaide pubs and hotels in june of this year

6695311 food miles created are only one part of the equation this study will look at the whole cycle of production which is the only fair way to go
6695312 our research has shown nearly three quarters of the uk public want to use their weekly shop to reduce poverty in the developing world but they dont want to spend over the odds especially with the global economic situation and theyre quite rightly concerned about climate change
6695313 this research will enable the industry here one of the biggest wine exporters in the world to understand the carbon cost they pose to the environment this is crucial to maintaining south africas competitive position in global fruit and wine export markets in order to continue to employ local people
6695314 there is international pressure from consumers worldwide who want to know what the carbon footprint of produce brought in supermarkets is this study is about satisfying requirements in a market that is becoming increasingly difficult
6695315 they forecast trends but we have to do the research for the right reasons
6695316 we have to measure where we are in terms of our environmental impact and determine a way forward we have to act from a position of knowledge
6695317 the research will benefit commercial as well as small scale farmers
6695318 the web based calculator that producers will use will enable us to determine how we measure up to international standards and benchmarks
6695319 the carbon footprint of produce is being discussed globally but we have not seen a decrease in our export volumes
6695320 by doing this research and putting an assessment tool in place we are getting ahead of the curve to be environmentally friendly we have to be proactive
6695321 dat hoor je wel als we alles hebben uitgezocht maar het zit in de onderste regels
6695322 all of his bodily functions went down so they have to build them up again
6695323 hes also got a fungal infection on his skin but its got into his blood supply and poisoned his blood
6695324 he was bleeding in the stomach and had to have a bit of an operation last week so as long as this sort of thing is going on hes still in a critical condition
6695325 he used to have a plump round face and its a gaunt looking face now
6695326 he asked me are the lions in the top eight so i got that bit
6695327 hes faced danger on a number of occasions but hes never been in trouble like this before
6695328 i am not a big fan of the stadium and its strictly an architectural observation
6695329 i get sentimental about the people not the physical structure
6695330 i see the spot where gil hodges used to sit rube walker i look to see where tug mcgraw used to sit thats what i see
6695331 we liked the way he has been throwing the ball
6695332 he has experience and has pitched in playoff games we are expecting him to throw well
6695333 no one has ever questioned pavanos ability he has been hurt
6695334 this is all about the moment and day ironically enough we never have needed him more than now
6695335 hes healthy playing well obviously getting the at bats that he needs he hasnt had any setbacks
6695336 if he does have another good night he could be playing right field tonight
6695337 theyll stay in left field and tatis will probably spell ryan in right against left handed pitchers to keep him sharp youll have two or three options to choose from depending on who gets hot or who has a good matchup
6695338 i see him playing a couple days and depending on the matchups maybe after a saturday night game give him a day off on sunday get him going and then let him go let him play
6695339 he was a very good player for us for a while probably our best player id like to see him get back to that level thatd be a great addition for us
6695340 growing investor pressure is prompting more companies to see the value of making environmentally sound products
6695341 he didnt care that he was a hall of fame guard one of the premier linemen in this league he didnt wear it on his sleeve
6695342 his services to the league for five decades wont be questioned his services to the players wont be questioned i think hell be remembered as a guy that had the best interest of the players and took a stand and started out when there werent a lot of people in favor of that transition hell be remembered greatly by the players in the nfl
6695343 people are still in shock were definitely going to miss gene because he was a tremendous leader for our organization
6695344 hopefully everyone in this locker room recognizes that theyre a lot better for having gene as their leader he did so much every guy in this locker room can say they benefited from his leadership the league has benefited from his leadership
6695345 the contribution that he made as a player and then his work with the union has just been really incredible just an incredible body of work
6695346 weve been able to find a way to win some ball games and thats something we couldnt do early in the year
6695347 i lost it in the lights i didnt see the ball
6695348 i didnt think he hit it as hard as he did i thought it was going to get down i realized it wasnt stopped my momentum started up and headed to the plate
6695349 home plate was getting further and further away after you start it up and shut it down home plate couldnt come soon enough
6695350 thats my main responsibility and i was able to do that even though i coughed up a pretty good lead
6695351 i think pedro has the gift of instincts probably the greatest instincts of any pitcher in our era
6695352 knowing how when and what to do outweighs talent at times but eventually talent catches up
6695353 when bobby cox had greg maddux in atlanta hed throw 80 something pitches and go pretty deep but then he didnt want to send him through the lineup another time pedro is getting there at some point where does his trickology go from there
6695354 statistics might not sound like we can win but the human element says we have a chance to accomplish something history says might not be possible
6695355 the sinker wasnt there the slider wasnt there and the change up wasnt there i pitched like junk it was not a good game the bottom line is that i gave it up i am not happy at all seven runs in two innings is not acceptable
6695356 he isnt the best pitcher in the game for nothing
6695357 tonight was pretty disappointing but it doesnt make a difference how it looks its wins and losses
6695358 we have to forget about this thats the bottom line its up to us we have to string together some wins hopefully it starts tonight
6695359 everybody knows their front helped them win the super bowl so its going to be a good gauge for us
6695360 if you look at the giants and what they were able to accomplish last year they were the best theyre the champions you want to be able to go out and work against the best and play against the best
6695361 their front four is phenomenal any one of those guys could have been up for mvp of the super bowl they took over the game its going to be a good task for us and its going to be a good measuring point for us
6695362 they cause a lot of problems and its not just the front four the front is one set of problems they do a lot of stuff in terms of their zone blitzes package
6695363 the types of zone blitz are not all just the post safety zone blitzes theres some split safety cover two theres some split safety cover four
6695364 the task is going to be blocking their four and then blocking the different combinations from the secondary and linebackers that theyre going to have to adjust to
6695365 they were impressive against cleveland on monday night its going to be a really good test for us considering weve added a couple new guys on our offensive line the guys are looking forward to it
6695366 potential is a scary word but i feel like weve got the ingredients to be really good up front
6695367 you dont want to have a set back this late in the process well just see where it is
6695368 if favre starts off 0 2 or throwing a couple of interceptions hell get welcomed to new york real well and i think everybody knows what im talking about thats the good thing and the bad thing about new york they love and hate you at the same time hes looked at as a savior for that team
6695369 the new york giants will welcome him to the big apple
6695370 im happy for the jets man the jets are our brothers
6695371 we share the stadium theyre around us all the time they have a good quarterback i like chad pennington too but they have what they deem is a franchise quarterback and i wish them a lot of success
6695372 the guy played lights out last year there was no need for him to retire
6695373 that was a personal decision looking at his game playing against him i didnt see a guy youd say hes washed up he wasnt washed up he could have been the mvp of the league if tom brady and tony romo wasnt having such good seasons
6695374 our goal was to win the super bowl not to intercept brett favres last ball we could care less about that i feel we got a slice of history playing against an undefeated team in the super bowl and becoming victorious it didnt matter to us whether he went with the jets or stayed retired or did whatever
6695375 smart guys retire and stay retired with a super bowl ring of course
6695376 if you dont have a ring it doesnt make sense to retire i guess thats why hes coming back
6695377 i dont know what to tell you there he says he is but they havent given him the green light
6695378 right now we need to know at least what the expectation is
6695379 if you win two out of three in that series you only pick up one game in the standings while sweeping means three thats the time where the yankees have to put their stamp on it if they can
6695380 they have dug themselves a hole and you have to take baby steps to get back into the groove right now it doesnt look favorable for them unless they go on a run where they win eight or nine in a row to get back into it
6695381 i think more is going to be written about it the collapse come september and its up to the players to decipher what they really need to know
6695382 they are the ones that are going to have to put it out of their heads obviously the media is going to write about it
6695383 i cant believe amy winehouse self harms shes so irritating she must be able to find someone to do it for her
6695384 i think what he has done is really invested in the team
6695385 hes the head guy so the investment he has made in his teammates says a lot about the leadership
6695386 i felt good and i was seeing the ball good
6695387 hes the guy going to the mound settling the pitcher talking to the catcher
6695388 hes really invested not only offensively but in running things out there you see david wright out there doing the same thing hopefully its contagious
6695389 we are probably still on a growth trajectory before we get to the stage when the uk presence can begin to thin out
6695390 armies have never controlled afghanistan there has always been a political settlement
6695391 the government must face up to the reality of an ageing population and make a firm commitment to improve health services which enable people to stay healthy and independent for longer
6695392 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6695393 this is deeper than head of the union passing away and its deeper than an ex player this is missing someone that is and was like family its a tough day for all of us
6695394 you should have made their wheatgrass its tall enough to cut
6695395 the wheatgrass isnt used until its at least 8 inches tall otherwise its not juicy or nutritious enough not to mention that when its cut early it can take nearly a whole tray to make two orders
6695396 alrighty itll be just one moment im sanitizing the blender jug because i made a smoothie containing peanuts and im required to sanitize it after any contact with nuts
6695397 i understand but unfortunately it is a requirement dont worry itll only take a few minutes
6695398 well i have to go im on the clock and cant wait any longer
6695399 as you wish i apologize again have a nice day and come back soon

6695406 the uprising we see now is the latent anger against the indian state that has erupted again
6695407 we are fighting for our one right to be free
6695408 shows the failure and perhaps the futility of efforts to win the hearts and minds of the valley kashmiris
6695409 three four months ago we thought its all over now nothing to worry about
6695410 will that day come when we can move around freely
6695411 the sky is saying something the air is saying something

6695420 la souffrance nest pas le propre du blues pour moi dans la musique yiddish aussi il y a de la souffrance
6695421 improving water productivity and reducing the quantity of food wasted can enable us to provide a better diet for the poor and enough food for growing populations
6695422 thats like leaving the tap running and pouring 40 trillion litres of water into the garbage can enough water to meet the household needs of 500 million people
6695423 i was very surprised with the high numbers but it catches everybodys attention
6695424 so there is a distribution problem but this also reflects the maldistribution of water
6695425 curbing these losses and improving water productivity provides win win opportunities for farmers business ecosystems and the global hungry
6695426 uk water footprint the impact of the uks food and fibre consumption on global water resources
6695427 only 38 percent of uks total water use comes from its own rivers lakes and groundwater reserves
6695428 therefore it is essential that business and government identify the areas that could potentially suffer water crises and develop solutions so the environment is not over exploited to the point that people and wildlife lose out
6695429 the question of independence goes to the heart of meaningful assurance which is why we identify it as a key element
6695430 one of the key messages of assure view is that companies which write the reports cannot at the same time be regarded as offering truly independent assurance by taking on both tasks such an organization cannot be considered to be independent
6695431 the gri guidelines are a reporting standard tool not an assurance standard tool
6695432 we address the gri guidelines at several points in the report where we point out that some assurors give the impression that they are using the guidelines as a protocol this is unhelpful and is creating confusion as if we didnt already have enough confusion in this field
6695433 key goals must be to encourage greater uptake of assurance in csr reports and to make this assurance meaningful by which we mean following our identified key elements of assurance best practice at the moment the three major assurance provider types are all coming from different directions and their paths need to converge
6695434 we dont know why specifically north american reporters are so reluctant to use assurance in their csr reports but the statistics show clearly that this is the case
6695435 us companies are reporting but they are not covering the depth and breadth of issues seen in european reports the development of assurance provision is contingent upon a foundation of quality disclosure
6695436 believe it i cannot feel good about it its really bad its a really bad pill to swallow this one
6695437 he was just getting behind batters he was up and his breaking ball he didnt locate for a strike
6695438 hes healthy playing well obviously getting the at bats that he needs and he hasnt had any setbacks
6695439 i see church probably playing a couple days and depending on the matchups those types of things give him a day off
6695440 he was a very good player for us for a while probably our best player for a period of time so id like to see him get back to that level
6695441 talk to him and see where he is mentally as well see if hes ready to take on this task that we got here at hand
6695442 dont take this the wrong way but im not a big fan of the stadium
6695443 its strictly an architectural observation now the physical is just going to move across the street
6695444 i get sentimental about the people not the physical structure here
6695445 when im here i see the spot where gil hodges used to sit rube walker i look to see where tug mcgraw used to sit thats what i see its the people who occupied those spaces that are important to me
6695446 i just wanted to let the players know that ownership absolutely believes that were in this
6695447 we absolutely believe were in this fight and that well be in it until the end winning takes determination courage and heart and its time to bring that into the open in a big way i just told derek its got to start with you youre the captain and he knows that it was a good meeting very positive
6695448 i think its nice that hal included the captain hals a great communicator he wanted to communicate to everyone and he knew derek could pass it along
6695449 im optimistic and im going to stay optimistic until the end
6695450 i just wanted them all to know that george hank and i all believe that we are in this thing 100 percent
6695451 its always good to hear it but i wouldnt expect anything different theyre behind us they believe in us they always have for as long as ive been here
6695452 i can only speak for myself i know weve got a good team
6695453 i know weve got a good team and i wanted to convey that to derek so he could convey that to his teammates he knows hes the captain he knows it has to start with him its like that in any sport in anything in life
6695454 he realizes that he realizes his responsibilities theres no more class act than derek jeter derek jeters not the kind to not give 110 percent and thats in anything
6695455 i think if you say you need to do more now it implies that youre not doing your job at different times i dont think you just say things when people are struggling or things are going bad you try to do the same things all the time
6695456 i have not had conversations with him about whats going to happen with him i think cash has done a good job theres no doubt about it i think hank agrees though im not going to speak for him
6695457 the steinbrenners still give us every opportunity to win just like they always have just because hal and hank are more upfront now doesnt change the expectations
6695458 i dont know where david was going he wanted to score so bad
6695459 i didnt think he hit it as hard as he did he got out on his front foot and kind of flicked it to left i thought it was going to get down but realized that it wasnt
6695460 sono molto contento di vestire la maglia di un grande club come lolympiacos che ha compiuto un sforzo notevole per acquistarmi voglio esprimere il mio ringraziamento alla societ e da parte mia far del mio meglio per ripagare i dirigenti e i tifosi

6695462 unfortunately young guys have to learn at this level and thats what theyre doing right now its not easy
6695463 well talk about what he did in the game what i did in the game the at bats the pitches
6695464 it can be a little nerve racking you never know whats going to happen out there
6695465 wir werden in dieser saison in kein spiel gehen um nur einen punkt zu holen auch nicht beim fco
6695466 wir freuen uns auf diese partie allerdings h ngen die trauben im extertal sehr hoch stehen wir aber in der abwehr so gut wie in den letzten spielen haben wir gute chancen zu gewinnen vorne sind wir immer in der lage unsere tore zu machen
6695467 auch wenn wir einige angeschlagene spieler in unseren reihen haben wir fahren mit breiter brust nach oerlinghausen wollen dort nicht nur punkten sondern siegen
6695468 wir m ssen von der ersten minute an topfit sein ein neuerlicher kraftakt wie im spiel gegen sch tmar ist nicht immer drin
6695469 die sg stellt eine starke mannschaft dennoch einen punkt rechnen wir uns aus
6695470 wir m ssen jetzt anfangen zu punkten denn das wird eine harte saison in der wir uns wohl immer an den abstiegspl tzen orientieren m ssen
6695471 zur zeit denken wir von spiel zu spiel m ssen die liga erst mal kennen lernen ich denke nach f nf spieltagen wissen wir mehr
6695472 wir wollen auch in brake gewinnen einen vern nftigen start hinlegen wir trauen uns alles zu
6695473 wir wollen das ergebnis vom spiel gegen brake best tigen in entrup auf alle f lle punkten
6695474 ein punkt ist zumindest pflicht wenn wir so engagiert wie gegen retzen spielen ist das auch drin
6695475 ein team mit dem wir auf augenh he stehen d rften
6695476 dieses spiel m ssen wir unbedingt gewinnen wir wollen unseren fans etwas bieten zumal danach schwere aufgaben f r uns anstehen
6695477 we are just a little concerned because you have two in one morning and the circumstances are similar
6695478 we want to get the word out to get the public to be more aware
6695479 it is important for the residents and visitors to this area to understand the history that brought us to the point of being a critical transportation and commerce hub for the nation
6695480 i wanted to let him know that ownership believes and is optimistic
6695481 it was kept that simple i wanted him to know that was the case
6695482 its not making excuses its reality thats part of the game thats clearly our problem
6695483 were going to win it next year if we need to add a top veteran pitcher well do that well do whatever we need to do next year well be extremely dangerous
6695484 hal wanted to talk to him and hear what derek had to say and what he was feeling hal is very open and communicates well
6695485 devraient tre r tablis dans leurs fonctions mercredi 20 ao t
6695486 so the programme not only helps cats avoid unnecessary suffering but it is also a great opportunity to educate people about how stray animals can benefit the community
6695487 ich habe gestern im training einige bremsen m ssen weil der einsatz schon richtung k rperverletzung ging
6695488 to be quite honest with you right now im not thinking about anything thats happened with him the last 3 1 2 years
6695489 were expecting him to throw well and keep us in the game and give us an opportunity to win we need carl to perform
6695490 unfortunately he hasnt been able to stay healthy ironically enough weve never needed him more than now
6695491 obviously hes very excited about pitching saturday carls not worried about what people think hes worried about focusing and pitching for the yankees injuries unfortunately happen i think teammates are compassionate when it comes to players who get injured because they know that injuries can happen to anyone
6695492 we are just a little concerned because you have two in one morning and the circumstances are similar
6695493 we want to get the word out to get the public to be more aware
6695494 we have to continue to put ourselves in position day in and day out to win games if we stay somewhat fundamentally sound we should have our share of wins

6695532 they went out from us but they were not of us for if they had been of us they would have remained with us but they went out so that it would be shown that they all are not of us
6695533 what was reported by some media with regard to syrias agreement on deploying iskander missiles in its territories are baseless

6695538 with a fat soluble vitamin in the oil you can make a nano emulsion put them into a drink and they will be invisible

6695540 if you dont follow these tips you will be a miserable excuse for a parent
6695541 at first you might feel a special kinship with these women but then you realize thats an absurd notion why because these women are not actually human so comparing yourself and your pregnancy to theirs is like comparing your bank account or botox free line to theirs
6695542 im not really enjoying this pregnancy its all i can do to not rip the beer bottle out of his hand and crack it over his skull youre not enjoying it i spit stuttering and stammering furiously
6695543 it really doesnt matter what happens during those three or fifty three hours it takes to bring your baby into the world the second your child is born its all but forgotten at least until the next time you encounter a pregnant woman

6695548 i was told that if he took to the penicillin he would have a 50 50 chance

6695550 yea i used to be your size but now that i lost all that weight i am feeling a lot better
6695551 it came from line 8 but sometimes product is transferred from one line to another
6695552 clearly the high food safety standards we have were not upheld and were doing everything we can to make sure appropriate measures are being taken
6695553 the products that tested positive for listeria were manufactured in july but we have recalled all the products that were manufactured on that line from june 2 on
6695554 the numbers seem to change from day to day some drop off the list some come back on the list
6695555 in one death listeria is listed as an underlying cause
6695556 in the second death it is not attributed to listeria but the person was infected
6695557 something like listeria infections comes down to food handling practices and following those properly to avoid the risk
6695558 the cooking process will kill listeria but if it the bacteria is in the environment of the plant the meat can be contaminated after it has been cooked but before it has been packaged
6695559 you can go quickly but you have to go carefully we were able to come forward with a probable cause in 2 1 2 weeks with a recall with very small number of cases
6695560 i dont know where the opposition is getting their information

6695567 i truly believe that our customers not regulatory agencies are the best source of e gaming photographic images marketing feedback face it if were not making money and our customers are pissed off our marketing methods are wrong and not productive dont forget that private companies are in the business to make cash and dont make a profit banging their heads against the walls
6695568 were not hawking viagra so dont worry our email campaigns arent that bad but we also affirm the use of double opt in email lists to assure that customers who are truly interested in our e gaming photographic images products get the right emails
6695569 everyone in this e gaming photographic images sector knows how to blast out email notices fliers etc to people but not everyone knows how to do this in an efficient manner that creates profit margin efficieny in our industry is absolutely key
6695570 i personally believe e gaming photographic images marketing practices of today that are thought of as inappropriate will be the future of tomorrows e gaming photographic images industry leaders
6695571 we need to stick to our guns and abide by best practice methods in order to preserve the integrity of the e gaming photographic images industry as a whole if we degrade ourselves by using cheap marketing practices to make a quick buck we will only be hurting ourselves in the long run
6695572 i really believe that my employers are genuine and care about what they do they are not out to prey on people or report false numbers they just want to make money and provide for the welfare of their company just like anyone else
6695573 do you as business leaders and executives make sure that your books are 100 accurate and sound or do you leave this task to your respective accounting agencies

6695583 our premium bikes have given a push to our sales but we would also be focusing more on the volume segment
6695584 crizal a2 is an innovative product with dust repellent features and we believe that it will have wide acceptance in india we are looking for crizal a2 to garner 10 per cent of the total plastic lens market in india in the near future

6695611 prices of quite a number of food items have come down the international prices of maize have declined considerably
6695612 we are giving a subsidy of rs 10 per kg to below poverty line families
6695613 these days there are fewer jobs due to stricter building regulations and the rising cost of materials
6695614 there have always been peaks and troughs in the construction industry but the peaks are much lower than they used to be and the troughs much deeper
6695615 we are trying to create a sense of community here its not all bad news
6695616 its a mans world all they have to look forward to is an evening meal of cheap grilled meat and plenty to drink and the freedom to sleep it off where they drop

6695623 the bbc alerted us to some problems at our reading location
6695624 this lapse in hygiene and food quality is simply not acceptable
6695625 since we received their correspondence the kitchen has been professionally steam cleaned by an external contractor the manager and kitchen team have resigned with immediate effect and external food safety consultants have completed a detailed audit of the site and are working with the local environmental health office to ensure these premises are compliant
6695626 customers can be assured that we will not tolerate poor hygiene standards in any of our bars
6695627 really badly labelled and it is very hard to see that there is alcohol in it
6695628 the independent complaints panel considered that the alcoholic nature of this drink should be displayed more prominently
6695629 they are worried that consumers might mistake it for a soft drink the industry needs to guard against accusations that its products are masquerading as soft drinks
6695630 a retailer alert bulletin will now be issued to prevent sales of red square reloaded in its current packaging
6695631 in 2006 a village project collaborator convinced me to start breeding pigs this project has allowed me to raise a good quality breed of pigs which i wasnt able to do before
6695632 the proceeds from selling the first litter allowed me to improve the livestock shed and reimburse my loan of 1 million dong sfr66 i bought new furniture and chairs from the money from the second litter
6695633 at the beginning i was worried and wasnt sure if i could do it as i didnt have any money or knowledge
6695634 now i feel sure and really recommend other families to take part in the project
6695635 taking part in this project has been a very positive experience
6695636 i was trained in how to carry out artificial insemination and received support for buying a yorkshire breed boar the price of pigs has risen and we have gained from that
6695637 i am pleased to be able to participate on behalf of my wife who is extremely busy yesterday our sow gave birth for the third time 14 piglets
6695638 i have learned how to vaccinate pigs on my own and how to recognise possible illnesses in time
6695639 i am happy that i can invest the money earned in my childrens future
6695640 food prices tend to go up pretty quickly and they tend to stick on the way down
6695641 basically theres only a few cents worth of corn in a box of corn flakes so food prices are much slower to react to the downside than energy prices
6695642 mi piaci e a me piacciono solo le cose belle
6695643 but in general there should be some important commonalities between both groups
6695644 and 50 cash is a nice gift i also added my name to the gaming in indonesia studys contact list for future surveys interviews and any public discussions its a very interesting and important topic
6695645 i chose not to answer that question because it had nothing to do with the study of gaming in indonesia and everything to do with my personal finances as a result i did not qualify for a compensatory gift but that is fine privacy is important even if were collecting data for academic purposes
6695646 i loved the opportunity to meet and greet the gaming in indonesia survey takers and speak to them one on one i want to get the most accurate and colorful data possible for my work also i want to get personal ideas and view points that will offer some important perspective about the level of gaming in indonesia integration in our society
6695647 usually i just sign off on results and make sure they are published in a timely matter but this time i really wanted to get hands on with this gaming in indonesia subject matter so i decided to aide my fellow employees with statistical measurements and data analysis personally im very curious about local gaming in indonesia ideas and trends
6695648 for those surveyees that took part in all three of the gaming in indonesia survey sections we offered three different forms of compensation a cash gift of 50 gift certificate to a local restaurant or a gift card for the upcoming holiday season at the local mall
6695649 were really excited with the turn out for this important gaming in indonesia data gathering study with other 1000 participants we will meet all quotas for a statistically significant sample which will guarantee the legitimacy of our gaming in indonesia study data this is absolutely key to professors klas taccone and bayley grisson who will be collating the results
6695650 i was impressed with the publics awareness of gaming in indonesia trends in their daily lives ive been studying them for months now and some surveyees raised questions that i couldnt readily answer in those cases i referred them to write their comments down and submit them to our directors for further review
6695651 but in general there should be some important commonalities between both groups
6695652 iaf is a world class air force with great aircraft and great leadership its a great training opportunity for usaf and iaf to integrate our assets in training environment we would like to have iaf here as a regular participant
6695653 meetings are an integral part of business but there is a feeling people get called into meetings that they dont need to be in
6695654 we have released this cctv still in the hope that someone will recognise the distinctive clothing worn by the suspect
6695655 i am appealing for members of the public to look closely at the image and contact me with the information i need
6695656 i dont intend to lose this election john mccain doesnt know what hes up against

6695662 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6695663 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6695664 he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy
6695665 we loved him and he loved us we will miss him
6695666 he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football in that he is obviously going to be missed
6695667 he was respected by everyone because as a player he was a tough guy and as the union head he was a tough guy but he was also smart and he could compromise and he could make things happen
6695668 weve racked up a whole bunch in a short period of time youll see the red and white on a lot of podiums in the next couple of days im sure of it
6695669 who was going to be the first medal who is going to get it how come nobody had done it
6695670 because the honest truth is a lot of the athletes are so dedicated to their sports they are the hardest people on themselves we dont need anybody else to do it for us
6695671 we kept hearing whens that first medal going to come
6695672 that person on the other side of the internet is a human
6695673 the minister has recently confirmed with vanoc in writing that the department of canadian heritage intends to invest 20 million toward the opening ceremony of the olympic winter games in order to ensure that the event adequately reflects the priorities of the government and helps to achieve its domestic and international branding goals
6695674 no one level of government told us which way to go
6695675 it was complete synergy there was nobody who was lobbying because what they wanted wasnt getting done
6695676 we and all canadians look forward to a memorable opening ceremony that will allow the world to see the best that canada has to offer
6695677 to ensure that the opening ceremony is truly representative of canadas cultural diversity and linguistic duality by highlighting the excellence and richness of the performances of leading canadian artists
6695678 whos the government the government is the cabinet the government is the ruling political party which is the conservative party its not the priorities of canadian people
6695679 we would be very interested to know to what level their involvement is going to be is this going to be that they have direct input into being able to override anything the creators do
6695680 theres a disturbing ambiguity in the language a lot of very very vague terms that i think have dangerous implications in terms of artistic censorship
6695681 our government wants to ensure that canadas goals are achieved through the opening ceremonies naturally we will want to be involved in the planning especially if we have invested taxpayers money
6695682 this involvement of the federal government is our very best partner helping us understand and interpret the brand we call canada to the world
6695683 all of his bodily functions went down so they have to build them up again
6695684 hes also got a fungal infection on his skin but its got into his blood supply and poisoned his blood
6695685 he was bleeding in the stomach and had to have a bit of an operation last week so as long as this sort of thing is going on hes still in a critical condition
6695686 he used to have a plump round face and its a gaunt looking face now
6695687 he asked me are the lions in the top eight so i got that bit
6695688 this crime is a particularly unpalatable one its motivated simply by greed
6695689 she said she didnt want him to suffer but he was going to turf them out and wasnt treating them as his own children
6695690 but unpleasant relationships are in no way an excuse for what occurred
6695691 if someone rings the doorbell i tell him to stay away from the door
6695692 i take a look at who it is before i open and my friend printed off a picture of him for me so i keep an eye out to make sure its not him
6695693 its not safe for the kids and not just the kids its not safe for older people too
6695694 any time a level 3 is released in the neighborhood everybody should be at least more aware of where he lives and whats happening and definitely report any suspicious activity around him
6695695 i dont want him to move here my first job is to protect the children safety is our first priority
6695696 he can live here legally but we just have to be more careful now
6695697 these were basically attacks intended to result in the social exclusion or humiliation of the speaker punctuated on occasion with profanity a nasty glare or even a solid punch to the arm
6695698 what did the big chimney say to the little chimney
6695699 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humor in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker
6695700 being selected as an appropriate audience for a stupid joke suggests that there is something amiss with the hearers sense of humor
6695701 i told them just go out and tell bad jokes be a hero in the field
6695702 the younger you are and the closer you are in age to your failed humorist the more likely you are to attack
6695703 i may have been nancy funny but i was not french speaking nancy funny
6695704 desire for change on earmarks and our commitment to get it done
6695705 funding will send your tax dollars back to be used in your neighborhood where it belongs
6695706 not every earmark is bad but my goodness they ought to pass the straight face test
6695707 even though it would be very beneficial politically its hard when a very substantial portion of the conference isnt on board
6695708 then of course came skyrocketing gas prices and the opportunity to draw a real contrast on drilling
6695709 time for a change we are the people we can do it
6695710 this is the first election where ive actually paid attention to every single thing and i think its because im a mom now
6695711 i just think barack is amazing i admire him i admire michelle
6695712 i think hes inspirational and thats what this country needs right now
6695713 if not im going to go with one of the lohans
6695714 i think ali has a bright new future but maybe cody could really get the job done
6695715 i thought it had to be a hoax because it was all of a sudden
6695716 i tried to search online and find some more information when i discovered it was true it was very sad to hear
6695717 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6695718 from what i hear he was a pretty good player
6695719 i wasnt aware of it i saw him at the hall of fame and he said he was feeling fine
6695720 he looked a little thinner than usual but he never indicated to me that he was struggling with anything
6695721 who do you want to answer the phone at 3 a m
6695722 as long as clinton was a viable candidate in the democratic nomination process many of our members felt a passionate need to return the loyalty she has earned over decades of support
6695723 almost every one of them will transfer to somewhere else
6695724 the best available option for the department at this time is to close pontiac
6695725 pontiac and this state have had a wonderful partnership for more than 130 years
6695726 i look around and see everything that we do have
6695727 you know weve worked hard the last 20 years how would we ever start over
6695728 i dont look at what blagojevich says any more i look at what he does
6695729 the only thing that can save the prison right now is when the guy signs the piece of paper that says its no longer going to close
6695730 it was a very close knit friendship with one ideal to help the jews
6695731 he got really angry but i told him if youre angry we wont make a deal
6695732 he went out there and risked his neck in actual negotiations
6695733 non vediamo lora di proseguire la storia in un contesto pi grande
6695734 il successo dei due film legati a stargate ci ha mostrato nuove opportunit e stiamo sviluppando nuove storie per sg 1 e atlantis
6695735 our ticket sales were not what we forecasted our expenses were less than we forecasted
6695736 but the ticket sales combined with free tours of the eagle we just did not have the income and thats something we couldnt have known until the event happened
6695737 there are various ways to solve these kinds of problems in the nonprofit world and were exploring three or four of those simultaneously as we move forward no one likes to face up to these problems and make these kinds of phone calls but we feel its our obligation
6695738 we cant put those assets on a balance sheet because we basically have given them away
6695739 we put on a hell of an event but it was almost too good of an event
6695740 people could go all day and not spend anything and thats what happened
6695741 it went from a community based volunteer driven organization to a corporate type of event run by people outside the tacoma area
6695742 if the community responds to shore up the deficit it will come out of the budgets of the daffodil festival museums youth groups the ymca the boys and girls club well all suffer because of the mismanagement thats what scares me the most and that will be the greatest tragedy
6695743 some of the things we have in mind wouldnt have that effect
6695744 by working with other vendors i obtained a lot of mobile numbers e mail addresses et cetera
6695745 and weve been making a complete round of phone calls and e mails to everyone we can weve gotten no response no result nothing
6695746 i said your board members are on vacation but im sitting here in an office trying to figure out how im going to make our payroll
6695747 this is not an account we normally would have opened no one would do business with a blank slate for 42 000 we did so because it was tacoma tall ships
6695748 we ran everything through provided a good quality product and we cant even get a response from the executive director the president the vice president
6695749 we dont have the numbers we dont know where we stand we dont have the money from them and were sorry for the inconvenience
6695750 and i dont blame her ive been in her shoes
6695751 if i do not receive a copy of the letter requested above canceling the contract by friday june 13 i promise you as god is my witness that i will locate you in pittsburgh pa a fairly easy thing to do these days and murder in cold blood you and any employees who happen to be present in the office when i arrive
6695752 i might just follow you around for days waiting for the perfect moment you may be eating lunch or dropping your kids off at school or lying in bed with your wife girlfriend or boyfriend im trying to be politically correct
6695753 believe me this is no idle threat i have lost my home my wife and my youngest daughter in my mind now i have nothing else to lose life in prison or the death penalty would be beneficial to me
6695754 the park and county have not coordinated on the river
6695755 no one is looking at this in a holistic way
6695756 all discussion about what is right and wrong is moot if we dont get the levee fixed at sunshine point
6695757 in some ways we are playing russian roulette with the valley
6695758 it doesnt seem like a good idea to put a lot of stuff where the river wants to go
6695759 were in the rivers way the rivers not in our way
6695760 i feel we have a strong case the people who have done their homework their voice will be heard
6695761 berapa lama waktu yang dibutuhkan oleh indonesia agar bisa bangkit lagi seperti dulu
6695762 secara sosial masyarakat indonesia termasuk masyarakat yang belum lah siap dengan perubahan mendadak apalagi jika berhubungan dengan masalah perut kultur pun juga seperti itu baik masyarakat maupun birokrasi anda membutuhkan hasil instan saya rasa tidak mungkin apa yang anda lakukan beberapa tahun ini paling tidak menjadi bukti dari apa yang saya katakan tadi
6695763 saya rasa kamu benar dan pada akhirnya pendidikan akan menjadi kata kunci di jaman ekonomi yang bergerak cepat ini tapi bisa jadi dibutuhkan waktu yang lebih jika kondisinya menjadi lebih buruk ingat selalu ada tarik menarik kepentingan untuk kekuasaan di era reformasi ini
6695764 mata manusia selalu melihat keluar tak satupun yang sanggup melihat ke dalam dirinya sendiri
6695765 yang namanya kreatif adalah bagaimana kita tetap bisa menghasilkan kreativitas optimal dengan batas batas yang ada
6695766 the pricing is getting back to where we were a year ago but the appetite for lending is diminished
6695767 alexs home town has had bad press recently after a shocking spate of youth suicides shes hoping that success today might provide some welcome good news for a town thats been living under a cloud
6695768 because of all the bad press that bridgend has had recently i just think that getting through would be a good bit of news that we need
6695769 they thought that up when i said i was from bridgend the producers wanted me to talk about it but i didnt want to just in case i offended someones family
6695770 i would much rather be known for the talent than the girl that comes from the suicide town
6695771 alexandra gave a wide ranging interview about issues which were relevant important and personal to her which we accurately reflected in the programme
6695772 there was absolutely no pressure placed on alexandra during filming nor did she or her parents raise any concerns about her interview
6695773 the whole concept of viewing and sharing is what facebook is all about and the question is how do we as advertisers become part of that we cant impose ourselves into it it doesnt work that way
6695774 how do we get brands to interact with consumers in the same kind of way consumers interact with each other
6695775 we will conduct a comprehensive review of all our programmes
6695776 i like all fans of team usa am extremely disappointed with the performance of our relays
6695777 in mid 2009 the financial markets may start to rebound and 2010 in the real world continues to look better with the prospect of the impact of mini quadrennial events such as the fifa world cup in south africa the winter olympics in vancouver the mid term congressional elections in the united states the world expo in shanghai and the asian games in guangzhou
6695778 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6695779 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6695780 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6695781 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6695782 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6695783 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6695784 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6695785 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6695786 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6695787 if you trust every web site but not a government there are so many web sites so much hearsay
6695788 these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6695789 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6695790 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6695791 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6695792 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6695793 fair play is an important aspect of the olympic movement and the ioc is responsible for ensuring that everybody is playing by the rules this issue needs to be resolved and it needs to be behind us once the ioc feels it has done everything in its power to resolve it everyone is going to have to accept that at some level
6695794 there have been questions that have been on the table and discrepancies that have been alluded to by certain parties
6695795 the ioc is simply wanting to do its due diligence to 100 percent clarify the situation and put this to rest
6695796 i am humbled at the prospect of performing at a venue steeped in such history i only hope that the gods look down favourably on me
6695797 we all know he has the best voice in the business
6695798 its still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
6695799 but it has certainly focused the market on that geopolitical threat
6695800 the russian georgia conflict has disrupted supplies and it looks like it will drag on and create a lot of uncertainty
6695801 were not sure yet but we think it was kids or vandals who set the bridge deck on fire
6695802 it was started on the top of the bridge so we probably wont have to drive new piles or supports
6695803 this will have a profound effect on improving the water quality in thea foss
6695804 the defendant admitted that he was going way too fast passed two other vehicles and lost control in the gravel
6695805 the sponsors are trying to determine their efficacy and safety on children and adolescents
6695806 is hypertension in this age group 1 16 years a problem in india if yes what is the incidence and prevalence if it is not a major problem why conduct a trial in india and put children at risk without any benefit
6695807 if the company has not applied for marketing approval to use the drug on children why were phase iii trials permitted
6695808 why should foreign companies conduct phase iii studies in india when they have not applied for marketing
6695809 even if the trials establish the safety and efficacy of these molecules in children the sponsors would not commercially benefit because of lack of patent
6695810 it is obvious that these trials are being conducted to extend patent period in western countries with no consequence or benefit for india using indian children as guinea pigs
6695811 i shudder to think what this number would be in all the departments combined
6695812 we want to clarify that none of the deaths was due to the medication or interventions used in clinical trials

6695815 its still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
6695816 but it has certainly focused the market on that geopolitical threat
6695817 i said what the heck is that and there was an alligator floating by
6695818 i took my flashlight and was like youve got to be kidding me a big old alligator swimming around here
6695819 this is the first day we can actually see the tops of the roads
6695820 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6695821 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6695822 have recently made the most promising and innovative changes in academics faculty students campus or facilities ups and pacific lutheran university in parkland made the list
6695823 one of the largest embezzlement cases in pierce county history
6695824 lindy and her husband and her family and her children have paid very dearly for her misjudgments
6695825 shes not a repeat offender or a violent offender shes not a murderer or a rapist
6695826 i have been with her and she is very aware of the mistakes that were made
6695827 what i did was wrong im ashamed of myself im sorry not because i got caught but because its a moral wrong
6695828 all i ask is for the opportunity to rebuild the life that ive destroyed
6695829 you hold my future in your hands yes its my actions that have caused me to be in this place ive given back everything i can ive done all i can do please sir
6695830 i was going to ask if ms robertson could say goodbye to her family
6695831 la gente dovrebbe proprio rendersi conto che dietro quello che abbiamo detto c la scienza lovvio ti guarda dritto in faccia
6695832 most assuredly i say to you you seek me not because you saw the signs but because you ate of the loaves and were filled do not labor for the food which perishes but for the food which endures to everlasting life which the son of man will give you because god the father has set his seal on him
6695833 we cant afford to give john mccain the chance to serve out george bushs third term
6695834 the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt even consider voting for the john mccain of 2008
6695835 the price he paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6695836 and now he embraces the failed bush policies over the last eight years politics that helped break washington in the first place and that doesnt exactly meet my definition of a maverick
6695837 i dont think the obama campaign has done a particularly good job of linking mccain to george bush
6695838 i think obama has not delivered the message with the degree of focus and repetition he needs to be successful in a presidential campaign
6695839 the conversation lately hasnt been about bush and the state of the country its been more about obama
6695840 mccain is seen as a different kind of republican hes not seen as politically like bush when we ask people to rate the ideology of the candidates bush is way off to the right and mccain is sort of in the middle so he can be seen as an agent of change too
6695841 weve constantly got to pay attention to the need to excite our base
6695842 at the start of the election cycle the republican party was pretty dispirited after the 2006 election and in many cases that remains true today
6695843 they are playing god with dads life its like putting a nail in someones coffin
6695844 they have dangled the carrot in front of him and now taken it away its very hard to stay upbeat and positive to get through this illness without the added pressure of possible financial problems but we will not give up without a fight
6695845 what is the point of all this wonderful research which is mainly financed by devoted fundraisers in the uk if the life saving medication that is discovered is beyond the ordinary working persons resources
6695846 no matter what we have to do he has to have that treatment we have discussed financially what we would have to do we found it a very lonely position to be in at first but then i started doing some research on the internet and found there were many other people in the same position
6695847 i would urge people to write to jamie reed to get him to fight for local people to have the right to these drugs
6695848 takes extreme care to draw upon clinical evidence from nice and advice from the local nhs cancer network when making decisions about which drugs to fund
6695849 nice and the local nhs cancer network does not recommend the use of avastin for certain types of cancer
6695850 all the primary care trusts decisions are based on the clinical evidence of the drug the patients individual case and any exceptional clinical circumstances that may apply

6695860 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride

6695864 i thought it had to be a hoax because it was all of a sudden
6695865 i tried to search online and find some more information when i discovered it was true it was very sad to hear
6695866 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6695867 from what i hear he was a pretty good player
6695868 these are the toughest conditions ive seen in 16 years

6695878 having lived through 9 11 and having been responsible for investigating the hijackers in the attack
6695879 i kind of felt like the house was burning down with terrorism we really got a wake up call and it was like no more pussy footing around you gotta really move into action
6695880 and we did initially but im finding business as usual coming back more and more if everybody gets a veto it would be very easy to get back to where we were prior to 9 11 and i dont know if we did that what conceivable excuse my successor would have or my successors successor would have so to me theres a little bit of passion about trying to get it moving quickly
6695881 weve held a policy for the whole year if your form is good enough it doesnt matter how old you are or who you are playing for youll get a chance to play
6695882 weve got adem yze and jeff white back playing and to be fair to adam his form in the last two or three weeks at sandringham has been good and hes been unlucky not to have played more games
6695883 although weve got a lot of our young blokes playing form is really important you cant afford to play anyone whos out of form it doesnt matter how old they are or what you are trying to do because it reflects in the game and hurts the other 21 players
6695884 weve taken the policy that well talk with well sit down and jeff and adam will let the world know next week in regards to where they want to go and what their future is so well leave it to those players to announce those sort of things

6695953 innovation for the sake of innovation is not something im interested in
6695954 i certainly celebrate what paul did but its certainly not going to be good enough for me
6695955 new superintendents have the prerogative to bring whatever changes and best practices to the district they serve i did that im sure shes going to bring her own ideas to try to take the district to the next level and i wish her the very best
6695956 my job is to make sure we level this playing field so all children have equal resources
6695957 youd see many more teachers who are experienced going into more challenging schools
6695958 it is something that we would be willing to talk about
6695959 we may indeed have to go back and make deeper cuts
6695960 this will be the biggest baddest boldest exhibition ever that tells the story of african americans
6695961 think for a minute there would be no america without the contributions of black folk
6695962 from the arrival of the first slaves in jamestown 400 years ago all the way up to the time of barack obama were going to tell that story
6695963 we want to use temporary exhibitions to explore all aspects of american history and the constitution african americans from the beginning have been central to telling that story
6695964 its important to get a signal from the province that this will be resolved
6695965 for all practical purposes military to military cooperation had really already been ended with the russians

6695967 there is no bread there is no food no medicine people are dying
6695968 moving around in the city and looking and searching in different places
6695969 travelocity to take a closer look at how much travelers paid for their summer vacations
6695970 the mistake many travelers make is that ending their vacation search based on that alone hotel pricing in many cities has stayed relatively flat compared to 2007 the hotel stay is typically the most expensive part of any vacation so steady an in some cases decreasing prices means that skipping the vacation this year may not be necessary
6695971 fourteen popular cities with less than a 50 price difference include atlanta austin boston chicago las vegas los angeles orlando san diego and san francisco and others
6695972 when this critical column buckled due to lack of floor supports it was the first domino in the chain
6695973 apples enterprise sales group has been quietly installing thousands of imacs mac minis mac pros and xserves in hotels and cruise ships in a new push to bring the media rich experience of apples retail stores to the hospitality industry where hoteliers are seeking to deliver personalized unique experiences that will impress guests and bring them back for more

6695976 i dont care how poor you are everybody understands the consequences of not eating
6695977 theres no defense to how the outraged comments of district attorney lynne abraham and mayor nutter are tainting the jury pool
6695978 clearly danieal would not be able to be exposed to this had they done their job
6695979 that the mother is charged with murdering her kid is absolutely ridiculous
6695980 this grand jury report says that everybody else abandoned her and lied about it to cover it up and now were going to charge her with murder
6695981 because they were also denied access to medical care if you believe your child had a medical condition the solution is to take them to a physician
6695982 shes stuck with all these children and she realizes she has a problem
6695983 could appreciate the grinding impact of overwhelming poverty but thats the job of a good defense lawyer
6695984 if it were me id be working hard for the best deal possible
6695985 youve got to come out swinging for your client no matter how unpopular the case is
6695986 youve got a firm obligation to your client because frankly often the only person standing up in public for them is their lawyer
6695987 i think the big story here today is that there is for the first time an expression by foxwoods to reconsider their current site and they are actively exploring other sites that are not on the waterfront
6695988 we have shared with city and state officials the obstacles that resiting would entail
6695989 following those discussions we have agreed in principle to consider other alternative sites and ways that we can mutually overcome those obstacles we are committed to continuing those discussions while preserving our rights to the south columbus boulevard site
6695990 we anticipated that there would be two different meetings because the issues are different
6695991 a good first step towards achieving the goal of re siting both casinos
6695992 process is important and we dont want to go from one backroom deal to another
6695993 the people of philadelphia should be able to say whether they want casinos and where their preferred location should be not the casinos
6695994 its not time for celebration but its time to be optimistic
6695995 thank you so much for asking i think i am ok right now but can i take a raincheck for a later date i am sure i will need some help in the days to come
6695996 could you pick up a gallon of milk for me

6695998 the world is full of challenges the way to overcome them is to grow up and past the pain
6695999 i feel almost embarrassed talking about rent concessions when people lost everything
6696000 until this process plays itself out im not placing blame anywhere
6696001 what are they going to do to ensure the welfare of the residents here

6696029 we sampled oyster tissue on tuesday and wednesday and the lab results will provide guidance as to whether or not the suspension will be lifted or needs to stay in place
6696030 the last time we closed the shellfish beds to harvesting for this was in june of 2005 it doesnt happen that frequently
6696031 if mishandling happens somewhere in the chain that can be a problem
6696032 did the wholesalers where the oysters originated handle any other products from another state
6696033 i have enough oysters planted there to last me until this whole thing is sorted out

6696037 is not able to meet the health and welfare needs of all the service users
6696038 continuing lack of clarity at what precisely the implications are for adults with learning disabilities of the move to an in control approach to service delivery
6696039 it is absolutely clear to me the council cannot make the savings forced on the social work department by the last administration and meet the care commission requirements
6696040 i am urging the new administration to ditch the cuts and sort out their future plans
6696041 from the outside you could be forgiven for forming the view that the department has started the process of deliberately running down the day care centres before the alternative strategy they are talking about is fully understood costed or in place
6696042 in light of the findings of the care commission highland council need to take immediate steps to resolve the staffing shortages at the corbett centre and ensure there are adequate arrangements to cover staff absence
6696043 it cannot be right that service users are deprived their opportunity to attend the centre as the council cant secure absence cover
6696044 to try and make huge cuts in this budget while not yet meeting the existing needs of users is not a sustainable strategy
6696045 despite the best efforts of the staff who are at the centre the care of the users is being compromised because they do not have the staff they need
6696046 i saw and heard from users the benefits that are enjoyed by coming to the corbett centre and visiting other services for them in brora for example
6696047 users are supported in a whole range of activities and outreach services some of which have been cancelled due to staff vacancies not being filled or there being inadequate cover for sickness
6696048 the ability to offer a quality service is dictated by the staffing
6696049 the centre is working with more people with high dependencies and it is vital that staffing reflects these needs
6696050 users requiring one to one care should have that without reducing the availability of staff qualified to provide a quality service to other users
6696051 i have already been campaigning against cuts in the councils budget of 700 000 to re organise the services in centres for those with learning disabilities in the highlands
6696052 the new administration has the opportunity to rectify the matter by removing the threat of cuts which there is no chance will be delivered anyway even if that requires using some of the 17 million of reserves they hold
6696053 i am more determined than ever to ensure that the plans to
6696054 i was horrified to learn of the care commissions findings
6696055 i immediately raised the matter with the chair of the social work committee and i have had a number of discussions with her and the director since i want to see the current problems sorted out quickly and never recur
6696056 we cannot make cuts in services for the most vulnerable in our society when we are not even meeting their current needs
6696057 the last administration were wrong to try and do so and we now have a chance to put that right
6696058 i will support any moves review the budget to ensure we provide the services we want and the care commission are demanding

6696230 first step 1 purchase a gps system prices continue to drop which reduces the chance of getting lost and wasting fuel step 2 replace standard gps voices with pigtones gps voices that will definitely increase the smiles per gallon
6696231 its amazing how so few people knew that garmin gps and tom tom gps systems systems can have their standard voices so easily replaced of course we want pigtones to do for gps what ringtones did for cell phones
6696232 well we do call ourselves pigtones as in politically incorrect gps do we expect heat sure but if we can help someone get over any road rage by adding a few laughs to their trip itll all be worth it besides we are an equal opportunity offender we even have a contest that lets the driving public decide who we parody next
6696233 wilderness therapy programs for troubled teens typically cost 400 to 500 a day and last seven weeks on average then there are additional costs like for an escort the plane ticket gear and an educational consultant all of this can add up to tens of thousands of dollars

6696235 more likely to be found sipping champagne in a members bar than swigging cider in the student union slicas want the best unlike the traditional stereotypes that associate students to living on baked beans and house sharing in run down properties slicas want lifestyles usually associated with city workers stunning apartments with concierge services and central london locations
6696236 this research has highlighted that students have different aspirations and requirements so we are matching our customer expectations and adding a further choice to our existing portfolio of accommodation across the capital by providing premium student accommodation at excellent value for money although you would assume these customers come from more affluent backgrounds where paying for luxurious extras is the norm there is also a large proportion of students that just want to make the most of their student days

6696253 buyplexus com is unique because it benefits both the shopper and business owner
6696254 shoppers have a place to find the products or services theyre interested in and merchants can utilize the sites marketing tools to generate additional exposure in the search engines and social media networks weve created a powerful shopping portal in buyplexus com thats capable of rivaling some of the most popular online
6696255 the free business directory promotion is designed to allow more users to experience the benefits of the network and build a significant advertiser base weve had a great response so far
6696256 since buyplexus com was built with the new web 2 0 marketing standards in mind we were able to augment the listings with additional components like business blogs rss feeds google maps photo galleries reviews comments and social media functionality
6696257 our designers and developers knew savvy marketers would appreciate these extra features and they did a great job integrating them into the site
6696258 the goal with buyplexus is to enable anyone to post and search products and services not just business owners
6696259 many competitors simply dont allow people to take advantage of a networks popularity without paying high fees or having an established business so we made sure buyplexus was accessible to everyone and didnt exclude those users
6696260 we hope the launch of buyplexus com shows our continued commitment to being a resource for everyone not just our clients
6696261 in terms of advertising a business we know the best approach to marketing is a comprehensive one so buyplexus certainly meets that need by providing so many options

6696263 to combat dismal click through rates of traditional advertisements these features emulate widgets and encourage users to increase member adoption viral growth and brand interaction
6696264 while costly risky and foreign to brands the biggest missed opportunity for brands in social networks is to become part of the community interact and build real relationships
6696265 although we should expect interaction rates and viral spread to increase with engagement ads brands should wait and see how these ads click through rates perform
6696266 this announcement helps to set in place how online marketing will start to evolve
6696267 widgets have already become advertising units and now these advertisements are starting to become widgets
6696268 facebook must develop a client solution that will help optimize these tools with professional services based on data results and demographic information
6696269 marketers cant afford to experiment with their brand without the help of a trained and experienced group of social marketers provided by the platform
6696270 the comments around the ad dramatically increase engagement with the unit as the highly visible comments provide an opportunity for users to simultaneously draw attention to the ad by drawing attention to themselves
6696271 one of the most significant technology shifts that have accompanied convergence is the shift from conceptualizing service features as attributes of network devices to conceptualizing them as something hosted above the network feature hosting is an integral part of the whole convergence concept in fact

6696273 it would be nice to say that there was an explosion of innovation created to provide those answers nice but not true
6696274 so convergence players apparently had a problem getting a handle on how the whole thing was supposed to come together one can almost imagine all those vendors desperate for guidance floundering about in their labs then when all was dark came ims

6696280 in terms of the final result here i think that there is uncertainty
6696281 what happens is the arbitrator ends up splitting the difference between the unions request and managements more often than not it ends up costing the system more money
6696282 to leave it to a third party who may not completely appreciate and understand the system we feel is a risk
6696283 its great for once the ttc and our organization can agree on something
6696284 we cant afford to be shut down were already gridlocked when everything is running
6696285 the threat of a strike is almost as bad as a strike it looms over the public for months
6696286 it was related to not having provided enough diapers to properly care for the residents needs
6696287 this particular incident shows that we are determined to take action on these things as they arise
6696288 we have discovered that staff have been deliberately hoarding incontinent products in the residents closets dressers and in their clothing i e sleeves of coats jackets and sweaters
6696289 the front line staff has then been complaining that there are not enough of these products on hand for them to deliver incontinent care to our residents this is not acceptable and is an untrue statement
6696290 hoarding of supplies is theft and will not be tolerated
6696291 staff because they are busy or whatever will take product and hoard it in individual residents rooms and hide it why do they hide it because it is easier to hide it in a closet than it is to go to the trolley
6696292 if anything of this magnitude happens in the future how will firemen and ems know what buildings people with special needs are living in
6696293 one of the biggest problems is complacency you never think that its going to happen
6696294 people have to learn to get ready to have a grab bag with their medication cash water we have to go in and rescue pets but not things like cash
6696295 the safest place to be in any emergency situation is outside but there are some situations where its not necessary for all residents in every case to leave their building
6696296 one of the problems would be is everyone going to register
6696297 there is also a privacy issue if i have a heart condition that makes it hard for me to climb stairs i might not want to share that with strangers
6696298 it could be as simple as cleaning up the dust accumulated from the windows left open or repairing doors that were blown off
6696299 sufficient severity that we want that action changed right now
6696300 we want to be careful that we dont create a situation where people think oh geez this was an immediate comparable situation to what happened at sunrise
6696301 because that would be really misrepresenting the situation and would be unfair to these operators
6696302 we were up on our maintenance we just had everything inspected in the spring
6696303 it came from line 8 but sometimes product is transferred from one line to another
6696304 clearly the high food safety standards we have were not upheld and were doing everything we can to make sure appropriate measures are being taken
6696305 the products that tested positive for listeria were manufactured in july but we have recalled all the products that were manufactured on that line from june 2 on
6696306 the numbers seem to change from day to day some drop off the list some come back on the list
6696307 in one death listeria is listed as an underlying cause
6696308 in the second death it is not attributed to listeria but the person was infected
6696309 something like listeria infections comes down to food handling practices and following those properly to avoid the risk
6696310 the cooking process will kill listeria but if it the bacteria is in the environment of the plant the meat can be contaminated after it has been cooked but before it has been packaged
6696311 you can go quickly but you have to go carefully we were able to come forward with a probable cause in 2 1 2 weeks with a recall with very small number of cases
6696312 i dont know where the opposition is getting their information
6696313 in the grand scheme of things were not that bad off we make fairly good money and were able to buy a house but were barely floating
6696314 the average worker in ontario has less purchasing power than they did a year ago
6696315 certainly all the evidence points to the labour market going from bad to worse in ontario and that is likely to limit future wage increases
6696316 gasoline prices were the main factor behind the climb in consumer prices from july 2007 to july 2008
6696317 prices at the pump rose 28 6 per cent in the 12 months to july 2008
6696318 with staples like gas and food prices going up we expect to see the number of clients increase and we expect that those will be in the working poor area
6696319 about 28 per cent of the people who use food banks at least one person in the family is working
6696320 we think some of those inflationary influences will ease up as we go forward but it will still leave pretty squeezed household cash flows
6696321 deze bevinding is voor de unie van waterschappen aanleiding om tot de conclusie te komen dat het op dit moment onverantwoord is om de internetstemvoorziening voor de waterschapsverkiezingen in 2008 in te zetten
6696322 he loved his girls and it was very hard for him to go away
6696323 was loved by so many people his circle of friends stretch from coast to coast and his family both here and in ireland
6696324 he wanted his friends to have no fear for him because he had no fear of the mission in afghanistan we truly believe that if he came home safe that he would request to return for another tour
6696325 shawn was on his third mission in afghanistan he believed in what he was doing and he knew he was making a difference for the people there
6696326 its one of the things thats a risk when you sign up
6696327 they were well trained highly motivated crew who believed in the mission
6696328 the only way you can stop an insurgent from doing what an insurgent does is putting a 24 hour watch on the target we cant do that

6696333 in the last week or so the number of people getting in touch has shot up suggesting that august is the time when many people consider ending a relationship

6696367 a large percentage of the ones were replacing are fine but theres no simple way to know that unless we take them all apart

6696372 through relevant i reach a demographic that has strong faith morals and passion but disagreements politically
6696373 it wouldnt be wise for me to be seen as picking a political side when ive consistently said both sides are right in some areas and wrong in some areas
6696374 this generation of values voters doesnt necessarily need to draw political battle lines the way previous generations have and that we can work through areas of disagreement toward common goals
6696375 when antonio gates came to kent he hadnt really shown he had grown up yet but we had his former high school coach oronde taliafero as an assistant when he got here
6696376 that gave him someone he trusted to talk through problems and i think that made a huge difference for him he ended up being great
6696377 its feels great especially because we beat the previous record by over 200 pounds

6696398 its unusual to be asked what we are going to do ahead of a rate cut but on what we know today this is a pretty simple equation anz chief executive mike smith said
6696399 if funding costs continue at the current levels and the reserve bank do actually cut rates then there will be a full flow on to our mortgage customers
6696400 they follow them when they go up they should follow them when they go down he said
6696401 i expect the major banks to pass on rate cuts if and when the reserve bank takes that decision
6696402 its clear the findings have some wider implications for anzs management of other non traditional businesses particularly in our institutional division
6696403 this includes formal notes placed on employment records cuts to remuneration and the departure from anz of six managers and executives

6696428 through relevant i reach a demographic that has strong faith morals and passion but disagreements politically
6696429 it wouldnt be wise for me to be seen as picking a political side when ive consistently said both sides are right in some areas and wrong in some areas
6696430 this generation of values voters doesnt necessarily need to draw political battle lines the way previous generations have and that we can work through areas of disagreement toward common goals

6696448 well whose party broke it in the first place or even denied that it existed
6696449 it is becoming clearer by the day that internet users are increasingly turning to online live broadcasts as their first port of call when looking at important news stories developing around the world
6696450 with no need for satellite dishes pointing in the right direction set top boxes smart cards and expensive subscriptions people can now watch what matters most to them on their computers anywhere in the world
6696451 its strange to be following in the footsteps of angelina jolie shes amazing and if i can be anywhere near as good as her ill be happy
6696452 i went into a room and performed all my stuff such as somersaults back flips rolls all the things lara can do in the game i got a recall and performed all my stuff again this time in costume and i got the job
6696453 i would love to meet them but especially angelina shes brilliant and has always been a role model of mine i love her acting she is so very talented and beautiful before i even auditioned i watched the films over and over and played the video game to make sure i understood the character perfectly
6696454 well whose party broke it in the first place or even denied that it existed
6696455 this is a major breakthrough for older patients who have a worn out failing aortic valve and too many other medical problems to make conventional surgery a good option
6696456 with this new technology we can offer more patients a better prognosis sparing them surgery and a months long recovery period which all huge benefits especially if youre in your 80s or 90s
6696457 im actually hoping to join a gym after all this is over
6696458 mr burnard organised and attended promotional seminars at which investors were persuaded to invest in westpoint mezzanine companies
6696459 investors were afforded none of the protections which come from placing funds with a bank
6696460 the money belonging to the investors was placed at risk and ultimately most of the funds were lost in the westpoint collapse
6696461 im using a satellite thats orbiting the asteroid and the rotation of the asteroid itself to wrap this ribbon
6696462 so its kind of like it wraps as it rotates
6696463 what happens then is light from the sun shines on the body of the asteroid so more of it is reflected and it actually acts to move it away from the sun and the earth
6696464 its kind of like a very very bad day for earth
6696465 scientists say if it did impact the earth it would carry the force of 110 000 hiroshima bombs
6696466 at that time well probably be able to refine its orbit and determine how likely it is to hit the earth
6696467 if this one were to hit the earth you could say that most of life would be extinguished
6696468 we have asked the gymastics federation to look into what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepencies on this subject

6696476 i am sure that with goodwill we will be able to deliver on our programs
6696477 it will provide challenges to us it will be difficult for us but there is no sense of crisis in our approach to it
6696478 that the government cant ram things through without any scrutiny
6696479 if the government is so sure its good for motorists they can introduce it in nsw first where the motoring body nrma is supportive
6696480 after a year well have a look at what impact its had
6696481 if the senate has got so banal that your vote is under instruction from the lower house then we should save everybody a lot of money and just give up
6696482 its not for me to talk about names now but theres three or four boys who have pulled up pretty shabbily from the game last week
6696483 yeah one guy might have developed op osteitis pubis out of the game
6696484 its only the initial signs were not worried about it at all its just what happens in footy and we deal with it
6696485 all were saying is that weve got a couple of boys who have to get through fitness tests to play on sunday
6696486 our sides not settled yet it is friday and weve got some really sore boys from the way they pulled up from anz stadium last week
6696487 it may shock a few that there may be a couple out ive just got to see how they pull up today
6696488 weve done about 30 per cent more recovery this week than for any other game just from how they pulled up from the match
6696489 i think theres some serious clubs out there that think they would like to have another crack at geelong and they think they can beat us
6696490 and deep down i think north melbourne is one of them i think they have a genuine opinion that on their day they can beat geelong
6696491 i think were clearly better than some sides in the competition but i wouldnt say that about the top six
6696492 its a good game its a perfect game that we need going into the finals
6696493 last weeks game against sydney was a ripper and this one should be just the same
6696494 the one thing you do know about the kangaroos is when they turn up they normally play its not very often they dont
6696495 theyve been an amazing club as far as their ability to be very very competitive year in year out match by match
6696496 the significance of our study is that it identifies smurf1 as the signaling partner through which tnf does damage in ra related bone loss
6696497 that has enabled researchers to begin designing small molecule drugs to shut down the action of smurf 1 and its relatives furthermore since mice engineered to have less smurf1 expression develop thicker bones future drugs that shut down smurf1 may be also useful against more common forms of osteoporosis simply by changing the dose of course this is early stage work with many obstacles ahead but it is exciting nonetheless
6696498 our over all hypothesis is that in inflammatory diseases like ra the function of a group of enzymes like smurf1 gets turned on to cause proteasome degradation of key regulator proteins leading to bone loss
6696499 the real future solution will involve a treatment that specifically addresses each of these
6696500 our results appear to demonstrate that vigabatrin induced satiety in these animals
6696501 given the growing obesity epidemic we felt that examining vigabatrins therapeutic efficacy for obesity was particularly relevant
6696502 the fact that these results occurred in genetically obese animals offers hope that this drug could potentially treat severe obesity
6696503 this would appear to be true even if the obesity results from binge eating as this disorder is characterized by eating patterns that are similar to drug taking patterns in those with cocaine dependency
6696504 with our technology we can image specific cells in real time with exquisite selectivity which allows us to track their location and movement and to count the apparent number of cells present we then use conventional mri to obtain a high resolution image that places the labeled cells in their anatomical context
6696505 the large background signal from mobile water and intrinsic tissue contrast differences can often make it challenging to unambiguously identify regions containing these metal ion labeled cells throughout the body which is the current state of the art
6696506 right now were using our technology to image key cell types involved in autoimmune diseases like type i diabetes but our cellular mri agents also can be adapted to label other cell types including cells from bone marrow and stem cells a key long term application of our technology is to label and monitor cell based therapeutics in humans
6696507 ideally we would label therapeutic cells with our cellular mri agents before they are implanted into a patient in this way we could use mri to visualize the movement of the therapeutic cells in the patient to monitor whether they migrate to and remain in the desired tissues
6696508 people dont consume as much calcium as nutritionists would like
6696509 and one reason for this is that foods high in calcium dont taste good to many people tweaking its taste could encourage a calcium deficient population to consume more of this key nutrient
6696510 by understanding how calcium is detected in the mouth we can either make it easier to consume by reducing its bad taste or even make pharmacological agents that make it taste better
6696511 most mice dislike calcium but we found a very unusual strain that drinks it avidly
6696512 by comparing the genes of this strain with other strains we were able to identify the two calcium taste genes
6696513 it remains to be seen if what we have discovered in mice the existence of two calcium taste genes holds true for humans
6696514 we know people have the sweet taste gene tas1r3 and the gene involved with the calcium sensing receptor casr we dont know if we have the same forms of genes as the mice have but it seems pretty likely they have the same function
6696515 there isnt a better word for it it is bitter perhaps even a little sour but its much more because there are actual receptors for calcium not just bitter or sour compounds
6696516 in tap water its fairly pleasant but at levels much above that the taste becomes increasingly bad
6696517 im not saying people cant take tablets to get enough calcium but eating real food is a great pleasure with salt sweet and fat the problem is to reduce intake without reducing palatability for calcium its a problem of being not palatable enough

6696534 mind you plants cant run away from bugs and other pests they need to deal with them one of the things they do is to release volatile substances into the air so as to attract predators of the bugs
6696535 genetic engineering modification gm of green leaf volatile production holds significant potential towards formulating environmentally friendly pest control strategies it also has important implications for manipulating food flavor
6696536 for example the aroma of virgin olive oil stems from the volatiles synthesized by olives by modifying the activity of enzymes that generate these substances it may be possible to alter the flavor of the resulting oils
6696537 our work shows how you can convert one enzyme to another and more importantly provides the needed information for modifying the glv production in plants
6696538 a notable strength of this manuscript is the combined use of structural and evolutionary biology to draw new insights regarding enzyme function these insights led to the striking demonstration that a single amino acid substitution converts one enzyme into another thereby showing how a single point mutation can contribute to the evolution of different biosynthetic pathways this begins to answer the long standing question as to how the same starting molecule can be converted into different products by enzymes that look strikingly similar
6696539 we have discovered that they are also present in marine animals such as sea anemone and corals however we do not know what they do in these organisms

6696543 i applaud dr yokel and his research team for earning such a prestigious award
6696544 it is an honor that the epa star program selected uk for the largest single grant it has ever awarded for nanotechnology research this award is a perfect example of why it is so important that kentucky has a world class research university as it shows that the leading faculty and researchers that we have been able to recruit and retain here at uk are among the best in the world

6696553 its not easy to give up smoking and because many people dont understand that nicotine is not harmful quite a lot of smokers attempt to quit using willpower alone unfortunately only three per cent of smokers who rely on willpower alone will successfully quit with the right support and treatment quitters can help double their chances of success
6696554 using niquitin when i was quitting was a massive help and im not sure if i would have come this far if it wasnt for the lozenges i quit with a mate who offered me huge support but combined with the lozenges its got to improve your chances of quitting successfully and for good popping one of these in my mouth when i get that urge for a cigarette takes away my craving and puts my mind on something else which is very important
6696555 if we pass this bill which the democrats irresponsibly oppose well solve this problem

6696588 my question is if people arent showing up for work why are they still employed by the federal government
6696589 theres no management consequence for them not showing up for work
6696590 and what that does is undermine the effectiveness of any organization
6696591 to me its a scathing indictment of the bush administration their total incompetence and mismanagement and disdain for government and running government
6696592 apparently they are so asleep at the wheel that theyre letting people go for months without any consequences
6696593 it is true that theres i think a certain lack of accountability in certain offices
6696594 everybody doesnt have the same mindset and work ethic to produce you kind of got to just acknowledge it but dont let it bring you down
6696595 we have received formal notification via military channels that russia has decided to halt international military cooperation events until further notice
6696596 everything depends on nato priorities the priority is for unconditional support of georgian president mikheil saakashvili then we wont be to blame for the bankrupting of the alliances relations with russia
6696597 russia no less than nato relies on this mutual cooperation nato is much more in need of russias support of its military actions in afghanistan where natos fate appears to be in the balance
6696598 the withdrawal has started at a pace that will have all the russian federations forces behind the line of our zone of responsibility by the end of aug 22

6696601 i had only ever been to one strip club before i went to new orleans to do that movie
6696602 yeah heck yes but then i thought well this is real research ive got to do this for the role man ive got to do this but yeah it was terrifying especially when i get there this guy was a doctor apparently he was an older man and they whip out the cocaine and they start doing cocaine on the desk and im like am i incriminating myself i mean i didnt do any of the cocaine okay i just went there to observe so that was scary it was in a nice hotel the guy who took us over had a key to the room so he just opened up and the doctor is just lying in the bed and he wasnt completely naked when we got in there but he certainly got naked
6696603 later franco would tell cage about all this and it would become the inspiration for when cages character in the movie a pimp called acid yellow snorts a line and then declares

6696610 we send collectors in uniform and collectors without uniform it depends on how the debtor reacts if we need to do it to collect a debt we send a collector wearing top hat and tails so his debt attracts more attention
6696611 the way these companies approach consumers often borders on being illegal
6696612 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

6696631 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6696632 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6696633 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6696634 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

6696664 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6696665 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal

6696693 the way things are panning out at this juncture it is a risk return pay off is seen in favour of investors but the caveat here is that we are banking on this kind of upsurge in crude to be maintained over 12 15 months because that is when the actual impact on the bottomline of cairn will be felt but looking at the way things are panning out globally i think it is a risk worth taking because the company has got everything in its favour right now the implementation is also unscheduled i guess on a longer term basis this is one of the stocks where people can safely invest their money in because the risk return metrics have seen favour of investor at the current juncture considering the current market scenario
6696694 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6696695 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6696696 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6696697 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6696698 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6696699 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6696700 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6696701 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6696702 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6696703 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6696704 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6696705 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6696706 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6696707 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6696708 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6696709 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6696710 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6696711 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6696712 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6696713 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6696714 oh well just put the 24 105 4l on the 40d then
6696715 anti shake feature built in camera due to lower shoudou the fuzzy images taken more fun
6696716 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6696717 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6696718 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6696719 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6696720 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

6696724 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6696725 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6696726 one great lens covering everything from wide angle to telephoto
6696727 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6696728 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6696729 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6696730 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6696731 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6696732 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6696733 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6696734 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6696735 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6696736 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6696737 they did this because they dont want us to come back
6696738 i stayed to defend our house they destroyed everything they burned our house and killed and stole our cattle
6696739 now well have to rebuild it i dont know where the money will come from to rebuild south ossetia probably from russia
6696740 i am about ready to be on an island we are going back into the smallville mythology a little bit and kind of explore how oliver became the green arrow why he is the green arrow and how he became so good at archery and all that stuff
6696741 we would like to thank those people living near the scene and the wider alton community who have shown tremendous spirit in offering shelter and comfort to all those involved
6696742 many rallied round last night to help those affected by the crash and gave support to residents evacuated from their homes most of whom will not be returning until the coach is removed the community pulled together and at one stage the village hall was opened to provide shelter
6696743 throughout last night and today great support has been shown to assist police and other emergency services and we would like to thank residents
6696744 that has been one big plus during the course of two a days is we have had good work against the schematics of what were going to see
6696745 there will certainly be some tweaks you play to yourself personnel wise
6696746 but you always have to be ready to adjust any opener is a best guess scenario
6696747 im from algeria originally so have always had a special connection with north africa ive travelled all over the world but there is nowhere else quite like marrakesh its the most thrilling and intriguing place and i cannot see myself leaving in a hurry
6696748 after growing up in africa i moved to the uk and learned english while working in the hotel and catering trade
6696749 sometimes new arrivals think marrakesh is dangerous but i totally disagree
6696750 my advice for first timers is come with an open mind and dont be afraid
6696751 c mo es posible que se dejara volar al avi n
6696752 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6696753 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6696754 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6696755 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6696756 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6696757 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6696758 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6696759 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6696760 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6696761 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6696762 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6696763 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6696764 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6696765 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6696766 who are open to doing something on the production side
6696767 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6696768 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6696769 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6696770 steel industry is definitely a buy on the current juncture because despite what is happening on the international phenomena on the pricing front i think the advantage for integrated players in india is definitely going to be visible and it is coming into foray in the coming few quarters but there could be shorter term impact on sail which is difficult to quantify at the current level one is the coking coal prices because we have no idea of how it is going to pan out and impact its bottomline from july onwards and that is when its exposure would be the most also the wage bill and which way it is going to impact because we are also clueless about that so i think considering these things and we are headed for an election year where the wage will have to be passed on to the staff of sail i would be very cautious on this counter and try to exit on all declines because probably amongst the large players this is one of the weakest players among that group so i would be cautious on that counter

6696778 at the end of the day i consider myself a professional and my boxers are very professional weve not come here to argue with anybody weve come here to try and win gold medals
6696779 id just like to thank everyone at home for all their texts messages on the internet and my phone hasnt stopped ringing
6696780 it means so much having so many people behind me im going to win gold
6696781 ive always said that if my heads right my weights good and my trainings gone okay i can beat anyone in the world
6696782 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6696783 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6696784 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6696785 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6696786 this crime is a particularly unpalatable one its motivated simply by greed
6696787 she said she didnt want him to suffer but he was going to turf them out and wasnt treating them as his own children

6696794 in double digit gmr infrastructure is probably one of the best stocks to really latch on to at the current juncture because the company is well capitalized it has got most of the money in hand to implement all its proposed projects the debt closure even at this kind of a level where infrastructure companies are managing to do debt closures in between 11 75 to 12 5 i think if the company manages to do that for most of its projects then it is going to be a multi bagger from here on but it is not going to happen in the next 3 4 months
6696795 on a longer term basis this is a company which is going to give you 20 25 cagr for next 3 5 years so if you have that kind of an appetite and risk vision i think this is one stock which one should latch on this is a contrast stock good asset base good balance sheet good cash in hand go in for it

6696808 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6696809 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6696810 and this is where i think tom could really help us out here
6696811 gosh hon i appreciate that and all but im not really sure what im supposed to do about the company problems it seems like you and roger have a pretty good handle on that im more at home in the store
6696812 what i think you dont understand tom is just how much all of us in the porn business really want to go legitimate
6696813 cmon roger you remember telling me how much you wanted to be the next steven spielberg when you started
6696814 and that you just sort of fell into skin flicks like all the rest of us
6696815 like it or not tom youre the one who can help us become legitimate
6696816 only because you dont want to youve been watching movies renting movies and screening movies for twenty years or more youve got that viewing thing going and some pretty big names have been in the store youve got a pretty good idea of how a movie is supposed to look and what its supposed to sound like
6696817 well maybe but thats still a long ways from being able to make one
6696818 roger you have all the practical experience you know how all the equipment is supposed to work for shooting for sound for editing youve done it all and youve got a pretty good feel for the technology of the new stuff and more than that you know how to deal with actors
6696819 im not so sure that strippers really count as actors
6696820 and besides ive never been in it for the money but that doesnt mean i dont respect the money are you suggesting that we can finance some sort of independent film project like were just going to show up at the sundance festival win a couple of awards and then turn into big time movie makers
6696821 i mean have you some of these films theyre total crap
6696822 heres a remake of the vivisection of vera which is sure to be awful i think theres something wrong with remaking movies and japans gift to world cinema hiromitsu matsuda is back in the northwest introducing one of his gross out terror flicks
6696823 but hamas the best those movies he made with shishido are great
6696824 my point is that all these are just dumb horror flicks
6696825 or cops and robbers just trying to earn new credibility by being edgy about sex but theyre just plain dumb and for that everybody loves them nobodys as edgy about sex as we are and yet we get editorials written about how were the ones destroying society every couple of months somebody starts up a campaign to try to run us out of town and im getting tired of it from what i see here all we really need to do is put a few more clothes on have tom cook up some artsy fartsy gangster stories and well get into all these film festivals ourselves im tired of being a piranha
6696826 of course do you want to make movies or dont you
6696827 of course i want to make movies and im all for making something better than porn i just never really saw myself as legitimate i just realized that you do
6696828 no its cool i like it its nice to hear you say that so you dont want to make any more skin flicks
6696829 although strictly speaking i guess its true mom never hardly knew dad
6696830 the money the girls the booze the party never ends
6696831 do you remember all that trouble on the set of the dentist movie
6696832 and then i remember the words of a famous hunter
6696833 we ended up taking most of the accident out of the ending but ive watched those sections while doing the editing and they are seriously funny
6696834 my point is that we should have left it in
6696835 it was complete humiliation dawn wouldnt come out of the bathroom for hours
6696836 yeah filled with all kinds of pranks and pratfalls but the catch is everybodys naked
6696837 think of water balloons and cream puff pies that cant hurt anyone itd be a riot
6696838 i dunno seems kind of twisted to me thats the perspective of a former actress as a producer i can almost see it
6696839 but i think itd be a good idea for about one film at the absolute tops itd have to be a surprise for the actors
6696840 but okay i think we can do it well do it as our farewell film to the industry before we rise again as legitimate movie makers
6696841 i really dont think itll be the last but ill take that chance
6696842 now we just have to come up with a story leading up to it do you think lil paul can get us into a bakery

6697028 im using a satellite thats orbiting the asteroid and the rotation of the asteroid itself to wrap this ribbon
6697029 so its kind of like it wraps as it rotates
6697030 what happens then is light from the sun shines on the body of the asteroid so more of it is reflected and it actually acts to move it away from the sun and the earth
6697031 its kind of like a very very bad day for earth
6697032 scientists say if it did impact the earth it would carry the force of 110 000 hiroshima bombs

6697088 thats one of those decisions you question as a head coach why i even had him in there that he went home just once this summer and only for a few days for his brothers high school graduation mostly he trained and rehabilitated and went to class day after day
6697089 they tried to teach me what to do to stay at byu but really it had to come from within

6697091 i feel close to the top of my game right now
6697092 he is a very good player but he hadnt demonstrated a lot of maturity
6697093 so to see what hes had to do and how hes grown it very special he wouldnt probably view it like this but to me its been kind of a defining moment in the kids life in terms of diligence perseverance and maybe maturity that hes demonstrated
6697094 im surprised like everyone else because i didnt realize he was sick
6697095 i didnt know gene personally but all of us can see the growth of the league over the last 20 30 years and gene had a lot to do with that
6697096 the reality of life for all the guys who have played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span

6697104 milf units that targeted villages have engaged in serious violations of international law and should be held to account

6697107 football in england is so big its like a religion people here love football its not the same in france
6697108 even some teams in the second division in france dont get the same big crowds as mansfield
6697109 english players prefer to stay in one area and travel one or two hours

6697119 but we have a lot to work for its looking like it could be a great season
6697120 ik ga er niet van uit dat dit nog misgaat

6697123 hes a real multidimensional quarterback and he makes you really prepare for him because hes really versatile no question that logan is the team to beat with jeff at quarterback
6697124 hes got a lot of upside a lot of potential
6697125 how good hes going to be largely depends on the improvements that he makes over the next few years what college hell play at depends on how he performs on the field this season
6697126 i set out to get stronger and i definitely feel that i did get stronger
6697127 i put on 15 pounds of muscle in the off season i feel like im smarter and that i can read defenses better than last season

6697243 since asian bodies are not the same as westerners there have been questions
6697244 given that there have been some discrepancies regarding her age that have come to light we have asked the fig to look into this matter
6697245 it is because of these discrepancies that we have asked for this investigation to start
6697246 since asian bodies are not the same as westerners there have been questions but there shouldnt be
6697247 my real age is 16 i dont care what other people say

6697254 i gave it the best shot i had and i didnt have any more
6697255 the figures clearly illustrate the continuing problem of growing personal debt levels in the uk
6697256 despite the global downturn flattening the growth of personal debt and uk gdp over the past few quarters debt levels continue to grow at a faster rate than the income the uk generates
6697257 if the property market and economy continue to weaken the current levels of personal debt will become unsustainable and there will be a marked increase in personal insolvencies
6697258 its something i have been thinking about for a period of time and due to recent injuries in the england camp the opportunity has arisen for me to play a role in this series

6697268 it closes the book on a very very sad tragedy
6697269 unfortunately those who are still alive will always suffer from his actions
6697270 youre probably thinking a normal teenager doesnt do this well ask dick
6697271 but she had been with her daughter that morning and was thinking if god forbid something happened to her daughter that someone would come forward and do the right thing
6697272 at the end of the day there was no way i was not going to put this girl first before whatever damage might be done to me
6697273 only she didnt know if she was going to get out
6697274 she knows it wouldnt have stopped he would have kept hitting her
6697275 all she could think about was she might not see her kids again
6697276 shes really all about her family i can picture that giving her strength
6697277 it just shows the mindset of the victim to not only stay calm and think on her feet to get out of the situation and to a safe place but to give us a good description
6697278 told them that scotts valley police had the vehicle impounded and they needed to come talk to us
6697279 we were going to serve the arrest warrant today but they beat us to it
6697280 i cant think of a purse snatch in at least five years
6697281 in most cases deserted wives are unable to provide much detail of their husbands the new registration form will have columns for social security number of the overseas husband passport details and id labour card details
6697282 we are hopeful this will act as a formidable deterrence for even habitual offenders as a database of all the marriages will also be maintained
6697283 a maximum number of the over 275 complaints that we have received is from punjab in about 24 cases financial assistance of usd 1000 each was provided by the indian embassies of australia new zealand and united states to aid in registration and representation for divorce suits
6697284 our efforts are just a trickle so far and much more needs to be done

6697288 no one was happy this took as long as it did
6697289 but in america you are innocent until proven guilty and things are not always as they appear to be every person police officer or not still has rights
6697290 my reaction is that the court system works too bloody slow
6697291 but there arent a lot of options what can we do given our responsibilities to every officers due process rights
6697292 it makes me angry but i dont see any way around it
6697293 it hasnt just been training ive really gotten the entire olympic experience which was what i wanted to take away from it no matter what the scores or rankings
6697294 i took some time off and realized that this is what i wanted i wasnt going to stop until i got to the olympics
6697295 ive been watching them since i was a little girl some of these girls have inspired me to be here
6697296 its shocking when i talked to mark tewksbury and he told me he was not allowed in and was sitting on the curb it made me think that when im not competing thats going to be me sitting on the curb
6697297 i thought youve got to be kidding me why wouldnt you let ex olympians in shouldnt those people automatically be included
6697298 i just think the coc still has somewhat of a disconnect with the athletes and this represents that
6697299 the bottom line is the primary focus of canada house is to act as a place for athletes and families to get together and be free of distractions and free of bothers
6697300 its unfortunate some of the athletes feel that way feelings are legitimate if thats how someone feels were just trying to be as fair as we possibly can
6697301 theres a reason for it but its still tough to swallow
6697302 the weakest of all weak things is a virtue which has not been tested in the fire
6697303 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 metres
6697304 if you know you put in the work youre going to dance and celebrate i dont think thats disrespectful
6697305 spielbergs absence will not hurt the games the beijing games are much stronger than individuals
6697306 for the first time foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china
6697307 have i been able to contribute to the olympic values
6697308 ever took himself and his own perfectness with such disconcerting seriousness as the modern white man

6697318 team gb incorporates athletes from england scotland wales and northern island a good thing too since the union jack was wrapped around the shoulders of rebecca adlington england swimming geraint thomas wales cycling and paddy barnes northern ireland boxing
6697319 the performance of team gb in the olympics is moving beyond the sublime and towards the ridiculous gushed the
6697320 we are british for heavens sake how are we supposed to cope with such a relentless diet of good news such an unprecedented glut of world beating performances
6697321 you never know with these crowds and these judges what they are going to do
6697322 hes one of the top 20 players in the nba if you ask me and hes even better for them because hes the man on that team
6697323 hes a tough guy to guard hes one of the more crafty players in the nba and he knows how to score
6697324 we have to limit their outside shooting theyre a very good outside shooting team and you have to limit manus penetration
6697325 when manu gets in the lane hes a very good player at creating for his teammates we have to do a great job of guarding pick and rolls
6697326 just knowing kobe i think hes going to take this kind of personally
6697327 thats just him were expecting the best out of kobe and were expecting the best out of all of them
6697328 live like no one else so later on you can live like no one else
6697329 living like no one else so one day you can live like no one else
6697330 live like no one else so later on you can live like no one else
6697331 living like no one else so one day you can live like no one else
6697332 i loved it i could see it screw up the africans i was at home and theyre out there getting cold
6697333 hey i live and train in victoria b c i train in this all year
6697334 i knew he was coming i didnt have time to let my guard down i didnt have time to pay attention i was just running hard to the line
6697335 the race went about as i expected i knew if i ran a smart race i could get through to the final i wont have trouble getting ready for the final
6697336 ive got to be smart if i can be smart ill be okay but its going to be a dogfight
6697337 because of the rain delay we had to do two warmups but the rain didnt affect me at all ive performed in it before
6697338 we need to slow down a bit and focus on our families but im not done and i hope mistys not done
6697339 it was just a last desperation attempt to try to beat someone
6697340 but i kinda knew you can get a sense that i wasnt going to do it but i would have been mad at myself if i hadnt done it and missed because of that
6697341 its a big disappointment obviously i came here hoping to contend for a medal with my best race that obviously wasnt my best race to not even get into that final was a huge disappointment
6697342 it was an all right start but i think i wasted too much energy off the start trying to go harder instead of faster maybe
6697343 i tried to pick it up around halfway and started to have the start of a good finish but then i just fell apart the last hundred metres
6697344 you never know if its mental or physical right after the race but i felt mentally prepared
6697345 this is a tiny little souvenir fan i picked up in a gift shop on sentosa in singapore in 2000 friends have looked but not seen these since i wonder if theyre still on sale only 7cm or just under 3 inches wide the fan depicts the fall of singapore to the japanese in world war ii with british soldiers signing the surrender papers ahhh the memories
6697346 i bought these stickers recently in london and they made laugh as im sure it would anyone thats travelled by tube in london for any length of time apologies for my dodgy photo but i hope you get the idea its all the excuses london underground feed you when there are delays hilarious
6697347 its tough to tell because the stagger is so big we were in lane 2 so we felt out of it but then when i rounded the bend we were in it connaughton said
6697348 were in a better lane six tomorrow in the middle things will be different
6697349 when youre in the middle of the track youre more in the race henry said
6697350 youve got more of a cushion both sides youre more in the mix
6697351 in the relay youve got to expect one or a couple of the favourites to drop out so basically you just want to focus on each other and thats what we did
6697352 we did ours and they did theirs and were really thinking about getting on the podium
6697353 always exciting to be at the games and out on that track
6697354 its usually in a topical lotion or a paste its not administered by mouth
6697355 its more about getting your manhood out and showing the other guys youre bigger than them he said

6697359 you train your whole life and you want to win you dont expect to lose
6697360 you dont want it to end this way but its all we could do
6697361 bolt set it off after that i just think the jamaican camp went crazy
6697362 its kind of the way its been happening to me this olympics
6697363 i didnt have anything left i dont know what to say
6697364 i have four more years if i can stay like this i just have to train hard
6697365 awesome as it was i think the door has been left open to us in some areas where we see an opportunity
6697366 create additional magic in some of the venues and try to create the atmosphere a festive exciting warm atmosphere for the athletes
6697367 it didnt start like we wanted to but we just kept digging and getting better each game

6697382 through relevant i reach a demographic that has strong faith morals and passion but disagreements politically
6697383 it wouldnt be wise for me to be seen as picking a political side when ive consistently said both sides are right in some areas and wrong in some areas
6697384 this generation of values voters doesnt necessarily need to draw political battle lines the way previous generations have and that we can work through areas of disagreement toward common goals
6697385 we are coming apart at the seams in every sense

6697406 i did it as a bit of a joke but there is a serious side to it
6697407 this legislation has not been changed since 2000 so were abiding by the rules before us
6697408 but now is a good time to see what changes might be advisable
6697409 the mcguinty government is committed to encouraging things that reduce congestion and help keep the environment clean
6697410 we dont want old legislation to be a barrier to green innovations
6697411 but we are hopeful the government will act fast so we dont have any interruptions to our eco friendly service in ontario
6697412 they could not produce sufficient documentation and evidence that they have the properly certified people dispensing the propane
6697413 but weve got to be absolutely assured and convinced and our inspector has got to be satisfied that everythings in accordance with the regulations
6697414 what id say is that theyre much more aggressive this fighting season than theyve been in the past
6697415 the situation in the theatre has deteriorated over the summer and this is another reflection of that
6697416 he loved his girls and it was very hard for him to go away
6697417 he just wanted to make a difference and believe that he was doing right and he had the support from his family and friends and that he was doing the right thing
6697418 exceptional canadians who made a selfless choice to serve their nation
6697419 the difference is theyre not holding any of the ground that they attack us on so in the case of an ied strike they will inflict some casualties but they dont control the road they inflicted the casualties on so really the net effect is zero other than it whittles away at our resolve
6697420 our soldiers believe in this mission they know what this is all about
6697421 at the end of the day the taliban are against things theyre not for anything theyre against human rights theyre against education theyre against health care theyre against women theyre just against human decency so if we leave these people if we leave the population of kandahar province in the hands of the taliban we just wont be performing our duty and our soldiers know that
6697422 we have incredible leaders and we learn from these events and we learn from the incidents and apply them to try and stay ahead of this enemy
6697423 they were a well trained highly motivated crew and believed in their mission
6697424 are they effective theyre slowing them down will we still see devices in culverts yes
6697425 the only way you can stop an insurgent from doing what an insurgent does is putting a 24 hour watch on the target we cant do that
6697426 because of the irrigation problems and the wet season and all that other stuff theres culverts all over the place for drainage
6697427 a new bank holiday would be very popular for britains workers who have fewer public holidays than anyone else in europe except romania but it could also bring in much needed revenue to around a million uk businesses
6697428 so far business lobby groups have stuck to their usual position of opposing anything that benefits staff including a new bank holiday but we urge these organisations to think outside the box and recognise the benefits that a new bank holiday could bring to many of their members

6697453 one is that we can avoid the ethical issues of stem cells because wisdom teeth are destined to be thrown away anyway
6697454 also we used teeth that had been extracted three years ago and had been preserved in a freezer that means that its easy for us to stock this source of stem cells
6697455 because extractions of wisdom teeth are commonly operated in dental clinics we can expect a lot of donors of stem cells

6697475 die ersten untersuchungen in einer experimentalanordnung erwiesen sich als sehr vielversprechend
6697476 anfang n chsten jahres soll die neue prothese zur verf gung stehen
6697477 the movie is set for release next year and its going to be a huge movie lionsgate recently announced that theyre putting a hundred million dollars into it
6697478 der handel und der umgang mit nicht zugelassenen pflanzenschutzmitteln d rfen nicht toleriert werden
6697479 we have got some very good coaches there who believe in the players and give them the right advice and as a young player you can believe in them too
6697480 every training session is in the right manner and it was the same for every game it is a really professional set up
6697481 former reserve team coach frankie bunn has gone to coventry city now but he was the main person who gave me the most personal advice and encouragement when i was coming through
6697482 paul power and alex gibson are both great coaches too and their record proves that because they have brought so many good players through in the last few years
6697483 being a manchester lad and a city fan myself it means the world to me to play for the club
6697484 i have been here since i was 11 and to come through the ranks with people like micah who i am closest to is special
6697485 micahs progress has given me great belief and it is fantastic to have him playing at the club with me and to see him playing for england
6697486 i believe in my own ability anyway but it is great to see your friends do well it wasnt a surprise because i have grown up with them and seen what they are capable of
6697487 it was stevie irelands time to break into the first team then the international set up then it was micahs time and hopefully all of that will happen to me someday too
6697488 it is a massive step up to the premiership from the reserves
6697489 but it is really about getting the confidence to express yourself in the way you do in the reserves and having the belief in your own ability that you can do the things that you can do there when you are in the first team
6697490 it is not easy but if you have got people around you encouraging you and telling you that you can make the step it becomes achievable
6697491 i prefer to play as a striker but at the moment for the first team i play on the left it is difficult in some ways but you adjust to it
6697492 i dont mind i will play anywhere for the club try to get used to it and give 100
6697493 i am nervous before every game but you just have to prepare yourself in the right way every time
6697494 you dont know who is watching and you have got to impress and perform well
6697495 the more first team games you play the more confidence you get
6697496 going on loan is a possibility for me i just want to play for manchester city but if going on loan makes me a better player and gives me more experience then so be it i will do it
6697497 in five years i hope to be an established premiership striker scoring goals every week that would be enough
6697498 all history is about roads until the airplane came along
6697499 the reason were sitting here today is because the road came through
6697500 it was the only way through the two counties after a flood that you didnt have to cross a river
6697501 when the military cut the road they werent just going off into uncharted territory
6697502 it looked very much like any other log home with a spinning wheel and a cast iron skillet
6697503 in the 1820s the cherokee nation was only a fraction of what it once was
6697504 then three things happened that were bad for the cherokees
6697505 the trail of tears really started on the front porch of every cherokee household
6697506 the worst conditions really were during the roundup when they used bayonets to herd them conditions were similar to civil war prison camps they werent quite as bad along the trip because they could travel and have food along the way
6697507 she was 13 and shed traveled with her family 1 800 miles
6697508 do you know how close that is to indian territory she died within sight of it
6697509 we were just too late to save it there is stuff all over northwest arkansas that we didnt know about three years ago from points east we know how far it was from there to here but the research is ongoing
6697510 his goal early in life was to be a stagecoach driver by age 19 he was a driver and owned his own livery
6697511 in 1840 gold was found in california and many people migrated to the west
6697512 in 1850 california threatens succession if there is no mail
6697513 and he had a couple of partners in the business one named wells and one named fargo
6697514 in one year he had accumulated 250 concord coaches and 500 other vehicles such as water wagons hay wagons and lighter celerity coaches
6697515 he had 3 000 tons of hay stored along 2 800 miles and water wells dug at relay posts 12 to 14 miles apart he hired 1 200 employees including superintendents road bosses drivers guards conductors keepers blacksmiths harness makers hostlers and clerks he spent 1 million which would now be 15 million he started with 146 stations and increased this to 200
6697516 he wore a top hat and a yellow duster and black pants stuffed into black boots
6697517 they traveled day and night giving new meaning to are we there yet
6697518 his wife ran the station there he built a hotel across the street and the stable set about where fayetteville city hall is today
6697519 the butterfield overland express was the first overland transcontinental mail by stagecoach
6697520 it was the longest stagecoach line in world history 2 812 miles the butterfield stage line was a major factor in the settlement of arkansas and the west before the civil war
6697521 troops march down the road and they encounter other troops thats where the battle happens thats what happened at pea ridge
6697522 the battle was there because of the road from st louis to fort smith everybody used the same road the army went up and down it many times going to the indian territory
6697523 pea ridge was the largest battle west of the mississippi
6697524 arkansas at that time was the hinterlands the frontier was 20 miles away
6697525 the road was only as wide as a wagon and marching at just four men across it took a long time
6697526 the parks visitor center is where curtis makes last stand
6697527 it was so loud they could hear it in fayetteville and springfield it was the first thunder in the ozarks in march it was artillery
6697528 it was stocked full of food pickles sardines oysters eggs
6697529 they were eating not fighting and their ammunition train was far behind they had no ammunition
6697530 the wire road got more use in december 1862 union brig gen frances herron on his way to fayetteville passed the body of his dead horse lying there from a previous battle they used these roads all the time
6697531 people from the same county fought on both sides the first washington artillery for the union was out of fayetteville
6697532 the only people left were those who had no way to go
6697533 that tears at society it was so bad in northwest arkansas they built fortified towns southern towns and northern towns and set up blockades of the mail for the most part it worked
6697534 it was very dangerous tough living for those who stayed here
6697535 dac ma njuri pe blog la tine nu comenta pe blog la mine
6697536 all the three ships are still moving and appear to be heading toward somali a warship has been dispatched to monitor and track the vessels
6697537 misc was informed that there has been a casualty onboard involving one of our filipino crew members during the boarding of the vessel by the hijackers we are unable to confirm this incident
6697538 the united nations is the only agency that can stop this menace the international community has to agree to find ways to solve this worsening problem that is the only way forward
6697539 im surprised like everyone else because i didnt realize he was sick
6697540 i didnt know gene personally but all of us can see the growth of the league over the last 20 30 years and gene had a lot to do with that
6697541 the reality of life for all the guys who have played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span
6697542 he was one of the first people to fight for free agency
6697543 being able to go out and shop the market as a player with no restrictions meant everything to me it allowed me to have financial security for me and my family
6697544 i hope to be one of the reading academys success stories
6697545 in our year theres only two of us from the academy who have professional contracts but there are a few other people who will be getting to do the same
6697546 the reading academy definitely does work the whole process is good because it means you bring through home grown talent you dont have to go out and spend money
6697547 i feel valued too we have some good people at reading
6697548 reading is almost a renaissance club and we werent one of the big hitters when it came to a youth programme
6697549 but we have made a lot of progress in a few years and we are looking to pay back the investment from the chairman john madejski
6697550 ideally you would want them in five days a week to progress fully
6697551 but they have school and its just not possible for their parents to bring them here every night its a huge commitment for a family when a kid is in the academy
6697552 there havent really been any boys who have broken through from the academy but were trying to change that
6697553 its massively important for the club and important for english football better english players will be better for the english game
6697554 the number of foreign players in english football has never really bothered me because reading has not really recruited many
6697555 but if i was in the academy at arsenal it might be different
6697556 they have a great set up probably the best in the country but because they set such high standards it is hard to break through theyve got such a good team

6697571 the patented meinl floatune tuning system used on these timbales works without having to drill into the shell the result is a voluminous timbale sound with a crisp and warm response cutting rim shots and a great cascara sound
6697572 for n90s mb 10 provides a vertical hand grip a secondary fully functional shutter release with a lock a different but quicker way for battery loading and the possibility to use cr123 type lithium batteries with optional battery tray ms 11 beside the battery tray ms 10 which comes with mb 10 spares can also be purchased this is an impressively hefty and solid piece of plastic it weighs 7 4 oz 210g without batteries the mb 10 is connected to the camera physically via the tripod socket and electronically via the contacts surrounding the cameras battery chamber which include 3 contacts for shutter release button 2 contacts for power source and a hidden power switch the mb 10 uses the battery chamber of the camera body just to reach the electrical contacts i guess and provides its own battery chamber loading batteries into the mb 10 is simple and quick at a press of a button the battery holder is ejected after loading or replacing with a back up battery tray pushing the tray back in and you are ready to go no fiddling with the small screw or emptying all your pockets to find a penny i found that with mb 10 attached my confidence in hand holding shots is substantially boosted i shot an intercollegiate fashion show lately the lighting is not very bright i used sb 26 and my favorite nikkor 80 200 2 8 zoom the shutter was at 1 30 second the lowest normal sync speed of my customized n90 at f 2 8 this gives about 1 stop underexposure if shot with ambient light only i wanted to use the slow shutter speed to capture slight motion blur of models in 10 rolls i shot using focal length mostly in 80 125mm range but occasionally 10 stretched to 200mm i found i have less than 3 of shots have perceivably camera shake this percentage is much smaller than those out of focus shots as i used the autofocus of the camera without mb 10 i wouldnt dared to use such low shutter speed for handhold shooting i have two pleasant surprises one is that i found that with mb 10 attached the horizontal handling of the camera becomes very pleasant as mb 10 extends the handgrip of the camera a little it with the added weight the camera is noticeably steadier for handholding shots the other surprise is that the build quality of mb 10 is better than i expected although i havent used the camera mb 10 on a tripod yet but i believe it will provide a better camera support on a tripod despite the added weight mb 10 hugs a camera snugly throughout the entire base of the camera and base of mb 10 provides a lager area of contact for the tripod
6697573 the acl injury is the biggest thing that changed me
6697574 it taught me how to work now i know how to work hard because it was so hard to get back
6697575 its a bright spot for me personally because i felt so bad last year in the scrimmage in fall camp when he got hurt
6697576 thats one of those decisions you question as a head coach why i even had him in there that he went home just once this summer and only for a few days for his brothers high school graduation mostly he trained and rehabilitated and went to class day after day
6697577 they tried to teach me what to do to stay at byu but really it had to come from within
6697578 i just told myself i have got to do it and if i dont do it i am not going to change so i did
6697579 i feel close to the top of my game right now
6697580 he is a very good player but he hadnt demonstrated a lot of maturity
6697581 so to see what hes had to do and how hes grown it very special he wouldnt probably view it like this but to me its been kind of a defining moment in the kids life in terms of diligence perseverance and maybe maturity that hes demonstrated
6697582 its always important to have something exciting for each key event that we have and this games convention is really gaining lots of lots of importance
6697583 e3 was the show in the past and lots of publishers including ourselves focused almost solely on e3 and all the news got disseminated from los angeles

6697588 hes tough because hes a big strong kid that throws the ball we and runs the ball well
6697589 hes a real multidimensional quarterback and he makes you really prepare for him because hes really versatile no question that logan is the team to beat with jeff at quarterback
6697590 hes got a lot of upside a lot of potential
6697591 how good hes going to be largely depends on the improvements that he makes over the next few years what college hell play at depends on how he performs on the field this season
6697592 i set out to get stronger and i definitely feel that i did get stronger
6697593 i put on 15 pounds of muscle in the off season i feel like im smarter and that i can read defenses better than last season
6697594 coach really does a good job with the offense and he does a great job with me
6697595 he really teaches me the offense and he gives me a lot of freedom
6697596 it was the jump start we needed or were a good enough team to have won anyway
6697597 maybe it took a little wind out of their sails maybe in jump started us but weve played so many games
6697598 it would have been easier had the second baseman caught it hed be backing up
6697599 it would have been easier had the second baseman caught it hed be backing up
6697600 you can look at it in two ways it was the jump start we needed or were a good enough team to have won anyway maybe it took a little wind out of their sails maybe in jump started us but weve played so many games
6697601 there are a lot of things we need to get better at
6697602 we have great experience and that certainly helps theres a fine line between wins and losses
6697603 but we have a lot to work for its looking like it could be a great season

6697624 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6697625 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field
6697626 he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game
6697627 even though hes not here with us in body in his spirit we have the strength to go on
6697628 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges
6697629 his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions
6697630 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6697631 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6697632 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6697633 through relevant i reach a demographic that has strong faith morals and passion but disagreements politically
6697634 it wouldnt be wise for me to be seen as picking a political side when ive consistently said both sides are right in some areas and wrong in some areas

6697640 it wouldnt be wise for me to be seen as picking a political side when ive consistently said both sides are right in some areas and wrong in some areas
6697641 i dont think it was a commodity bubble but there was speculative excess in commodities that caused the market to move up too quickly
6697642 that doesnt really alter the big picture which is that commodities have established themselves as an asset class and that global demand for them will continue to be strong even though we had some demand destruction obviously in the energy sector due to high prices
6697643 the weak dollar is a major factor in the commodities markets today
6697644 and again we came out of the match without it
6697645 never in my wildest dreams would i have thought that i would have scored the goal that gave us the gold medal
6697646 you hear those words all the time but i really couldnt fathom it its like a storybook ending its something you see in hollywood or in fairy tales but it really played out my life doesnt play out like that all the time
6697647 one gold medal cant make up for that but this completes the journey
6697648 this legislation has not been changed since 2000 so were abiding by the rules before us
6697649 but now is a good time to see what changes might be advisable
6697650 the mcguinty government is committed to encouraging things that reduce congestion and help keep the environment clean
6697651 we dont want old legislation to be a barrier to green innovations
6697652 but we are hopeful the government will act fast so we dont have any interruptions to our eco friendly service in ontario

6697659 when the u s lost three and a half thousand people on sept 11th russia became the first country to express its support
6697660 for south ossetia to lose 1 500 or 2 000 people today is a terrible tragedy but no one knows about it
6697661 so many of my pupils have died they killed so many beautiful girls
6697662 i cant remember an issue over which the russians have been so engaged in trying to shape public discourse
6697663 the truth with respect to georgia is pretty clear for all to see
6697664 i thought it had to be a hoax because it was all of a sudden
6697665 i tried to search online and find some more information when i discovered it was true it was very sad to hear
6697666 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6697667 from what i hear he was a pretty good player
6697668 i wasnt aware of it i saw him at the hall of fame and he said he was feeling fine
6697669 he looked a little thinner than usual but he never indicated to me that he was struggling with anything

6697673 if need be we will move and relocate the nano project elsewhere relocation will cost both the tatas and the west bengal government but i will not bring my employees here if they will be beaten up
6697674 we want to understand why tatas are unwanted in west bengal i hope west bengal does not get characterised as a troubled spot in india
6697675 we have plans to launch the nano by october 2008 but many do not want that to happen
6697676 ratan tata told me that the company will not pull out of the singur project unless forced to do so a lot of investments have already been made in the project and until and unless he was forced to pull out he will continue with the project
6697677 i tried to assure him that as far as the state governments discussion with trinamool congress was concerned the party will not create any law and order problem and the agitation will be peaceful
6697678 he tata is quite worried he did not anticipate that such kind of things will happen to such kind of a project

6697702 when there is a gap between ones real and ones declared aims one turns as it were instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms like a cuttlefish squirting out ink
6697703 in our age there is no such thing as keeping out of politics all issues are political issues and politics itself is a mass of lies evasions folly hatred and schizophrenia
6697704 in our time political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible

6697708 charlie chaplin could do a better job running the home office than this labour government
6697709 the government will no doubt seek to blame private contractors but the rash of data losses over the last two years confirm that there is something much more worrying at stake this government cannot keep any information safe

6697717 the mtc was established in 1999 to basically run trader markets and public transport facilities but this mandate has grown and become wider and wider as we came to understand our customers better and better
6697718 it represents a new exciting and far reaching concept our vision is to see the centre providing health services to more than 500 000 people yearly
6697719 we know that the government alone cannot improve the lives of residents but it is through partnerships like these that we come to realise this goal

6697764 but she had been with her daughter that morning and was thinking if god forbid something happened to her daughter that someone would come forward and do the right thing
6697765 at the end of the day there was no way i was not going to put this girl first before whatever damage might be done to me

6697774 the list of artists and contributors who have graced the pages of arkitip now reads like a whos who of popular culture many of which received exposure in arkitip long before the mainstream took notice
6697775 we have taken the responsibility to help communities around our mining area
6697776 even though kgotla offices are not the only problems that you have we decided to start here
6697777 we cannot make the problems disappear but if we work together things can be easier
6697778 we want to know where they come from and how they live where they come from so we can better situations in any way we can
6697779 the kgotla offices were already in the development plan so this means that we can remove the project and add another one there
6697780 timeliness is an important thing if all projects can be done this fast things will progress
6697781 it is better to do something for the people than to hand out a cheque
6697782 each day is a grind and sometimes things dont go your way when you struggle you just keep at it
6697783 i had to battle and the double plays were a big part of it
6697784 i had the chance to drive in the games first run and didnt do it and that changes the whole game right there
6697785 when i have that chance i have to come through
6697786 that says a lot obviously this is a lot different team with ken griffey jr and adam dunn gone but we still have to produce runs we cant use that as an excuse we had chances and we do have people capable of doing it
6697787 for years they have been having to make do in buildings that were built for other reasons theres inadequate bathrooms inadequate waiting rooms and people are piled on top of each other
6697788 theyre being forced to wait in rooms that are not secure
6697789 theres no consideration right now for how the community experiences the courthouse visit
6697790 only she didnt know if she was going to get out
6697791 she knows it wouldnt have stopped he would have kept hitting her
6697792 all she could think about was she might not see her kids again
6697793 shes really all about her family i can picture that giving her strength
6697794 it just shows the mindset of the victim to not only stay calm and think on her feet to get out of the situation and to a safe place but to give us a good description
6697795 it just seems to kind of regulate his system when he gets more of this physical activity hes more relaxed
6697796 its just nice to be around other parents who can relate to what youre going through

6697805 my reaction is that the court system works too bloody slow
6697806 but there arent a lot of options what can we do given our responsibilities to every officers due process rights

6697810 were looking at a petrol price cut of maybe just under r1 but it will be based on the petrol over recovery and then dependant on whether the department of minerals and energy dme changes wholesale or retail margins
6697811 the oil price is massively off its highs from about two months ago and is currently standing at 115 per barrel
6697812 there has also been a sharp retrace in commodity prices effecting minerals such as gold platinum and copper
6697813 the softening commodity prices have shown the reserve bank that inflation risks have not disappeared entirely but have softened
6697814 now the difficult question is whether the oil price is in a temporary pull back or not
6697815 but the oil prices after dropping significantly in the past month does seem to have found a stabilising base
6697816 we expect an interest rate cut only in the second quarter of 2009 with inflation peaking at about 13 percent
6697817 the softening commodity prices will help to ease inflation but it has a negative impact on the countrys economy as a prosperous mining sector feeds into a number of other sectors
6697818 platinum which is our biggest export value is down significantly to 1396 per ounce while gold is down 200 already to 823 per ounce
6697819 oil and copper is down but coal has been holding up extremely well
6697820 so they can receive a higher amount in the future and make the enterprise grow
6697821 we cant vote in a new committee the rasina tlhomelang led committee has been successful in securing sponsorship for the awards and electing a new committee might reverse their achievements something that would not help us as artists
6697822 we are told that one of them hired people to transport bomu members and sound systems on his own flouting the tendering system this is amateurish and greedy we need to have a balanced committee thus with elderly people to keep these youthful guys in check otherwise we will always be in conflict
6697823 we have sent draft copies of an alternative constitution that could be used to all musicians it is imperative that bomu has a clear constitution it is only through that that we can avoid this kind of situation right now we have amassed a lot of sponsorship from different organisations if we step a side for a new committee there will be a lot of setbacks
6697824 brings sales financial management banking purchasing manufacturing inventory management and customer relationship management under one flexible responsive system
6697825 we are seeing exceptional demand and it is being driven by a newly confident africa
6697826 infrastructure and resource projects are driving growth for those smes whose products and quality systems stack up in turn retail sales have grown through much of africa which is a boon to manufacturers and distributors
6697827 as far as this reflects a loss of confidence by the business sector it is in sharp contrast to the findings of the business expectations survey
6697828 confidence levels were high with exporters registering an average 78 percent non exporters 71 percent
6697829 however since then unscheduled power cuts and upward revisions of power company tariffs as south africa cuts exports of power to its neighbours have affected confidence in botswanas growth prospects
6697830 the bank suggests that a 15 percent across the board increases awarded post budget to civil servants is behind growing upward pressure on wages throughout the economy
6697831 although botswanas non mining economy is improving its share of the overall economy is not
6697832 despite the better fortunes of the non mining sector and the continuing fall in diamond revenue mining is the only sector apart from hotels and restaurants that is taking a larger share of the economy
6697833 it may well reinforce botswanas dependency on diamonds but not only those mined in botswana
6697834 the dtc botswana will not be dependent on mines in botswana
6697835 so far during 2008 dtc has seen strong and continuing consumer demand for most categories of polished diamonds especially in the larger goods
6697836 the dtc takes a long term sustainable view on its pricing and decisions are influenced first and foremost by demand for polished gems

6697850 what you find is people come in for free and eventually move up to paying for a more full featured product
6697851 adds an inappropriate level of review which unnecessarily limits the governors discretion to decide the parole of a convicted murderer based on what is in the best interest of public safety
6697852 a cold premeditated murder carried out in an especially cruel manner and committed for an incredibly petty reason
6697853 indeed it is not the circumstance that the crime is particularly egregious that makes a prisoner unsuitable for parole
6697854 it is the implication concerning future dangerousness that derives from the prisoner having committed that crime
6697855 upon the inmates current dangerousness should not produce a wave of reversals of decisions denying parole
6697856 the awesome responsibility of deciding whether to release a convicted murderer on parole lies with the executive branch not the judicial branch
6697857 gov schwarzenegger will continue to consider each of these lifer cases individually and based on the entirety of their record including original crime and time in prison will decide whether or not a lifer inmate poses an unreasonable safety risk to our communities if released

6697882 charlie chaplin could do a better job of running the home office than this labour government
6697883 the home office is entrusted with a great deal of highly confidential material and it seems to be entirely incapable of keeping it secure and the consequences are very serious theyre serious because it may lead to the identity of the people involved being revealed
6697884 one of the possible consequences is that criminals will bring legal actions against the government and the taxpayer will then have to pay damages to people who appear to be pretty undeserving because of the governments incompetence
6697885 if you hand out memory sticks almost like confetti to companies that are meant to do research for you then you need to be absolutely certain that when you give such information away the company concerned have put into practice procedures that are just as robust as the procedures that i hope the government has followed since the loss of the child benefit data
6697886 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses more personal information has been reported lost it is vital that sensitive information such as prisoner records is held securely at all times
6697887 the home office has informed us that an internal report will be carried out into the data security arrangements between the home office and its contractor pa consulting
6697888 for years they have been having to make do in buildings that were built for other reasons theres inadequate bathrooms inadequate waiting rooms and people are piled on top of each other

6697924 as scotlands national orchestra we naturally travel an enormous amount so a partnership with first scotrail is highly appropriate for us and with green issues and petrol prices in the front of peoples minds at present this is a very timely new relationship indeed we are most grateful to first scotrail for their support of our work taking music right across scotland and we look forward to a very fruitful partnership over the coming year
6697925 this sponsorship reflects our ongoing commitment to the arts music and culture in scotland the royal scottish national orchestra presents concerts across scotland and with services running throughout the country there are lots of opportunities for families and friends to travel by train and enjoy a fantastic day or night out

6698134 f r unsere studie haben wir die genome von mehr als 10 000 erwachsenen und kindern aus ganz deutschland untersucht
6698135 these simulations show that young stars can form in the neighbourhood of supermassive black holes as long as there is a reasonable supply of massive clouds of gas from further out in the galaxy
6698136 the crucial element was the modelling of the heating and cooling of the gas as this tells us how much mass is needed for part of the gas to have enough gravity to overcome its own gas pressure and thus form a star
6698137 that the stars currently present around the galaxys supermassive black hole have relatively short lifetimes of 10 million years suggests that this process is likely to be repetitive such a steady supply of stars into the vicinity of the black hole and a diet of gas directly accreted by the black hole may help us understand the origin of supermassive black holes in our and other galaxies in the universe

6698163 ik heb net mijn vrouw jolanda gebeld zij is jarig en zei dat ik haar geen mooier cadeau had kunnen geven dan deze uitspraak de afgelopen drie weken hebben voor mijn gevoel vier jaar geduurd ik ben door een hel gegaan ik ben vanaf het begin van iets beschuldigd waar ik niet schuldig aan ben maar het is moeilijk mensen daarvan te overtuigen dat het nu toch is gelukt is een enorme opluchting ik kan me eindelijk weer op het leuke richten het begin van de competitie
6698164 ik heb altijd gezegd dat deze zaak voor niemand gevolgen zal hebben ik zal psv en vvv niet n twee drie weer fluiten denk ik maar als ik die jongens tegenkom zal ik ze hetzelfde behandelen als de andere 21 spelers
6698165 hier in peking heb ik nog wat last van een achillespees maar ik verwacht zondag geen problemen
6698166 de voorspelling is dat het warmer wordt dat is ongunstig voor de marathon
6698167 ik deed er een duurloop van 80 minuten en verloor drie liter vocht daar valt niet tegenop te drinken
6698168 creio que as condi es que o pa s prestou aos atletas permitiriam ter resultados diferentes daqueles que foram alcan ados
6698169 que j apresentaram em competi es internacionais resultados desportivos muito superiores quilo que neste momento fizeram
6698170 focus on your goal and have strong determination i know god pay for your effort
6698171 its going to take a lot of explanation for these folks to understand
6698172 the army and police arrested a suspected bomber not far away from scene of the attack
6698173 they also recovered a suicide jacket from a nearby mosque and seized explosives
6698174 the army has killed hundreds of innocent people and we attacked it to teach it a lesson

6698177 he has sex and did drugs with a homeless guy
6698178 i am so very pleased with my new look home i was genuinely surprised at how much improvement work was carried out within my home which has made a huge difference to the feel and look of it
6698179 the contractors were always polite cleaned up after themselves and left no mess i really appreciate the decent homes programme i couldnt have afforded to carry out these wonderful refurbishments privately thank you so much
6698180 we reached our first 100th milestone and look forward to delivering decent homes to thousands of tenants during the five year programme
6698181 its most satisfying to see the high standard of work that is being delivered to tenants homes
6698182 it is early days for our decent home investment but it is good to see this first important milestone reached ahead of programme
6698183 we will be making sure we learn from these early experiences to further improve the decent homes programme for all of our residents
6698184 as a former resident of ladbroke grove i have watched the notting hill carnival grow from strength to strength each year to become an internationally acclaimed event
6698185 with the olympic ceremonial handover from beijing to london taking place on august 24th notting hill carnival is truly welcoming the world on behalf of the capital
6698186 nothing beats the sounds of the steel pans the aroma of delicious caribbean food and the dazzling colours of the costume parade
6698187 for these reasons and many more i would like to invite every londoner to come and enjoy the fantastic carnival atmosphere over the bank holiday weekend
6698188 over the bank holiday weekend hundreds of thousands of londoners will have a great time in what promises to be a spectacular event
6698189 the carnival has always been a fantastic draw for international visitors to london and this years theme welcoming the world acknowledges this worldwide appeal
6698190 we are delighted to once again be at this years notting hill carnival raising awareness of the shortage of registered bone marrow donors
6698191 it took me about 15 minutes on the bike which is roughly what it takes me in the car
6698192 cycling to work takes a bit more planning than simply jumping in the car but even if its not practical every day i will certainly think about cycling in again
6698193 my children in particular have really been getting involved and its been quite an eye opener to see how even little things like only half filling the kettle instead of filling it to the top can save a lot of energy
6698194 as l amp q grows it is increasingly important that we take sustainability seriously and every member of staff can contribute by making simple lifestyle changes that will help to reduce our environmental impact
6698195 obviously its not possible for everyone to cycle in to work but even if you take the bus or train a couple of times a week instead of driving it will be a help
6698196 there are also little things that people can do around the office and at home such as switching off computer monitors not leaving lights on unnecessarily and making sure taps are turned off properly that all add up
6698197 it was brilliant to see the executive group saddle up this morning and leave the cars at home my biggest relief though is that none of them turned up in lycra cycling shorts
6698198 oh well lets go down to the spooky old field he seems to have bought just before he died
6698199 tan se puede que la ley org nica de la universidad se ala que es el consejo general universitario el que tiene la facultad no s lo de elegirlo y designarlo sino tambi n en su caso removerlo ese es un debate que se tiene que dar en donde ya hay diversas voces posicionamientos
6698200 es un d a importante porque habr temas importantes para la universidad de guadalajara es el consejo general el que se llevar a cabo y en ese sentido habr a que esperar a que un n mero de consejeros importante pueda reunirse para analizar la posibilidad de que el rector ha cometido faltas graves o no
6698201 los elementos se van acumulando a trav s del tiempo esto definitivamente es un acto muy grave por supuesto es un hecho que est por parte de la ley org nica vamos no est permitido ese tipo de alianzas que l est llevando a cabo ponen en riesgo a la universidad
6698202 the cache and the total number of weapons recovered along with the enemy killed convinced me that it was a good operation
6698203 la premura de ver resultados la exigencia de sentir m s seguridad no puede esperar a la creaci n del observatorio ciudadano
6698204 por eso convocamos a que en 100 d as revisemos el cumplimiento del acuerdo nacional a que las universidades y otras instituciones educativas nos ayuden a evaluar los avances en cada uno de los compromisos que hoy hicieron ustedes de cara a la sociedad
6698205 la impunidad ha sido un incentivo para la delincuencia es asunto rentable para la delincuencia
6698206 la delincuencia tiene poder de intimidaci n cooptaci n y b squeda de control social y territorial basado en la corrupci n
6698207 el acuerdo es un mecanismo de los tres poderes y tres rdenes de gobierno a fin de que cada uno desarrolle acciones espec ficas en favor de la seguridad
6698208 en materia de secuestro se crear n unidades especializadas para desarticular a las bandas dedicadas al secuestro e intercambiar informaci n al respecto as como la implementaci n del sistema nico de informaci n sobre delincuencia organizada
6698209 incide de nuevo contra las inversiones requeridas para la penetraci n y cobertura de los servicios del sector al plantear condiciones de interconexi n sumamente desventajosas e ilegales
6698210 toda vez que es muy raro o casi imposible que dos concesionarios no puedan convenir en la totalidad de un convenio de interconexi n que adem s se viene celebrando en t rminos no discriminatorios
6698211 la f rmula sugerida para el c lculo del desbalance implica una tarifa de interconexi n desigual
6698212 es evidente que el control por parte de telmex y telcel de los recursos esenciales les ha permitido a trav s de los a os controlar los servicios intermedios de interconexi n y as frenar y obstaculizar la prestaci n de servicios por parte de sus competidores
6698213 un derecho residual protegido por una regla de propiedad que pudiera desincentivar el realizar inversiones incrementales con riesgos
6698214 the worlds pretty serious right now and theres an ironic lightness in virulents
6698215 theres a touch of macabre ridiculousness to it i think weve seen a lot of attempts to make serious movies about serious things and it strikes me that we might be a little more artful about how we make a point these days

6698223 millions of people will get a huge shock when they realise how much it will cost to heat their homes this winter for the most vulnerable people the effect will be devastating
6698224 one by one the major energy companies are lining up to clobber customers with enormous price rises
6698225 it is unacceptable that on this governments watch these companies have benefited from a 9 billion windfall yet they continue to turn the screws on people who are already struggling with high prices
6698226 energy companies should be compelled to put some of this money back into insulating the homes of their poorest customers
6698227 yo di el 100 por ciento era una competencia que esperaba en toda mi vida y puse todo mi esfuerzo por eso me voy con la cara en alto y contenta

6698229 this is a massive breakthrough which will see all tube cleaners paid the london living wage by next april at the latest
6698230 we would have liked to have seen 7 45 implemented immediately for all but on tubelines contracts we have secured an immediate minimum increase of 60p an hour with the rest following by next april
6698231 that is a massive improvement on the prospect presented by the mayor of having to wait for contracts to be re negotiated which would have left some of our members waiting until 2012
6698232 tubelines have today also assured us that they will take over the entire responsibility for funding the london living wage on their contracts from 2010 and in our view that should give an ideal opportunity for tubelines to take its cleaning back in house
6698233 as a result of this breakthrough the rmt executive has today agreed to suspend the 48 hour strike scheduled to begin tomorrow
6698234 there are other issues that remain to be dealt with as well as internal funding issues arrangements between contractors and clients but our cleaning members have made a principled stand for a living wage and have conducted themselves in a way that is a credit to the entire trade union movement
6698235 i am sure that people will recognise that this result has been achieved by taking united action and that this is a fantastic result for workers we were told would never be organised

6698249 no vamos a avalar el vaciamiento y el robo de aerol neas argentinas perpetrado por el grupo marsans en connivencia con los funcionarios de la secretar a de transporte
6698250 esta ley es un superpoder porque autoriza partidas que nadie conoce
6698251 lo que dijo la oposici n sobre aerol neas es lamentable la cc y el pro hacen referencia al punto 2 del proyecto oficial que ya no existe la nica propuesta que acercaron fue la que present el senador radical morales y tambi n es lamentable favorece a los intereses chilenos y no a los argentinos

6698315 through relevant i reach a demographic that has strong faith morals and passion but disagreements politically
6698316 it wouldnt be wise for me to be seen as picking a political side when ive consistently said both sides are right in some areas and wrong in some areas
6698317 this generation of values voters doesnt necessarily need to draw political battle lines the way previous generations have and that we can work through areas of disagreement toward common goals
6698318 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6698319 they are working on a plan that looks lo and behold like the plan that ive been advocating i will encourage the administration to move forward with it
6698320 were monitoring closely and will have something to say when an agreement is finalized
6698321 at this point obama looks a little less reckless than he might have a few months ago

6698323 between now and election day not a lot of troops are going to come home
6698324 has made it clear he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq
6698325 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines
6698326 there was a time that i was so far away from even dreaming of this
6698327 that this has happened that it was possible for me it involved so many people other than just me the people who have supported me and stood by me and encouraged me to move on and be the best that i can be
6698328 to really show such great support in a time when it was so easy not to support me i do think of them thats where the tears come from
6698329 school was no good for me my mother was no good for me nothing was good i had nothing to lose i went on an adventure
6698330 i didnt have any money to be in the sport i didnt have a family buying me horses i was kind of the poor kid around the block just showing up and seeing what somebody would give me
6698331 im a very unusual character to have come in the sport i will say that you dont see it often
6698332 the rules are made for everyone else is his attitude
6698333 what they wanted to do with me was take my livelihood away and everything else
6698334 and i dont think thats constructive for somebody whos struggling to take their passion away i feel very strongly about that and thats what i feel was the biggest lesson to be learned is that everybody does deserve a second chance or a third chance if you believe they can actually come back and do some good in my case i had a lot of people believing in me
6698335 my story can show young people it doesnt matter what happens you can go bankrupt you can have a drug problem you can have an alcohol problem you can make a terrible mistake whatever
6698336 theres a chance to come back and redeem yourself in life and put the pieces back together

6698347 we want everyone to know the truth about the terrible events in tskhinvali with the hope that such a thing will never again happen on our land
6698348 despite its reputation for sunny hot and muggy weather august actually is the second wettest month of the year in galveston county it turns out that the heavy rains weve seen over the past couple of weeks are not that rare for this time of year

6698351 my main concern was to clear my name not about what punishment bertolino would get
6698352 i told the chief i would smile and take it for all the stuff i probably got away with over the years
6698353 if im now seated in the chair to gods right gods now comfortably seated in the chair on the left which is the chair of evil and gods evil is perfect gods evil is righteous gods evil is holy and gods evil will be done

6698360 we can rejoice that all the people of color on the earth know who the devil is and that he can not even find refuge in the hills of the lord

6698362 the white population of great britain has got to be on its knees to make things right the apology should be visible to show we accept that we effected the most awful wounds on a huge number of people
6698363 its vital that our children have a reminder of mans inhumanity to man
6698364 the important thing was to understand the brief and what the committee was aiming to commemorate with this memorial
6698365 there is a lack of knowledge and understanding about the history of africa the repercussion of slavery and what it meant for britain
6698366 this memorial will be an educational resource as the focus of curriculum based and life long learning
6698367 it will also serve within a broader context to highlight in a national and public setting the centrality of the experience of enslaved africans and their descendants in the history of britain this in turn will function as a focus for family and local history researchers
6698368 hyde park is a fitting site for a permanent memorial to the millions who lost their lives and the courageous people who fought to end the brutal transatlantic slave trade
6698369 time for a change we are the people we can do it

6698375 acai berries are among the most nutritious fruits of the amazon
6698376 i really want to bring kids back into the love of clowns
6698377 clowns have been absconded by popular media like it or stephen king even ronald mcdonald was frightening i want them to understand that clowns have good hearts and are just there to make you laugh
6698378 when you make love to a woman you get revenge for all the things that defeated you in life
6698379 i believe that this will be the largest multi day ticketed event in the history of san francisco
6698380 we have people coming to this festival from all over the united states and the world
6698381 the large event that this reminds us of is the us festival
6698382 we know that he had extended contact with the girl whos now 16
6698383 our concern is there may be additional victims because he clearly has no qualms about contacting girls who are significantly underage
6698384 amazingly enough weve received nothing but support from staff and people who know us
6698385 at what point will the message be sent that this kind of behavior will not be tolerated by teachers and other trusted members of our community

6698586 i really strongly believe in local bargaining but weve set this deadline because we dont want the uncertainty for school boards to go on forever
6698587 if we cant make an informal process work without it dragging on or getting nasty it will be extremely damaging to the relationship between boards and their employees

6698592 germany is now in a stronger position to play a bigger role in the european union in shaping the blocs long term relationship with russia and the caucasus
6698593 russia does listen to what germany says if germany can make clear statements about the consequences facing russia over georgia and whatever else it might decide to do it will have an impact on russia

6698667 theres no consideration right now for how the community experiences the courthouse visit
6698668 adds an inappropriate level of review which unnecessarily limits the governors discretion to decide the parole of a convicted murderer based on what is in the best interest of public safety
6698669 a cold premeditated murder carried out in an especially cruel manner and committed for an incredibly petty reason
6698670 indeed it is not the circumstance that the crime is particularly egregious that makes a prisoner unsuitable for parole
6698671 it is the implication concerning future dangerousness that derives from the prisoner having committed that crime
6698672 upon the inmates current dangerousness should not produce a wave of reversals of decisions denying parole
6698673 the awesome responsibility of deciding whether to release a convicted murderer on parole lies with the executive branch not the judicial branch
6698674 gov schwarzenegger will continue to consider each of these lifer cases individually and based on the entirety of their record including original crime and time in prison will decide whether or not a lifer inmate poses an unreasonable safety risk to our communities if released

6698693 marketing gurus create new terminology like ria and web 2 0 in order to force people to engage in new conversations without them dragging along their baggage of ingrained prejudices about what something is or is not
6698694 they also do it i am convinced to make themselves seem smart
6698695 first because like all things techy its already obsolete and second because its limiting
6698696 i love it because its now such a part of the common vernacular of web culture that when its used everyone immediately understands that you are talking about something better than primitive html websites
6698697 rias are impacting the way that companies like ebay ford random house viacom ge dow jones and nbc think about the internet and desktop software and are demonstrating how innovative thinking can completely change the way they do business

6698708 we are all wondering who has gone to such time and effort to build this
6698709 somebody could be using it as a fishing den we do get quite a lot of night fishing so its possible that someones decided to make it a bit more comfy
6698710 it could be youngsters using it as a bit of a hidey or potentially something a bit more sinister but wed rather hope not

6698715 intanto nove agenzie interinali di castelfranco affermano che con i giovani hanno a che fare certo ma per puri scopi di lucro come naturale che sia
6698716 due importanti ditte costruttrici della zona che spesso abbiamo visto tra i soggetti coinvolti dai progetti comunali e ci chiediamo davvero se in un progetto di questo tipo delle imprese edili fossero davvero indispensabili
6698717 uno studio legale e uno studio commercialistico davvero il comune non ha allinterno delle sue strutture chi pu dare consulenza legale e soprattutto un commercialista senza ricorrere a privati e soggetti esterni
6698718 e di questi affermano ben pochi lo sono veramente sono coinvolte le consulte giovanili di castelfranco loria godego e resana realt molto ridotte la maggiore delle quali quella di castelfranco possiamo dire che ha un legame molto scarso con i giovani del territorio ci chiediamo poi che ruolo concreto avranno le consulte se noi stessi che facciamo parte di quella di castelfranco siamo venuti a sapere del progetto quando tutto era gi chiuso e stabilito senza poterci mettere becco

6698728 we are very pleased that judge fogel has put content owners on notice ignore fair use at your peril
6698729 in order for a copyright owner to proceed under the dmca with a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorised by the copyright owner its agent or the law the owner must evaluate whether the material makes fair use of the copyright

6698748 south africa will offer five star luxury they will offer game parks tours and what we call bed and breakfasts the impression of a bed and breakfast in my youth wasnt always favourable yet in south africa it is a completely different option
6698749 those particular premises are often five star and offer you every luxury you have possibly known in 2010
6698750 its the diversity of the options which make south africa a tremendously affordable and viable competition to all the people around the world wishing to enjoy the world cup in 2010
6698751 accommodation is plentiful and of a high calibre in all the host cities
6698752 everything at our end has now been completed and we are just awaiting some signatures from the other parties involved

6698757 what i know is that i am definitely not going to be playing for thanda this season
6698758 they have already told me that i am not in the plans for this season even though they never gave me a reason why i am not in their plans since i have never been given a chance
6698759 so for now i am just waiting to hear from them about how my official exit from the club will be made i am at peace with my situation and i am fine with the prospect of leaving the club
6698760 for now i will continue going to training like i have always done because i still have a contract to respect
6698761 i just want the situation to be resolved we are in negotiations at the moment regarding my exit i am sure whatever reason why i havent played is known to the coach roger palmgren but i still believe in myself

6698767 in terms of our stadium construction programme our deadline for the confederations cup venues is december 2008 those stadiums are there and they are being upgraded in terms of stadium readiness we will be ready by the end of 2009
6698768 it is important that we succeed in this world cup because nothing less is required to open the door for the last major event on the continent the olympics
6698769 it is about nation building its about infrastructure improvement for us its about country branding its about repositioning its about improving the image of our country and its about tourism promotion
6698770 its also about return on investment job creation and legacy these are the things that not only drive not only our nation but nations of the world
6698771 the staging of the event on african soil presents us with an enormous opportunity to showcase our country and our continent i want to assure all of you present that we are on track to host one of the best and most successful world cups ever held
6698772 our overarching goal is to host an incredible event on our continent and that it will be the envy of all
6698773 we are on the right timing the right track to ensure that all goes according to plan
6698774 i wasnt told anything but i hope i will be called up for the togo game im really looking forward to playing for my country against togo and to help the team win
6698775 this event is much more than sports for us it is about our ability to host the world it is about getting out from underneath the welter of negative press coverage our continent receives
6698776 when they come they will receive a wonderfully unforgettable african experience
6698777 we are confident that global perceptions of africa will change after the world cup
6698778 from the spectacular opening ceremony to the unfailing courtesy of all the volunteers and the performances of the athletes who represented the peoples republic of china we can all agree that these olympic games are simply phenomenal

6698785 most people receive this important benefit automatically if they already receive a state pension or other social security benefit excluding housing benefit or child benefit but i am concerned that there are others perhaps those who are working who do not realise that they are eligible i would encourage them to contact the winter fuel payment helpline to check if they can claim

6698794 im not bragging im not boasting im not trying to talk myself up i do this well every day i train with the best in the world every time i race every time i line up im a contender and today i simply was not
6698795 it motivates me because i thought i deserved to be on the podium today and i did not do an effort that was worthy of even a final in my mind
6698796 at the start of the year we noticed demand was increasing
6698797 we send collectors in uniform and collectors without uniform it depends on how the debtor reacts if we need to do it to collect a debt we send a collector wearing top hat and tails so his debt attracts more attention
6698798 the way these companies approach consumers often borders on being illegal
6698799 my suggestion is that all obstetric units across this country remove t3s tylenol 3 from their obstetric formulary
6698800 ive actually contacted the hospital leadership at bc womens hospital asking that it be yanked completely so we no longer have it available
6698801 we dont want to panic people here theres kind of a warning bell going out there but we need a lot more studies to see it
6698802 the general advice is to take the smallest dose possible
6698803 the safety of patients who use our products is a priority for the company
6698804 tylenol 3 prescription tylenol with codeine is a safe and effective product when used according to the approved prescribing information
6698805 this recent revelation about codeine is of concern because codeine has always been pretty much treated rather casually
6698806 probably the best advice to people is to be very cautious about using compounds that contain codeine
6698807 in my own practice if someone needs codeine i think hard about it and make sure there is no other cause for that amount of pain
6698808 in my own clinical experience they new mothers can manage without it
6698809 desire for change on earmarks and our commitment to get it done
6698810 funding will send your tax dollars back to be used in your neighborhood where it belongs
6698811 not every earmark is bad but my goodness they ought to pass the straight face test

6698816 i tried not to make it traditional at all but to make it about dreams and fantasies and the effects of fame and how artists reinvent themselves and their lives
6698817 als brian alias danger mouse und ich uns im rahmen der arbeit am letzten gorillaz album kennen lernten haben wir schnell gemerkt dass wir etwas zusammen machen wollen nachdem die ersten tracks standen war klar dass die chemie stimmt und wir weitermachen
6698818 the new website provides a compelling case for a complete internet marketing package with up to six services we want our clients to reap the efficiency and cost savings that come from having everything under one roof and with our new all encompassing clicktelligence reporting feature the monetary value associated with these synergies no longer remains a mystery to the client
6698819 adam and the team at bold acquisitions have been a pleasure to work with so far and i know that our sessions will be a success we have mutual goals in helping our corporate trainers reach the next level of their careers and this is a great step in that direction
6698820 andrea is an inspiration to her team at 212 marketing solutions my team and myself 212 marketing has been fantastic to work with thus far and my and i couldnt be more excited about our collaboration andrea and i are committed to the development of everyone involved and strongly believe that our working together will lead to better results across the board
6698821 home based businesses collectively generate a remarkable amount of economic activity especially for women and minorities
6698822 at nrc our communitys goal is to provide at home business professionals access to the same quality of training advertising marketing and business development tools that world class companies provide their associates we focus on helping these work at home professionals achieve their business objectives
6698823 through relevant i reach a demographic that has strong faith morals and passion but disagreements politically
6698824 it wouldnt be wise for me to be seen as picking a political side when ive consistently said both sides are right in some areas and wrong in some areas
6698825 this generation of values voters doesnt necessarily need to draw political battle lines the way previous generations have and that we can work through areas of disagreement toward common goals
6698826 desire for change on earmarks and our commitment to get it done
6698827 funding will send your tax dollars back to be used in your neighborhood where it belongs
6698828 not every earmark is bad but my goodness they ought to pass the straight face test
6698829 the majority of the party thinks that asif zardari should be president
6698830 there are millions of singles looking for love online but only a handful of sites have been capable of offering video speed dating until now
6698831 online speed dating is a fantastic way for people to connect but users shouldnt have to sign up for another dating site just for this experience
6698832 randodate coms speed dating platform was designed with the both the webmaster and end user in mind
6698833 traditional online dating sites are great at helping members connect through compatibility profiles and quizzes with our free speed dating service they can continue to focus on their core services while offering their members a new and exciting way to meet face to face
6698834 savvy webmasters will understand that allowing their members to mingle outside of the traditional boundaries can actually mean a new source of traffic
6698835 each time a user begins a speed date their partner sees the site they are coming from since each session consists of up to five dates this link exposure will add up quickly
6698836 in the promotional products industry we have a common saying that every promotional pen has an average of six users in its lifetime we had the idea to demonstrate the progression of passing a pen along from one person to the next much like the pop culture game six degrees of kevin bacon this is a highly effective way to show just how many impressions one promotional pen will have
6698837 if a client has 5 000 to spend on advertising they can either buy one page advertisement in the local paper or they can buy 5 000 writing instruments unlike the newspaper ad which will only appear in one edition the pens will be passed from user to user allowing the decorated message to live on for years to come to think of the number of people who see or use just one of those pens is staggering if as consumers we look in our desks in our purses or next to our home telephones well find a pen with someone elses name on it theres no reason it cant be your name on that pen
6698838 buyplexus com is unique because it benefits both the shopper and business owner
6698839 shoppers have a place to find the products or services theyre interested in and merchants can utilize the sites marketing tools to generate additional exposure in the search engines and social media networks weve created a powerful shopping portal in buyplexus com thats capable of rivaling some of the most popular online
6698840 the free business directory promotion is designed to allow more users to experience the benefits of the network and build a significant advertiser base weve had a great response so far
6698841 since buyplexus com was built with the new web 2 0 marketing standards in mind we were able to augment the listings with additional components like business blogs rss feeds google maps photo galleries reviews comments and social media functionality
6698842 our designers and developers knew savvy marketers would appreciate these extra features and they did a great job integrating them into the site
6698843 the goal with buyplexus is to enable anyone to post and search products and services not just business owners
6698844 many competitors simply dont allow people to take advantage of a networks popularity without paying high fees or having an established business so we made sure buyplexus was accessible to everyone and didnt exclude those users
6698845 we hope the launch of buyplexus com shows our continued commitment to being a resource for everyone not just our clients
6698846 in terms of advertising a business we know the best approach to marketing is a comprehensive one so buyplexus certainly meets that need by providing so many options
6698847 we weten wat de andere atleten van bolt vinden dus we zijn alles behalve ongerust
6698848 meer respect moet tonen voor zijn tegenstanders hij zou zijn rivalen de hand moeten schudden en niet negeren
6698849 hij geeft zijn tegenstanders normaal gezien altijd een hand na afloop op de spelen niet maar usain was gewoon superblij hij heeft historisch records gebroken en twee keer goud behaald hoe zou je zelf zijn
6698850 het is echt niet zo dat bolt geen respect toont
6698851 als hij hier dagelijks keihard heeft voor getraind heeft hij zijn dansje meer dan verdiend
6698852 the launch of this new web site is a significant development in our campaign building on the brand and adding a depth of information to our advertising
6698853 recent research shows that for a growing number of ethical consumers and particularly for pork animal welfare standards are an important driver for purchase
6698854 the new web site means that our effective and simple rallying call of get some pork on that fork can be supplemented with a wealth of information about scotlands world class production standards and enable people to make an informed choice to seek out specially selected pork
6698855 the site also gives consumers the opportunity to sign up and be notified every time we release new recipes or run new campaigns and competitions its designed to be the home of all things pork on the net
6698856 we have also worked hard to improve the image of specially selected pork with scots increasingly viewing fresh pork as an easy to cook versatile and healthy meat

6698863 between now and election day not a lot of troops are going to come home
6698864 has made it clear he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq
6698865 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines
6698866 well see how he wakes up tomorrow morning but he may be doubtful for sunday
6698867 weve got to see the extent of what hes done but if there is any risk he wont play
6698868 theres no need to talk to the boys the games do get pretty heated not only against adelaide but against everyone things are going to happen but hopefully not on sunday
6698869 i dont think theres any rivalry at all i just think its been blown out of proportion this week
6698870 that final round loss was hard to swallow at the time but its a new season and as far as were concerned its all about building towards winning some silverware this year
6698871 it is actually unbelievable we talked about how he may be a chance for a medal but to come home with two and be the king of the track and field team is a whole other level
6698872 coming into the games i knew i was in good shape for the 20k and i thought i could maybe get a medal in that but the 50k obviously you have to back up from the 20
6698873 i didnt start to feel good again until yesterday and then when i was on the warm up track today i just looked up at the flame and thought this is what it is all for all those years of hard work all comes down to this so i really decided to give it a crack
6698874 i thought i would go with the leaders and see what happens im ecstatic i cant believe it
6698875 when they both got away i thought not another bronze
6698876 i was feeling good up until then and i thought something else other than bronze would be nice but i was still rapt where i was i was pretty happy when the chinese athlete dropped off and i knew i was in the medal positions again
6698877 i really feel for him because this was his chance to win the olympic gold medal
6698878 i have learned from him and he has really supported all the aussie guys i feel bad for him at the moment
6698879 he just put it in the wrong spot there was only one little hole and he found it
6698880 it was terrible one of the worst days of our lives
6698881 he was only in the shed that day because we needed to get the load out and we didnt have anyone to mind him so i had him tucked up under my arm
6698882 we were just finishing and i put him down so peter could get up higher and get the last few portatoes through and it just happened we dont let him near the shed anymore

6699006 we rely on affiliate marketing to drive our casino computer programmer volunteers sales and lead acquisition mostly because some webmasters in our field are better at marketing online than we are
6699007 things in the industry really turned a corner when people began to acquire not maintain customers online
6699008 when acquisiton via online services got big companies in the casino computer programmer volunteers sector finally woke up to the idea that the information super highway was here to stay in a very big way
6699009 when we added a website and shopping cart system our numbers went through the roof
6699010 this teamed with high positioning in the major search engines really created a whole new market for us that was never expected
6699011 with internet casino computer programmer volunteers sales booming we may have to cut back on in person sales teams
6699012 mainly because we are losing money in that operational area as we move forward well give those employees new job opportunities in our casino computer programmer volunteers company before we actually lay them off so that they can continue to grow with our company if they so desire
6699013 i prefer to take my time and read about it all online first
6699014 im not a high pressure sales type and rather just go to the store and check out sas soon as possible
6699015 i was working 9 to 5 at a marketing firm doing the typical corporate thing now however i have my own website production center and payment processing this allows me to work from home under my own rules and with unlimited income potential
6699016 after starting an internet casino computer programmer volunteers sales division in 2003 we saw our sales increase three fold
6699017 and this resulted in the creation of more jobs and employment opportunities in our company our number of employees has doubled and our number of it staff has quadrupled in a years time

6699050 there is a fundamental political development that is remarkable we have held 414 regional gubernatorial and mayoral regential elections between june 1 2005 and aug 20 2008 and this will continue
6699051 this development automatically changes the political landscape and dynamics of the country into a more democratic and accountable one
6699052 adults are not the only resourceful citizens that can contribute to development and decision making the setswana proverb reflects this when it states that botlhale jwa phala bo tswa phalaneng meaning that children also have wisdom
6699053 children parents and the community benefit in that children are better informed when they are consulted and they share their experiences and expectations limiting the risk of exploitation harm or abuse parents and guardians have a duty to guide and protect children in their development levels
6699054 it is necessary to stimulate enable and assist national governments family and civic bodies to advocate for enhanced meaningful child participation within the national context it is also necessary for all stakeholders to mainstream their policies programmes and practices to enhance meaningful child participation
6699055 for example say you have to move from town to a rural area they may not like it but if you discuss it with them and let them make contributions you might reach a compromise say leave them behind at boarding schools or rent them a house
6699056 when i want to invite a visitor home i have to tell my son first and make sure he accepts otherwise if i just bring someone and he happens not to like it he might become unruly and misbehave

6699058 the jember regent is rude he invited me to come here to see off participants of a traditional marching event but he was absent with no clear reason
6699059 i dont think that inflation will cross the 13 per cent mark we are hopeful that actual inflation will start coming down
6699060 prices of quite a number of food items have come down the international prices of maize have declined considerably
6699061 we are giving a subsidy of rs 10 per kg to below poverty line families

6699066 eight of the 18 who returned from kohima died one by one in the last 10 days
6699067 it appears to be the result of some mysterious communicable disease
6699068 the government should take it seriously because the disease may spread fast and is likely to claim more lives if preventive measures are not initiated soon the government should send a team of doctors to treat the others who are suspected to be infected

6699073 i am today able to announce that a 5 000 reward is being offered for information which leads to the arrest and conviction of those responsible
6699074 the hullabaloo began in june when the fda approved gardasil a vaccine widely described as 100 percent effective in preventing cervical cancer a disease that kills some 233 000 women worldwide each year
6699075 its worth asking a few questions why does the vaccine cost 360 for a three shot regimen how much do we know about the new product and is this a cost effective use of health care dollars
6699076 only two strains of hpv human papillomavirus that causes cervical cancer and those two account for just 70 percent of all cases the vaccine has no effect on the viral strains which account for the other 30 percent
6699077 mandatory vaccination across the u s would make an automatic blockbuster for merck at a time when the patents on some of its bestselling drugs are expiring and its desperate to replace their revenue streams
6699078 you can have hpv and not even know it says another professional actress
6699079 a growing number of parents are worried about exposing their children to the unforeseen side effects of a new vaccine to protect them from a disease that is no longer very common in the u s adding to some parents concern 82 adverse events among both teens and adult women have been reported since gardasil became available last june
6699080 more than half of all cases occurred in women who had never or rarely
6699081 wouldnt it be cheaper and safer to set up a government program that ensures that all girls and women are screened regularly while the vaccine protects against just 70 percent of all cervical cancers pap smears detect 90 to 95 percent
6699082 if we had true universal screening as in some scandinavian countries we probably wouldnt need both the vaccine and screening
6699083 118 to 120 million women in the 11 to 26 age range in the u s the eu and other high income countries
6699084 women who are vaccinated will perceive themselves to be at low risk for developing cancer and as a result will not participate in screening as recommended
6699085 now this is one cancer i dont have to worry about fighting
6699086 in two years cervical cancer has gone from obscure killer confined mostly to poor nations to the wests disease of the moment
6699087 the evidence gap drugmakers push leads to cancer vaccines rise
6699088 tens of millions of girls in the u s and europe
6699089 the lightning fast transition from newly minted vaccine to must have injection in the united states and europe represents a triumph of what the manufacturers call education and their critics call marketing
6699090 award winning advertising has promoted the vaccine before the film sex and the city some moviegoers in the united states saw ads for gardasil on youtube and in advertisements on popular shows like law and order a multi ethnic cast of young professionals urges girls to become one less statistic by getting vaccinated
6699091 some protection against infection from human papillomavirus or hpv a common and generally benign sexually transmitted virus that can in rare cases cause cancer after years of silent infection
6699092 meanwhile it is far more expensive than earlier vaccines against other diseases gardasils list price is 360 for the three dose series and the total cost is typically 400 to nearly 1 000 but with their high price the vaccines are straining national and state health budgets as well as family pocketbooks
6699093 these were the first vaccines approved for universal use in any age group that clearly cost the health system money rather than saved it
6699094 countries that pay for the vaccines will have less money available for other health needs
6699095 this kind of money could be better used to solve so many other problems in womens health
6699096 some experts are concerned about possible side effects that become apparent only after a vaccine has been more widely tested over longer periods
6699097 worry about the consequences of the rapid rollout of the new vaccines without more medical evidence they say that because of the aggressive marketing even parents of girls who are far from being sexually active may feel pressured into giving them a vaccine that is not yet needed and whose long term impact is still unclear
6699098 this big push is making people crazy thinking theyre bad moms if they dont get their kids vaccinated
6699099 and why the sudden alarm in developed countries about cervical cancer
6699100 a major killer in the developing world particularly africa where the vaccines are too expensive for use cervical cancer is classified as very rare in the west because it is almost always preventable through regular pap smears which detect precancerous cells early enough for effective treatment
6699101 merck lobbied every opinion leader womens group medical society politicians and went directly to the people it created a sense of panic that says you have to have this vaccine now said dr
6699102 i would have liked to see it go much slower
6699103 most vaccines take three years to get that sort of endorsement
6699104 in that time you learn a lot about safety and side effects and how to use it
6699105 many bills like ones passed in colorado new jersey and new york allocate more money for hpv and cervical cancer education or to promote the vaccine others like proposals in iowa and louisiana require insurers to cover it
6699106 in december 2006 merck announced it would invest 57 million to expand its elkton va plant to make gardasil helped by a 700 000 grant from a state economic development agency that is part of the executive branch two months later gov tim kaine who has been mentioned as a possible democratic vice presidential candidate signed legislation requiring gardasil for schoolgirls four months after that merck pledged to invest 193 million more in the plant to make drugs and vaccines helped by a state grant of 1 5 million
6699107 the immunity of gardasil will not last that is dangerous to assume
6699108 its very difficult to see that anybody would buy metso paper so i dont think metso paper will ever be split from metso
6699109 the units have sort of been apart and focusing on their own business
6699110 by grouping these together we believe that we can clearly maintain the focus on the forestry industry but get this growth focus on the biofuels and the waste to energy and the whole environmental sector in a different way
6699111 its still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
6699112 but it has certainly focused the market on that geopolitical threat
6699113 the russian georgia conflict has disrupted supplies and it looks like it will drag on and create a lot of uncertainty
6699114 far beyond how you now view experience and share photos
6699115 we have been abolsutely overwhlemed by demand and have turned photosynth com into a special static read only mode for the moment
6699116 weve been under incredible demand since we released just over 12 hours ago with everyone waking up around the world traffic has been on a steady ramp up since that release and has far exceeded even our most optimistic expectations
6699117 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6699118 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field
6699119 even though hes not here with us in body in his spirit we have the strength to go on
6699120 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6699121 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6699122 a significant weapon for attacking the growing pain of fuel poverty
6699123 millions of people will get a huge shock when they realise how much it will cost to heat their homes this winter for the most vulnerable people the effect will be devastating
6699124 one by one the major energy companies are lining up to clobber customers with enormous price rises
6699125 it is unacceptable that on this governments watch these companies have benefited from a 9 billion windfall yet they continue to turn the screws on people who are already struggling with high prices
6699126 i took a little weird step and i felt a little slight tweak
6699127 it was just a little awkward movement i went to get safety jarrad page and the knee just gave out
6699128 the federal prosecutor has searched offices in various locations in switzerland with the support of the federal criminal police as well as the cantons involved
6699129 spending behind the united states presidential election and around the beijing olympic games should continue to boost 2008 revenues
6699130 levels of activity in 2008 should match those seen in 2007 and there are significant new business opportunities
6699131 the prospects for 2009 remain less certain particularly if the united states and western european economies continue to be impacted by the financial crisis and commodity price increases
6699132 in addition the new united states president will have to wrestle with twin fiscal and budget deficits in early 2009 and post the olympics chinese growth may slow due to inflationary particularly food price concerns and the impact that a weakening united states
6699133 position the group very well to weather any economic slowdown
6699134 la demanda de estos servicios est aumentando porque a medida que se realizan m s descubrimientos gen ticos la gente est m s interesada en saber lo que pueden significar para ellos
6699135 miembros de la generaci n del baby boom que quieren conocer su genotipo familiar

6699138 we are working hard and hoping that early preparations will yield good results we will go out there and do our best

6699140 these jobs can be very stressful but she has a good personality
6699141 she just likes to work and she knows when its time to work
6699142 ryder went through a stage where she was very unattractive
6699143 i said to my husband oh no i think we got an ugly one but it turns out it was just an awkward stage
6699144 i want a fast paced race which will make it open and difficult for anyone
6699145 we have handled similar fields before where every player was able to finish
6699146 do you believe god is good i mean do you deep in your bones what do you really believe god is like because until we each deal with this question then nothings ever going to make any sense is it
6699147 the association also has a patron that will be unveiled soon
6699148 people had started talking but we are now playing our game they should keep quite and watch
6699149 the start was bad because some of the players were selfish and holding so much onto the ball they have now changed and are working as a team
6699150 not everything that can be counted counts and not everything that counts can be counted

6699152 i can treat impotence urinary incontinence shoulder pain stiff neck and paralysis
6699153 he simply conducts basic physiotherapy through massage and exercise and before you even know it you are okay
6699154 these are my own innovations after experience in anatomy and physiotherapy plus my training as a personal trainer in liverpool
6699155 the snp has a strong social conscience which is very scottish in itself one of the reasons scotland didnt take to lady thatcher was because of that we didnt mind the economic side so much but we didnt like the social side at all
6699156 he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to others
6699157 basically our approach is to seek to use the 2010 fifa world cup to deepen a variety of programmes that we have been assigned ourselves in the city
6699158 we also want to ensure that long after these two events are gone the legacy left behind should add to the improvement of quality of life of our people we are also confident that come 2009 joburg will be found more than ready
6699159 the aim is to create awareness of these tournaments among our communities and assess our readiness and strengthen the partnerships that we already have with fifa loc and other stakeholders
6699160 we are at advanced stage for the preparations and i am pleased that we have been meeting with various stakeholders to come up with a consolidated approach
6699161 this is a major tournament that will give us the opportunity to fine tune the readiness and test the strength of sa with regard to organising the 2010 world cup
6699162 all our planning for the next 12 months will come from the camp i think the one thing i want to make clear at the camp is we have some really tough cricket coming up before england next year we have three massive test series in the next year
6699163 nobody on our side of the family had any clue the pair were facing problems within the marriage
6699164 as far as our family is concerned they portrayed a loving couple who wanted to spend the rest of their lives together
6699165 levels of activity in 2008 should match those seen in 2007 and there are significant
6699166 the prospects for 2009 remain less certain particularly if the united states and western european economies continue to be impacted by the financial crisis and
6699167 in addition the new united states president will have to wrestle with twin fiscal and olympics chinese growth may slow due to inflationary particularly food price concerns and the impact that a weakening has on the rest of the world
6699168 position the group very well to weather any economic slowdown

6699175 ive made a major investment here to move will be at a great cost to tata motors and to shareholders
6699176 but there is a concern about our people a definite concern about not being wanted
6699177 the acccs market inquiries indicated that the proposed acquisition may raise competition concerns in relation to the global seaborne supply of iron ore lump and
6699178 to the extent the proposed acquisition lessens competition in the global seaborne supply of iron ore it would be likely to have the effect of increasing global which would in turn increase prices paid by steel makers in australia
6699179 may enable the merged firm to increase domestic prices of iron ore lump and iron ore fines by more than any increase in global iron ore prices
6699180 he just has to swallow hard and do what jfk did
6699181 we know well have to hold it down while the offense gets things figured it out
6699182 we made it work last year but its still hard
6699183 marketing gurus create new terminology like ria and web 2 0 in order to force people to engage in new conversations without them dragging along their baggage of ingrained prejudices about what something is or is not
6699184 they also do it i am convinced to make themselves seem smart
6699185 first because like all things techy its already obsolete and second because its limiting
6699186 i love it because its now such a part of the common vernacular of web culture that when its used everyone immediately understands that you are talking about something better than primitive html websites
6699187 rias are impacting the way that companies like ebay ford random house viacom ge dow jones and nbc think about the internet and desktop software and are demonstrating how innovative thinking can completely change the way they do business

6699201 the other possibilities are that the car has either been cloned or else this policeman is actually involved in the syndicate
6699202 we believe that the photographs belong to people who have been duped into buying their drivers licences from the syndicate which we suspect is operating in gauteng mpumalanga limpopo and north west province

6699216 sesungguhnya bagi mereka yang memperolehi nur adalah kerana petunjuk dari pada anak anak dan teman teman sebaliknya aku mempunyai anak anak yang tidak soleh dan tidak pernah mendoakan aku setelah mendengar jawapan mayat itu abi qalabah pun terjaga pada malam itu juga dia memanggil anak jirannya dan menceritakan apa yang dilihatnya dalam mimpi mengenai bapa mereka mendengar keadaan itu anak anak jiran itu berjanji di hadapan abi qalabah akan mendoa dan bersedekah untuk bapanya seterusnya tidak lama selepas itu abi qalabah sekali lagi bermimpi melihat jirannya bagaimanapun kali ini jirannya sudah ada nur dimukanya dan kelihatan lebih terang daripada matahari baginda rasullullah s a w berkata apabila telah sampai ajal seseorang itu maka akan masuklah satu kumpulan malaikat ke dalam lubang lubang kecil dalam badan dan kemudian mereka menarik rohnya melalui kedua dua telapak kakinya sehingga sampai ke lutut setelah itu datang pula sekumpulan malaikat yang lain masuk menarik roh dari lutut hingga sampai ke perut dan kemudiannya mereka keluar datang lagi satu kumpulan malaikat yang lain masuk dan menarik rohnya dari perut hingga sampai ke dada dan kemudiannya mereka keluar dan akhir sekali datang lagi satu kumpulan malaikat masuk dan menarik roh dari dadanya hingga sampai ke kerongkong dan itulah yang dikatakan saat nazak orang itu
6699217 kalau orang yang nazak itu orang yang beriman maka malaikat jibril a
6699218 kalau orang yang nazak itu orang munafik maka jibril a

6699379 our goodwill to keep turkeys eu path open is not without limit
6699380 if we see that turkey is not being positive or constructive in its stance at a time when a new phase in finding a cyprus solution has begun then we should reconsider our general policy towards turkeys eu accession
6699381 above all lets not forget that turkeys european prospects depend on cypruss consent because from time to time this is forgotten especially by our european partners
6699382 from 2004 cyprus has continually accepted turkeys accession course but weve seen absolutely no goodwill gesture from the turkish side either towards the cyprus republic or its eu obligations towards cyprus

6699400 i hope hes not going to be out for that long wed like to get him back where he can help us not just to come back but to help us win i know he can help us with defence but were looking for him to help us with his bat too
6699401 obviously we didnt want to give away a player that we have more control of and get somebody back that we only had a year of

6699415 its a bright spot for me personally because i felt so bad last year in the scrimmage in fall camp when he got hurt
6699416 thats one of those decisions you question as a head coach why i even had him in there that he went home just once this summer and only for a few days for his brothers high school graduation mostly he trained and rehabilitated and went to class day after day
6699417 they tried to teach me what to do to stay at byu but really it had to come from within

6699419 i feel close to the top of my game right now
6699420 he is a very good player but he hadnt demonstrated a lot of maturity
6699421 so to see what hes had to do and how hes grown it very special he wouldnt probably view it like this but to me its been kind of a defining moment in the kids life in terms of diligence perseverance and maybe maturity that hes demonstrated
6699422 i talked to him on the phone last friday and he didnt tell me he was sick or anything
6699423 he was a fantastic leader who didnt back down to anybody players owners or reporters
6699424 i saw him in discussions with owners where he was super tough and didnt back down as a player you had to respect that
6699425 had the clarity of vision to understand that the true best interests of players was not in strikes and picket lines but in partnership with the boardrooms of wealthy owners

6699430 we just kept on going and going and he halladay just did what he does all the time
6699431 i just didnt have it its a hell of a time not to have it
6699432 i was like a spectator its the worst 1 000 ive put together in years probably six years im sorry im really sorry
6699433 ive based a whole career on surprising myself and surprising the people around me and seemingly ive done it again
6699434 it motivates me because i thought i deserved to be on the podium today and i did not do an effort that was worthy of even a final in my mind
6699435 its all on me im not blaming anybody or anything except for what i did wrong which i cant really put a finger on
6699436 you dear doctor are the sinner but i am the one in hell
6699437 deer ticks are the carriers of lyme disease but ticks also spread other diseases and according to pennsylvania game commission wildlife veterinarian walt cottrell most blacklegged ticks become infected with lyme disease from biting white footed mice rather than deer
6699438 lyme disease is only spread by the blacklegged tick and people cant get lyme disease from game animals or game birds cottrell said
6699439 the blacklegged tick is small roughly the size of a sesame seed and extremely difficult to see especially when on a dog
6699440 ticks feed three times during their life the nymphal stage feeds during the spring and summer the larval stage during the fall and winter and the second year the adult tick also feeds during the fall
6699441 dogs symptoms are whimpering becoming lethargic fevers swollen joints trouble getting up and not eating mattera said
6699442 sometimes the changes are so subtle theyre easily attributed to the dog getting older or that its hot outside
6699443 vets have a new test to determine if dogs have lyme called an elisa test that will show either positive or negative mattera said
6699444 its a color test almost like a pregnancy test with blood put on the stick and if blue dot appears its positive for lyme
6699445 once a dog tests positive on the elisa test it will always show positive so we recommend a c 6 antibody test because this blood test puts a number on the lyme disease
6699446 if it has then we just retreat it and dogs should be tested every two years if they live where ticks are active and every year if they tested positive testing is the only way to protect your dog from the disease and if not treated it can be fatal
6699447 i knew it was a risk having a second child but i wanted my son to have a sibling
6699448 ironically the very thing that gives my wife mobility takes away her access
6699449 a day doesnt go by where there isnt an incident i feel like its important to speak up i know in the past i would have tried to ignore it and not say anything thats probably the case for a lot of people
6699450 if you back away nothing gets done so its important to follow through
6699451 we went out there and knew we had to have a good race due to the points spread we achieved that
6699452 i knew after my last dive that my ranking was first i was a little surprised
6699453 but i knew the chinese have really good last dives that she does a 10 most of the time her last dive is really amazing and she never misses it i knew it was really close and i wasnt expecting me to stay in first
6699454 ive been through a really rough time in my life and it made me the person i am today and it made me dive like this
6699455 were with her every day for years and years and shes still an enigma to us
6699456 we dont really know what sort of makes her really smile shes so unique and such an individual and we just try to go along for the ride as best we can
6699457 she looked kind of unflappable the whole time shes been here and she came in with a real mission in mind
6699458 that was the dive that dropped her out of medals in 2000
6699459 and probably the dive for 2004 although she was still in contending position and missed the last dive thats the one she tends to miss the most and the most often so we were really on pins and needles there
6699460 it was pretty hard but i was still young and i knew there was another opportunity for me to do good in diving

6699468 conservatives need to find a better way to spend their time
6699469 i can think of at least two things wrong with that title
6699470 the adoption of appropriate information behaviour to identify through whatever channel or medium information well fitted to information needs leading to wise and ethical use of information in society
6699471 nous sommes parfaitement conscients que la russie est une grande puissance le probl me est que son retour en force sur la sc ne internationale ne garantit nullement quelle aura un r le constructif dans lavenir au proche orient
6699472 il est difficile de croire en la bonne foi de la russie quand il sav re malgr toutes les d n gations de moscou que des armes russes vendues la syrie sont parvenues au mouvement chiite libanais hezbollah

6699481 i started with cuttings and then those got bigger and i cut them then i had two then four then eight
6699482 i asked the kids if they would like to learn how to do some planting
6699483 very informally the superintendent let us use the big rec room and we started potting plants
6699484 i am so happy with the reception from the children and it is still a work in progress
6699485 you can come here all right just dont expect us to get all excited about it
6699486 once he got serious in high school and what not about the running you know that this is something that he really wanted to do
6699487 he says bring it on hes ready for this this is what hes been training for all his life
6699488 hes always had a competitive spirit in him from when i used to lift weights and stuff he used to always come up to me show his biceps and try to challenge
6699489 you know the dedication and integrity he got it from us now kay
6699490 this is something that he really wanted to do to put the effort and his hard work and everything i think he found his nitch
6699491 we are thrilled that the first ever global game board includes an interesting mix of cities that showcases the dynamic cultures sights and history of the planet
6699492 we have a little island in front a beautiful sandy beach and nice cottages

6699497 when i was little 7 8 9 and 10 my uncle took me up fishing all the time
6699498 part of the irony of running the lodge is that i dont have time to fish
6699499 its a lot harder than you might imagine its fun work but you are always on call
6699500 we jumped in with both feet it was insane i was in tears
6699501 i work 14 hours a day seven days a week and it is almost exclusively physical work
6699502 at first we thought it sounded kind of religious but this camp has been here since 1936 and no way can we change the name
6699503 you get to know little things about people over the years theyll become friends
6699504 it was breathtaking it wasnt a hard decision to make
6699505 id always thought what would it be like to run a lodge
6699506 were having a great year i have no regrets whatsoever
6699507 you are up north in the fresh air meeting people i dont like going south any more
6699508 it would be very sad for this committee to prescribe what should be written in papers and said on radio

6699510 the fact that google is putting their muscle behind these knols cant be underestimated the online marketing community is bracing itself for what is certain to be a new flood of social networkers headed to this site but its not common knowledge yet much like facebook and myspace these programs take a while to get into consumer vernacular when they do there will be an explosion of marketing but its not enough to just put up a knol promoters have to be smart about it thats why ive researched and crafted these programs offering them exclusively to ame and our authors
6699511 we were the first to use social networking sites to promote our authors and the first to use book trailers and micro blogging in fact we were promoting online before it was the in thing to do were pleased to once again be ahead of the internet marketing game with this new program
6699512 i think it would be good for both of us so tell holt renfrew i said hello and id love to talk to them

6699517 maria pinto or jeans how else do i know if my clothes work this dress its a silk crepe print easy and comfortable its from a couple of seasons ago
6699518 feminine but still strong someone said they were timeless with an edge i like that
6699519 theyve always from the beginning been about unusual materials and beading and embellishments i source fabric from all over the world beautiful materials with a super flattering very subtle cut and fit
6699520 the fall collection is understated elegance lots of texture and a lot of separate items so you can buy one or you can buy 15 and move them around but just one item can add a lot to your season
6699521 a dream to dress elegant and statuesque weve had a lot of requests for the clothes she wears from here
6699522 the purple dress is something pretty much anyone can wear you dont have to have her height but i tell women dont follow a trend
6699523 i could sell anyone anything but if its not right its going to bounce back on me i believe in energy fields i was never all out just to make a sale thats not my philosophy of life
6699524 but i didnt say id lose the sale id just steer them into buying something that was appropriate
6699525 by a friend while we were having dinner she said i know someone whod really like your stuff can she come and see you that was while her husband was running for the senate so they didnt have much of a profile
6699526 the character of the investigation especially the territory of the activities indicates that the effects of this agreement may cover the entire european union

6699529 s a vorbit destul de mult si despre probleme pe care le a avut pana acum iphone s a vorbit deoarece este un element interesant in evolutia tehnologiei si telefoniei atat timp cat producatorul rezolva problemele aparute pe moment clientului eu ca simplu consumator de tehnologie sunt multumit important este sa nu am timpi morti foarte mari si in acelasi timp important sa vad din partea producatorului implicare daca el e receptiv la probleme este normal ca un produs nou aflat la prima versiune sa vina si cu ceva probleme care au scapat echipelor de testare urmatoarele versiuni ar trebui sa fie mai stabile si sa elimine bug urile i cu siguranta asa va fi
6699530 there is a ton of work that needs to be done but were sorting through that
6699531 this will be a tremendous asset to the members of the bar to our lawmakers and to the general public
6699532 this event pertains to the west seattle campus only and is not an all campus event like two boys buried by ice rescued
6699533 students who are planning to attend their community college under this program and are over the 100 000 mark will have to find another way to pay for school if theres even another way
6699534 i think to pull the plug or change this program now with parents needing to make this decision is just simply unfair and i would hope that the governor will announce that as soon as possible
6699535 hopefully in a state budget approaching 34 billion we can find 2 5 million to keep this program going
6699536 he is willing to entertain those proposals with the understanding that it will require trading one cut for another
6699537 this remains a lean budget which means doing more with less and in some instances doing less
6699538 the growth is far outpacing the funding for this program

6699549 he ratan tata has invested a lot in this project it is not his intention to pull out until he is forced to do so by the circumstances he has said earlier that it is the people of west bengal who have to take the call
6699550 we are deeply concerned about the people of bengal its for the people of bengal to decide whether we are going to be an unwanted citizen or a resposible corporate if it is the latter then we will be happy if not then we would have to just pursue our plans regardless
6699551 if people say that that we will protect our investments irrepsective of anything then they are wrong i will not bring in my employees to singur if there is threat of them being beaten up tata will do whatever necessary to protect its employees
6699552 i want to understand why the tata group is unwanted in west bengal there is a definite concern of not being where were wanted and where people are suspicious of us if there is this feeling among the people then we will exit the state
6699553 we have plans to launch nano by october this year but many people dont want that to happen and its very easy for them to prevent it from happening but i have made a major investement here to move from here will be at a great cost not only for the tata group but also for west bengal

6699572 this bird is more threatened than the tiger and very few people have ever seen it people thought jerdons courser was a block to progress but are now benefitting from the canals realignment because they will receive generous compensation and the only land they are losing is difficult to farm
6699573 there is every chance that jerdons courser will survive this development and with the right management eventually increase its numbers
6699574 the decision is an example of how governments communities and conservationists can work together for mutual gain without putting in jeopardy the future of a threatened species
6699575 it is crucial we find other sites hosting jerdons coursers and encourage both politicians and the people living nearby to support that work
6699576 we are hoping the courser will become the state bird of andhra pradesh to create a sense of pride and stewardship among all of those on whom its future depends

6699631 we see the adoption of the fla by kde as a positive and important milestone in the maturity of the free software community
6699632 the fla was designed to help projects increase the legal maintainability of their software to ensure long term protection and reliability kde is among the most important free software initiatives and it is playing a central role in bringing freedom to the desktop this decision of the kde project underlines its dedication to think about how to make that freedom last
6699633 kde e v has endorsed the use of a particular fla based directly on the fsfes sample fla as the preferred way to assign copyright to the association we recognise that assignment is an option that individuals may wish to exercise it is in no way pushed upon kde contributors there are also other avenues of copyright assignment available besides the fla but we believe this is the easiest way to get it done with little fuss enthusiasm for the fla was immediate people were asking for printed versions of the form before the week was out so that they could fill one in
6699634 the fla is a versatile document designed to work across different countries with different perceptions of copyright and authorship
6699635 as a truly international project kde provides a great example of how the fla can provide legal coherency in the mid to long term its been a pleasure to help with the adoption process and fsfes freedom task force is ready to continuing supporting kde in the future

6699694 ariel merari a tel aviv university psychologist has profiled 50 suicide bombers and found that there were hardly any common factors none were deranged or schizophrenic few had problems like depression merari concluded that the only factor linking all forms of suicide terrorism was the way bombers were recruited and trained it is the psychology of the group not the individual that is key
6699695 there are serious flaws in the nss and the approach it embodies but it is a document which offers all things to all readers while being strangely unable to provide much in the way of vision leadership and motivation or strategy in other words the nss refers to the uks core values human rights the rule of law legitimate and accountable government justice freedom tolerance and opportunity for all but these values are mentioned in a strangely passive and defensive way almost as if the most that should be done with these immense ideas is to protect them from marauding terrorists and criminals and of course to stop them being ruined by flood water saddest of all these values appear to constitute little more than the normality to which we are told the governments security strategy will enable us to return as soon as possible after some harm occurs

6699701 i hope that all committee members will be able to support the civic reception and that t hose who feel they are unable to vote for will at least not vote against the worst thing for the city will be if this issue becomes a political football with the resulting bad feeling that will be generated
6699702 the milieu of terrorists is invariably morally squalid when it is not merely criminal
6699703 the data show that there is little connection between suicide terrorism and islamic fundamentalism or any religion for that matter in fact the leading instigator of suicide attacks is the tamil tigers in sri lanka a marxist leninist group whose members are from hindu families but who are adamantly opposed to religion they have have committed 75 of the 188 incidents
6699704 liberal democracies may be able to resist muslim terrorism but the greatest long running threat to secularism democracy and science could come from within from the emerging coalition of the religious right and the romantic left brought together by a loathing for open society that they share with each other and with osama bin laden

6699706 we have discovered that state attempts to guarantee fairness through monopoly provision by monolithic public services turns out to be as unfair as previous ideas of 98 tax rates and forced equality of outcome so if monopoly state provision is not the answer what is evidence from around the world shows that just as a broad consensus now exists that we should be free to make our own choices and to innovate in the private sphere so we must trust choice competition in provision and local decision making in public services
6699707 sooner or later there will be a murder of a police officer unless the police are able to deploy ruthlessness in tracking down and wiping out these dissident members
6699708 i believe the community will accept such measures and if dissidents are shot on sight the community will accept that it is a necessary use of lethal force to prevent dissident republicanism from growing
6699709 finally given the seriousness of this most recent murder attempt i believe the stormont executive ought to ensure that a full discussion on the security situation must take place with a view to ensuring every encouragement is given to the police and army in the eradication of dissident republicans

6699859 feeling the pain is a necessary step in the healing process precisely because its a natural reaction that the patient failed to go through which resulted in all sorts of defense mechanism healing comes only after the inner self says it had enough of the pain after the denial phase one is on the track track if one is going through or as the counselor says feeling the pain of course this doesnt meant giving in to the temptation to be hysterical about it its important that the pain is managed while it is being expressed whats equally important to avoid is short circuiting the process there are no shortcuts to healing short cuts are a result of denial which only leads to more denial more projection and more complex defense mechanisms

6699863 well this one is by design discovery was one of the sections i wanted to work on this year and im really proud of how its turned out i wanted discovery to be the place that people go to discover new talent at our festival where we show what we consider to be some of the most exciting new voices in cinema from all over the world to do that i took off some of the restrictions we had on the program in the past in terms of the premiere status and distribution status we had quite a number of limitations on what was eligible for our discovery section in the past thats changed and as a result i think this is really just a great showcase for new talent in the movies

6699876 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6699877 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6699878 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6699879 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6699880 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6699881 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6699882 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6699883 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6699884 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6699885 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6699886 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6699887 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6699888 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6699889 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6699890 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6699891 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6699892 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6699893 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6699894 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6699895 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6699896 im so cool and inside joke and pw cliquey that if you arent one of the cool kids you probably arent hip enough to get my obscure outside the box unique above all you mortals humor and blogging mastery and if you dont agree its just because you arent as sophisticated as us kool kids
6699897 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6699898 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

6699901 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6699902 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6699903 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6699904 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6699905 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6699906 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6699907 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6699908 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6699909 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6699910 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6699911 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6699912 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6699913 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6699914 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6699915 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6699916 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6699917 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6699918 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6699919 it hurts im upset i came here to achieve a lot more and i just fell short
6699920 i cant believe im standing here with an olympic silver medal and im really pissed
6699921 it the silver is not what i wanted but ill take it
6699922 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6699923 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6699924 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6699925 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6699926 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6699927 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6699928 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6699929 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6699930 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6699931 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6699932 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6699933 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6699934 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6699935 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

6699937 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6699938 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6699939 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6699940 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6699941 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6699942 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6699943 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6699944 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6699945 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6699946 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6699947 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6699948 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6699949 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6699950 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

6699958 i really do believe that promoting brown fat growth is a plausible approach to weight control
6699959 to me it is attractive because of its simplicity if more of our fat were brown fat the mouse studies suggest that we would be leaner and better able to resist obesity
6699960 we showed that brown fat and white fat have completely different origins
6699961 brown fat is derived from muscle that was a huge surprise
6699962 the hope is that this research will lead to better ways to treat obesity especially for people who are overweight because of their genes
6699963 right now there are not many good options for these people
6699964 answers to these questions would take us a step closer to the ultimate goal of promoting the brown fat lineage as a potential way of counteracting obesity
6699965 we know that we can stimulate the production of brown fat in mice
6699966 it is not unreasonable to think that we can also do this in humans
6699967 marketing gurus create new terminology like ria and web 2 0 in order to force people to engage in new conversations without them dragging along their baggage of ingrained prejudices about what something is or is not
6699968 they also do it i am convinced to make themselves seem smart
6699969 first because like all things techy its already obsolete and second because its limiting
6699970 i love it because its now such a part of the common vernacular of web culture that when its used everyone immediately understands that you are talking about something better than primitive html websites
6699971 rias are impacting the way that companies like ebay ford random house viacom ge dow jones and nbc think about the internet and desktop software and are demonstrating how innovative thinking can completely change the way they do business
