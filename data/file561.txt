5610000 it was a little surprising at first when he called but we had a great conversation and im thrilled about the event
5610001 im going to talk about the broad stroke of evangelical christianity one thing i will say is that theres no way to pigeonhole evangelical christians theres a perception of evangelical churches as being political but that is not the case
5610002 we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the trans atlantic structures
5610003 to clearly indicate that we are not accepting a new line
5610004 is a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5610005 this is not something that is just cost free nobody needs russian strategic aviation along americas coast
5610006 the continuation of the awakening councils as they are now is unacceptable
5610007 we fought the americans for four years and we fought al qaida too
5610008 we are an experienced armed group we are fully capable of bringing the house down
5610009 someone answered for this in terms of the death penalty
5610010 for all the fault he does bear for keerans untimely death wood does not deserve to die
5610011 he has never taken a human life by his own hands
5610012 squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent obama issued a sharp retort questioning mccains sincerity in support of bush administrations goals in the war mccain heavily promoted in the months after the sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our from their country
5610013 we got plenty of ball left we got some guys out right now and were looking forward to getting them back whenever that said youve got to play with who youve got out there weve got to learn to play with whoever we got and keep it rolling
5610014 we pretty much stayed in our basic defense and that probably hasnt made it overly difficult for the other teams offense to figure out where we are and what were doing
5610015 were not really trying to fool anybody were just trying to play good fundamental football we can play better fundamental football
5610016 its a very fine line because you can get into a groove of bad habits and when bad habits get to rolling theyre like good habits they can continue on if you dont pay attention to them
5610017 what we need to do is really focus back on the details thats what allows us to win ballgames in the preseason and throughout the season thats how we function as a team by paying attention to the details
5610018 you saw what happened sunday night when we dont pay attention to details missed tackles missed assignments guys not getting off of blocks special teams offense i cant speak for them but im pretty sure they werent paying attention to the details either thats what we have to get back to the basics
5610019 its a short week where were coming off a long week of preparing for tampa bay and basically kind of going into the tank to now coming into this short week where the third game is considered the game plan game or whatever we really need to get on the ball for this short week and have a great game on friday
5610020 the younger kids are focusing more on their planning and problem solving while they are actually playing the game while adolescents are focusing less on their planning and strategizing and more on the here and now
5610021 the single best predictor of their skills is how much they had played video games in the past and how much they played now those were better predictors of surgical skills than years of training and number of surgeries performed
5610022 so the first question you might ask your surgeon is how many of these surgeries have you done
5610023 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5610024 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5610025 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5610026 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5610027 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5610028 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square senator obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq
5610029 first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5610030 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5610031 it is hard to understand how senator mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5610032 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5610033 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent senator obama
5610034 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5610035 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5610036 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5610037 is the highest of arts in the sense that it imposes forms not on matter as do the other arts but on minds
5610038 that it is almost impossible to provide an adequate substitute
5610039 we have agreed a fee with newcastle for shola and he spent time at the club having a medical
5610040 things are moving on hopefully we can get it all tied up
5610041 for a long while as they ranted about democracy iraqi politicians were also laughing to themselves and they have been backed up by the greatest laughers of them all the americans and the might of the u s army in fact since the americans created the racist sectarian governing council on the first day of their occupation everyone has been laughing to themselves over the democracy that iraqis have been practicing
5610042 now all of iraq must show the courage necessary to stop this democracy game that has been exposed and for which we iraqis have paid so heavily with our priceless blood the question is whats the solution whats the alternative to the false democracy with which all iraqis comfort themselves today for if the new iraq is to rise up iraqis must take hold of the only choice real democracy which doesnt submit to racial or sectarian influence regardless of which side it comes from
5610043 fine when you go we wont transfer you well put you in as you quit and if the other branch calls for a reference ill give you a bad review and tell them you never came in on time and called out all the time
5610044 le bairro alto quand vous verrez les tags vous serez arriv s
5610045 quartier le plus visit de lisbonne le bairro devient une immense exposition un espace privil gi de culture et contre culture qui souligne le travail de dizaines dartistes diff rents qui voient ainsi leur norme talent valoris
5610046 quand on parle de street art on imagine la nuisance visuelle des tags qui recouvrent parfois des murs entiers du bairro le mal veut faire exactement le contraire mettre en avant les oeuvres lartiste qui est derri re certaines pi ces dune immense valeur parfois associ es de la pollution visuelle
5610047 et toutes les nuits vers 04h00 05h00 ils arrivent et commencent gribouiller les murs
5610048 moi je continue repeindre par dessus parce que sils sont t tus moi aussi
5610049 ca ne servira rien et dailleurs ce nest pas la premi re fois que la mairie fait cette promesse mais ils nont jamais rien nettoy
5610050 taguer de temps en temps mais en dehors des quartiers r sidentiels
5610051 the damages and costs ordered by the court are significant and should act as a deterrent
5610052 taking direct steps against infringers is an important and effective weapon in the battle against online piracy
5610053 an open court process with a full report is certainly preferable to justice of the type being mooted by the government on p2p where activity takes place behind closed doors through industry action

5610057 sir you ignored us the other day at the bus stop
5610058 yeah but after you got on your bus you just ignored us we were banging on the windows and yelling your name but you just had your hood up and ignored us
5610059 well that wasnt intentional i have no peripheral vision in that hood and when i heard yelling and banging i probably just assumed it was a couple of trouble making hoodrats and as it turns out i was right
5610060 one of the most reliable sources of scathing rebuttal to the left wing media has become known for its humorous but biting style his regular verbal assault on labour ministers has quite a reputation
5610061 we like mr eugenides we highly recommend adding him to your blogroll go and read it is absolutely the most glorious stuff
5610062 oh boy i think reading you and devils kitchen is going to damage my psyche what a joy
5610063 the most amusing non stop critique of the labour government available
5610064 my favorite anglo rage boy the best apoplectic brit blogger
5610065 a widely acknowledged political genius of the first order still he finds time to visit greece sink a pint or two and take on the idiots who purport to govern our fair land
5610066 there really is no purpose to be served by following humbly in the wake of the genius of mr eugenides why seek to improve on perfection when one knows in advance that one will fail
5610067 i am impressed with the dexterity of mr e linguistic and otherwise
5610068 i rather enjoyed the retort of the blogger known as mr eugenides
5610069 this is the first violent death of a wfp staff member in somalia since 1993 although five drivers employed by wfp contractors have been killed since the start of the year
5610070 writers critics and the general public react spontaneously to an unusual set of provocative forms with concepts phrases and similes they already know
5610071 a successful iconic building will always elicit a flurry of bizarre comparisons a veritable blizzard of idiotic similes an absolute snowstorm of ridiculous conceit
5610072 the successful landmark has to be both enigmatic and expressive it must suggest much more than it names and leave the final interpretation if it ever comes

5610077 the only forces that are permitted to remain under the cease fire agreement are the forces that were in there at the aug 6 time frame
5610078 anything such as that or any other military equipment that was moved in would be in violation of this cease fire and should be removed immediately
5610079 returning us to the dark ages and making the guys that live in this town seem like sex hungry starved men that will pounce upon the first girl that they see walking down the street
5610080 oh its going to be so hard to say goodbye i love you all too
5610081 toto were home home and this is my room and youre all here and im never leaving here ever ever again because i love you all
5610082 no 1 we need a way for people to keep making a living here
5610083 people are interested in our island way of life and theyre willing to pay for having these experiences
5610084 what weve seen is that baby boom age tourists want something experiential
5610085 they want something authentic they want to meet folks eat what they eat hear how they talk learn how they live
5610086 there was no way we were going to miss out again
5610087 this place is culture shock like going back in time and who could turn down the cakes
5610088 ive wondered for years whether mine would be the last generation really living and growing up here
5610089 the good news is we the island have four children living here now and one on the way
5610090 i have been getting some kayakers wholl come over and go camping overnight
5610091 the kayakers are different tourists they want to get out there not just walk and have a good island meal
5610092 sean has done the best job of running our entire offense and doing everything that we need to do with our offense
5610093 he has a little more huddle command right now and thats simply because hes older and has more experience diondre is making great strides and sean knows that diondre is a person we trust to put into the ball game you have to start somewhere and you have to start someone for that first series we feel we have two guys we can use
5610094 sean setzer will be our quarterback for the unlv game but we anticipate diondre will be in the game for a significant amount of time because of his running ability
5610095 we are 12 days out now and its time to start getting a little more serious about things and start honing in
5610096 we all know the opportunity we have and we definitely have to get it done so whatever we need to do we need to do time is running out
5610097 were not where we need to be 12 days out we certainly have to make a lot of progress in 12 days
5610098 we have to go out and execute our offense that is the bottom line
5610099 a lot of times the o line gets most of it but a lot of time its the quarterback not getting the ball out of his hands in time or the receivers not running the right depth its attention to detail once again
5610100 i dont know who they are afraid of i dont know with whom theyre angry i do know what they said was totally and completely not believable
5610101 do you know you can get locked up for lying in court
5610102 kids are going to drink whether its legal or illegal
5610103 wed at least be able to have a more open dialogue with students about drinking as opposed to this sham where people dont want to talk about it because its a violation of the law
5610104 how many times must we relearn the lessons of prohibition
5610105 adults under 21 are deemed capable of voting signing contracts serving on juries and enlisting in the military but are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5610106 we have this law that in effect prevents any state from exploring new ways of addressing the issue
5610107 we have a crisis on our hands we need some new ideas and new thinking
5610108 drunk driving used to be a part of american culture until someone stood up and said we need to make a change and 25 years later designated driver is a commonplace term in every household in america
5610109 it gives me great pause to think of sending thousands of students onto a campus where the person who is most accountable doesnt seem to be devoted to ensuring their health and safety
5610110 if they drink too much in the beginning of an evening they can get alcohol poisoning
5610111 theyre really not aware of how their judgment is impaired we hope they dont get into a car or if theyre a young woman go to a fraternity party its just not healthy
5610112 a lot of young people feel that they are afraid of enforcement
5610113 they tend to get in a car and go someplace else and thats very very dangerous i worry about it every weekend
5610114 i think alcohol is seen a lot of times as a forbidden thing and people want it
5610115 its almost like contraband once you get it you have to drink all of it
5610116 maybe im being idealistic but in europe you can drink once you can see the bar
5610117 i think we should maybe take a lesson from what other countries are doing
5610118 lets debate the age and look at the pros and cons
5610119 i really think weve got to somehow be able to control it better because what we have done now is driven it underground and we cant do anything about it
5610120 there are a lot of things we could do if it wasnt underground
5610121 residents of other more affluent jurisdictions who do not have a stake in our community
5610122 two separate yet equally important groups the police who investigate crime and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders
5610123 i noticed it when i was walking to get the bus and i tripped over it
5610124 when the bus pulls in a lot of times it would stop right in front of where those bolts were
5610125 i never saw anybody fall but i certainly saw a lot of people trip i did it myself
5610126 the commissioner used the tools at his disposal to make the neighborhood safe

5610128 in den vergangenen 20 monaten konnten wir viele erfahrungen in der zusammenarbeit mit allen beteiligten sammeln jetzt wollen wir uns selbstkritisch hinterfragen und den blick weiter nach vorne richten

5610133 dar ber hinaus werden im rahmen einer f hrung durch das dhl innovation center rfid einsatzm glichkeiten pr sentiert
5610134 its troubling and we think a serious look needs to be taken
5610135 it goes to great pains to list all the things its going to fund that they obviously know voters will support but it doesnt talk about the half billion dollars going to the gambling industry or horse racing
5610136 when you make a gambling lobbyist secretary of state you get language that is favorable to the gambling industry
5610137 passage of the referendum will help us meet the many unmet needs of our students
5610138 in dem vorliegenden fall einer adress cd mit 17 000 kundendaten handelt es sich nicht um ein ph nomen der call center branche sondern augenscheinlich um kriminelles handeln dieser umgang mit personenbezogenen daten ist mit den ethischen grunds tzen des call center forum deutschland nicht vereinbar
5610139 dass in der diskussion jetzt call center und kriminelle in einen topf geworfen werden ist zwar bequem entspricht allerdings nicht der wirklichkeit in deutschland

5610151 whoever heard of moshiach with a brim thats turned down
5610152 if this is the rule ill turn my brim up before i go to the next shul
5610153 if you want to be moshiach you must be properly outfitted
5610154 no difference to me what i wear on my head
5610155 youre the moshiach just imagine that whoever heard of moshiach without a black hat
5610156 if you want to be moshiach and be accepted in this town put some pinches in your hat and turn that brim down
5610157 i guess my time hasnt come ill just have to return to where i came from
5610158 yes its very wonderful that you all learn torah but you seem to have forgotten a crucial part of our mesorah
5610159 the first place to start is to shut up your mouths and open up your hearts

5610163 rafa ha realizado un gran juego para conseguir ser n mero uno es lo que yo he esperado desde que alcanc la cima que si alguien me superaba lo hiciera porque ha jugado un tenis excelente ganado los mejores torneos y dominado el circuito por eso creo que sin ninguna duda rafa se lo merece
5610164 nadal es un jugador enorme con un carisma y un esp ritu de lucha incre bles que merece ser el n mero uno del mundo sobre todo tras ganar una de las m s grandes finales de wimbledon de la historia poco despu s de conquistar roland garros
5610165 creo que alcanzar el n mero uno del mundo supone la mayor gloria para un atleta nadal lo merece desde hace tiempo federer le ha ayudado a ser un jugador mejor y creo que posee la capacidad de mantenerse en esa posici n durante mucho tiempo
5610166 nadal realiz un torneo de wimbledon espectacular derrotando a federer en cinco sets es un n mero uno digno la consistencia de federer durante tres a os ha sido uno de los grandes logros en la historia del tenis y ahora espero que nadal siga ganando en 2008 el us open supondr un duro examen para ambos
5610167 esto demuestra que federer es humano tras firmar cuatro a os que se ubican entre los m s grandes en la historia del tenis nadal ha mejorado mucho durante el timo curso sobre todo en superficies distintas de la tierra batida se lo merece
5610168 rafa ha estado muy cerca desde hace tres a os pero hasta hoy el tenis de federer era de otro planeta hoy se muestra m s humano y rafa sigue mejorando no puedo decir que yo le he ayudado mucho a lo mejor un poco cuando yo ten a 24 a os hoy suma 32 y practicaba con l me motivaba nunca te gusta perder contra un ni o l tambi n me ayud a ser un tenista m s completo por la intensidad de su entrenamiento y su deseo de triunfar l me preguntaba cosas y yo le respond a no s si significa algo pero de los tres n meros uno que hemos tenido en espa a dos son de mallorca

5610170 uns geht es um die von beiden institutionen erfolgreich gelehrte innovationsmethode des design thinking durch gemeinsame wissenschaftliche forschungsprojekte wollen wir herausfinden welche faktoren diese art des ingenieurartigen und kreativen entwickelns von innovationen f r alle lebensbereiche letztlich so erfolgreich machen
5610171 ingenieure sind stets bestrebt die grundlegenden ergebnisse wissenschaftlicher forschung so anzuwenden wie es den bed rfnissen der menschen entspricht wenn wir diesen innovationsprozess k nftig besser verstehen hilft uns das der gesellschaft in k rzerer zeit bessere l sungen bereitzustellen
5610172 zusammen mit den kollegen der stanford university werden wir auch untersuchen wie solche von kleinen multidisziplin ren teams hervorgebrachten innovationsprozesse k nftig weiter verbessert und fortentwickelt werden k nnten
5610173 es ist an der zeit durch streng wissenschaftliche forschung herauszufinden wann und warum es der design thinking methode gelingt schneller zu innovationen zu kommen die den menschen nutzen wir werden uns daran machen die n chste generation dieser methode und weiterer unterst tzender techniken zu entwickeln und sind froh dass uns professor hasso plattner in diesem bem hen unterst tzt

5610179 i would love to see more latinas i think they are coming weve got to be patient but soon they will be here
5610180 nick if youre watching im a size 36 waist and an extra large shirt thank you
5610181 i know im swedish but i really do feel american to be honest with you
5610182 but my heritage is european and i would love to play on nicks team and i know all the european guys on the team
5610183 i used to play the european tour i might be a little bit different but im going to be playing hard for europe if i make the team
5610184 some of my friends told me its a totally different course than no 4 and they said its pretty hard around the greens
5610185 all youve got to do is try to hit it on the center of the green im pretty good at that
5610186 i was hitting it so far offline that i had some good lies in the pine straw and on the packed down cart paths you name it i was on it i got it up and down from everywhere
5610187 i struggled on the back nine i got a little bit stressed after the two bogeys but i started pretty well
5610188 for me it has been difficult to get that second title its been a long wait

5610196 suni you are not flying a plane its a two wheeler dear keep it on the road
5610197 here keep some petrol coupons with you you will need them now
5610198 its alright dear i have quite many remaining with me still
5610199 oh amit wish i could tell you i dont need these coupons
5610200 and yes we are buying you a new scooty next month
5610201 nothing as such dear i hardly use the scooty actually
5610202 true but now that you know how to ride i meant the scooty why go walking right
5610203 and i was planning to buy you a new one this month
5610204 playing with all these great golfers out here and competing with those great golfers i think is going to make me develop my game and give me lots of confidence when i get ready for the u s amateur
5610205 i think its a good opportunity to play in this
5610206 all i was trying to do was not make any mistakes
5610207 the more you play it the more you find out about the course where not to miss it especially
5610208 its going to be more about hitting fairways getting the ball in play off the tee versus a couple of years ago when the rough was down and you could really hit it anywhere out there its going to be a premium hitting fairways
5610209 the bad thing is i couldnt play a practice round at pinehurst so ill have to just use my caddie for playing those courses
5610210 i believe i need to move to a level where i can use confidence as a way to play better
5610211 i struggle to play my best golf when theres no pressure
5610212 the next level for me is about accepting im a three time major winner taking the confidence from that and that will help me earlier in tournaments so i dont have to put myself through the mill
5610213 ive got a deep down confidence that i can battle through anything
5610214 i need to have more flamboyant confidence at the start
5610215 obviously ive been the no 1 european player for six years it is interesting that it has taken these major wins to get that across
5610216 theres no doubt ill always make myself available to help anybody else but in that sense winning a couple of majors may make people seek advice from me during that week
5610217 its such a high in my career it very easily could be the last high and many players have failed at this point in the past
5610218 fine when you go we wont transfer you well put you in as you quit and if the other branch calls for a reference ill give you a bad review and tell them you never came in on time and called out all the time
5610219 we are going to take on an underdog role in this ryder cup for the first time in a long time even on paper when you look at the strength of the european squad
5610220 i will definitely watch some of the ryder cup matches and will be pulling hard for the american team i wish i could do more than root
5610221 i dont know what the doctors are going to tell me about playing golf down the road im taking it day to day week to week
5610222 this is like his retirement fund he plays good here every year
5610223 i was pleased to meet tiger woods last night that was very exciting im president of his fan club he spoke to the team and had the chance to visit with a lot of the players if you ask me and its just my opinion hes global he is the no 1 superstar in all of sports at least on my list he hits all the shots all the time hes got complete mental control hes unbelievable hopefully some of that rubs off on us
5610224 while there is never a good time for an injury the timing of this injury was especially disappointing for me considering that it forced me to miss the open championship and it comes in a ryder cup year
5610225 on the back nine my caddie mike powell and i were reciting bible verses and i just lost track of what score i was at
5610226 anytime you get to represent your country and play in the junior ryder cup it is an honor i am excited to play on the american team this year

5610229 if you have written about why verizon can cheerfully trumpet fios all over the airwaves but still doesnt have it in the city and wont say when it will be there i missed the story
5610230 while weve not announced plans to offer fios tv in baltimore city to date it remains a very important market to us
5610231 were in the middle of a massive transformational upgrade of our infrastructure and we simply cannot be everywhere at once
5610232 were working hard to bring the benefits of our fiber technology to as many people as quickly as possible
5610233 but as with all new technology this will take time as well as investment to accomplish
5610234 verizon has not yet begun franchise negotiations with baltimore city
5610235 but in areas where we have negotiated franchise agreements we have worked with the local jurisdictions on build out requirements
5610236 drive greater usage and revenue from the company s offerings
5610237 we hope that tube lines and the rmt can resolve this issue without unnecessary strike action
5610238 as far as were concerned two people doing the same job should get the same rate of pay
5610239 they work for different companies but they work for a company that operates on london underground
5610240 we want to reach a resolvent sic to it and we hope that common sense prevails and theres agreement thats satisfactory to the company and our membership
5610241 not all my employees are members of the rmt and we have some people who are qualified to carry out some of the work needed to carry out a safe and reliable service
5610242 i was going through the scheme all week with the coaches
5610243 they finally put me on the punt return team and i just tried to take full advantage of the opportunity i was given
5610244 the more room you have to work with the better off you are i saw angelo the whole time i was just hoping he wasnt going to miss his block
5610245 its hard to deal with now because its not like were game planning what were going to do on third downs but i still think that makes an impact on the outcome of these preseason games
5610246 its always tough when you get the ball at the 1 yard line initially we ran the ball the guys up front pounded it and kenny watson had some nice runs we strung together good plays and capped it with a touchdown
5610247 its not like he had to catch up in a hurry its not like he has to learn chinese or anything hes fine
5610248 im real proud of the team and the results we delivered in light of the environment
5610249 they see things a little bit weaker than they were expecting but not a heck of a lot
5610250 we think its consumers buying in bulk at some of the wholesale discount places to get lower unit costs on their food
5610251 sure but all the good topics already have established sites today so its too hard to compete

5610254 the clock is ticking for the chinese government to demonstrate its good faith regarding these so called protest zones
5610255 we think that you do not really understand chinas reality china has its own version and way of exercising our democracy
5610256 justifiable concerns about the whereabouts and safety of those individuals
5610257 china is presenting itself as a place with democratic freedoms where everyone has the right to protest even during the olympics but in reality the protest permits wont be granted
5610258 i have lived all over since i became homeless including tunnels warehouses on the street and the houses of friends and relatives
5610259 what they have done to us is unlawful and unfair
5610260 i have always believed in my government even though i have lost everything my possessions my home and my job were taken away from me i dont feel like a citizen anymore
5610261 its very exciting when our news makes it to yahoo coms top features
5610262 its like a firehose blasting us with up to 800 000 page views in just a couple of hours weve had placements that have accounted for up to 27 percent of the days page views and 65 percent of the days unique visitors
5610263 more than the bursts and spikes sharing our content with yahoo brings a steady growth in traffic to our site which provides us with more inventory to sell to our advertisers
5610264 our overall partnership with yahoo has been game changing and has brought new energy to our content and business
5610265 i want to come back and play with chad t j and carson palmer and everybody else
5610266 you already know what i can do on the field im just trying to get out there make plays and help any team out that i have a chance to play for

5610280 we had a chat with rob and we just put forward out case and said if you are thinking of leaving fremantle consider us and that was about it really
5610281 i think robbie is on radar for a lot of clubs
5610282 but robbie has got to make a decision as to where his future lies
5610283 our vision is he is the no 2 ruckman at freo but there is an opportunity to come and play first ruck not only for us but i guess the other clubs that are speaking to him
5610284 he is a big boy and he is a melbourne based boy who looks likely he is coming back to melbourne so of course from a recruiting perspective we would be in the marketplace for him
5610285 we probably are looking for another ruckman so he would on our radar

5610290 elliptically told through static long shots that convey the settings natural if dilapidating beauty the characters attempt to patch up their lives after an unseen disaster
5610291 a contemplative and intoxicating drama that bristles with wit and visual acuity
5610292 the resolutely static camera minimal dialogue and music the disaffected and practically mute male lead obsession with sexual longing and dissatisfaction and tension between an ascetic style and narrative unpredictability

5610311 god is going to punish you if you dont return it
5610312 superficially one thinks of revealed relgion as providing answers and smith provides as many questions as he does answers nobody is exempt from struggling with who he is whether youre and insider or an outsider thinking about smith causes you to struggle and that struggle brings as much of you into the question as it does smith himself hes a bit of a religious rorschach test
5610313 our people knew hate they knew what it was like to have their prophet murdered in cold blood their blood was then spread across six states we are a church that has had an extermination order issued against us that is unprecedented in the history of this god fearing nation
5610314 how can i become a prophet like joseph smith because unlike joseph god doesnt speak to me
5610315 the very land itself infused people with a sense of doom that the end was nigh
5610316 over 150 years later people are still arguing over the ghosts of mmm
5610317 i have no doubt mormons participated in the killing i pray that the lord will comfort those that are still bereaved by it and i pray that he can find a way to forgive those who took such a terrible action against their fellow beings
5610318 i wish to state categorically that this church has nothing to do with those that practice polygamy
5610319 there is no such thing as a mormon fundamentalist it is a contradiction to use those two terms together

5610327 i dont think i played a game healthy last season i was at about 50 or 60 at best
5610328 when i had another scan on the knee this summer it had not improved so i came back early to try to fix it at the beginning of pre season
5610329 i am not going to set a timetable but i am close
5610330 i am working on my fitness every day and while i have not joined in with the lads yet hopefully it will happen this week
5610331 whether i am fit for portsmouth or the match after that the most important thing is i am healthy for the rest of the season
5610332 i know how much i better i can get being around the players and coaching staff here

5610342 im a little tired its not easy to warm up in the morning
5610343 my point was to forget about what happened in the prelims and i did i came in this morning and its a brand new day and i felt better and mentally i felt much better than i did yesterday
5610344 i came back to priorities and what to think about at the right moment and it seems to be working out better for me
5610345 i just feel so sorry because there were so many people supporting me i told myself i had to run but i just couldnt do it
5610346 it was unbearable if i had finished the race i would have risked my tendon i could not describe my feeling at that moment
5610347 i never quit easily i am not that type of person
5610348 i think there will be a day when i will be better i think now the main thing is to quicken the recovery process to make the achilles tendon better
5610349 there will be more opportunities next year there will be more opportunities later i must be optimistic i cant complain about destiny
5610350 im one that cant accept failure easily i will rise up its in my character
5610351 to withdraw from a race is not to give up liu xiang had no choice and this was a moment of great courage
5610352 i knew i had trained very well but these guys who were with me at the front were really the big guys
5610353 i just tried to execute my own race as simon went i knew it was going to be tough i just had to bite and fight
5610354 this year ive lost all my races on sprints it teaches you a lesson and ive learned at the right time i guess
5610355 i gave it all i had and jan just kept coming
5610356 i was a little bit nervous with just those four guys there but it depends how much you want it
5610357 i didnt get it but sport is like that its not mathematics
5610358 i gave it everything i had to give i tried to charge in the third lap but it wasnt enough i had nothing more to do

5610363 and what you see is the emergence of an extraordinary financial management organization the lds churchs ownership in media extraordinary land holdings livestock agricultural interests great stock portfolios
5610364 today church assets are estimated at 25 to 30 billion dollars
5610365 but nobody was on the ground with us except the mormons in their yellow shirts
5610366 before the storm the object was to get rid of the missionaries as soon as possible after the storm its a little bit different now theyll never stand on my doorstep again without being invited into my house
5610367 during the first 25 years of the mormon church there were 71 000 converts in great britain alone
5610368 the church has a real problem keeping new members in the faith part of the reason for that is that the church does a marvelous job finding converts and bringing them into the church through baptism but it sprends less time and less effort helping new members of the church find their way in their new congregations
5610369 i was so completely wound up that if my mission president asked me to blow myself up like a suicide bomber i would have said sure where should i go
5610370 when the missionaries came into the outskirts of hell where i was at and knocked on my door i had been struggling with my two little children i had been hooked on drugs in prison on parole and i thought it is the police and they came in and told me the most preposterous story id ever heard in my life they told me about this white boy a dead angel and some gold plates and i thought hmmm i wonder what theyre on
5610371 i think the hardest public relations sell we have to make is this is the only true church
5610372 im glad someone owned up to it some around the nacle seem to think the church has lately been playing down this claim

5610374 its an incredible pressure on a woman and yes there is a strong use of anti depressant use in utah higher use than in other states
5610375 embracing the odd duck to me is the measure of true religion true religions says youre weird but i love you nonetheless thats what jesus would have done and so for me it is a great failure that the family can only be the family almost by the ozzie and harriet definition and anything outside of that is not a family at all
5610376 the knowledge that this is really going to happen that this isnt just something weve been taught in sunday school that we will go home and i will see my mother and my father that i will be home
5610377 religion rises inevitably from our apprehension of our own death to give meaning to meaninglessness is the endless quest of all relgion when death becomes the center of our consciousness then religion authentically begins of all religions that i know the one that most vehemently and persuasively defies and denies the reality of death is the original mormonism of the prophet seer and revelator joseph smith
5610378 im an intellectual and a happy member of the church
5610379 the original mormonism of the prophet seer and revelator joseph smith
5610380 yes here are people who have a negative viewpoint but just look at what those who are content with the lds church see
5610381 i was quite taken aback by harold blooms closing comment re
5610382 during my years outside the lds church i read blooms the american religion he has been quite consistent over the years in saying that lds ism is not the mormonism of jospeh smith
5610383 bedtime story 17 in the name of jesus christ amen
5610384 i watched the pbs series but was disappointed which is often the case when you know a lot about a particular subject and you watch an outsiders effort to tell the story
5610385 non lds such as bloom kathleen flake and sarah barringer gordon actually get mormonism and appreciate it more than most lds apologists and leaders
5610386 even worse have you heard the primary kids singing or should i say chanting
5610387 after watching i was more excited about being a mormon and more excited about mormonism than i ever feel after sacrament meeting honestly i really enjoyed the experience and had a great spiritual high
5610388 okay i get it were all a bunch of weirdos
5610389 9 31 hmmm in the context of this documentary watching kids sing
5610390 matt im confident you will keep this thread going for at least the next several weeks
5610391 they were taught to think for themselves but they now believe that truth is either whatever they make up their minds that it is or it is nothing at all
5610392 truth is knowledge of things as they were as they are and as they will be
5610393 ooooh look at me because i demonstrated that you were errant or poorly thought out in your beliefs and attitudes must make me someone special
5610394 only bless ing us with what we are ready to receive
5610395 only bless ing us with what we are ready to receive
5610396 look if the church could accept polygamy they could accept blacks as equal members given the ultra conservative prudish by todays standards victorian values of mid 19th century whites accomodating polygamy was a far greater stretch for the church than accomodating blacks among their midst
5610397 i could go on and on with ways in which the lds church has diverged from the religion of joseph smith but of course youd counter that this was just
5610398 joseph smiths revelation that deity was once a man is
5610399 arent we all hoping yet another shortening of the temple session given the work left to do not even brigham would begrude us that
5610400 brother anon in the name of jesus christ i lay my hands upon you for and in behalf of who is dead and declare you endowed
5610401 it is true that the church doesnt know much about that and so it doesnt teach much about it kind of like we know that our heavenly parents must have heavenly parents but we dont go teaching about it
5610402 anyone knows that the lord can only bless us with what we are ready to recieve the church membership was not ready to receive blacks
5610403 the church wants people to come to christ get baptized by the correct authority and be active in the church
5610404 after that is accomplished they can delve into interesting personal study
5610405 why would an organization ever put the complex ambiguous and for now non essential stuff first it would be like trying to teach first graders about the possible existence of extra dimensions
5610406 learn to be a god myself the same as all gods before us have done
5610407 jesus is the christ the eternal god manifesting himself unto all nations
5610408 how can we build the moral strength of our nation
5610409 the lord is aware of you and the hopes of your heart he will step out of his regular pattern to bless you in an especial way you will know of a certainty what your work is before this mission is through
5610410 lord this is not typical language must i take these words seriously he has said nothing about my studies my professional path my family or any other normal matter
5610411 but what i can no longer pretend to believe is that the lds its leaders and its ordinances are divinely mandated as necessary for ones salvation progression or exaltation
5610412 we put some urchins in a tank and got them feeding on algae then we recorded them the noise they were producing caused spikes at certain frequencies
5610413 the noise they make is the sound of those teeth scraping on the rocks a large urchin will have a low resonance frequency while a small urchin will have a higher frequency
5610414 when they emerge from their crevices at dusk they re probably really hungry munching away quite rapidly
5610415 they have another big feed before they go to sleep at dawn
5610416 it s a huge increase 20 to 30 decibels which is an increase of a hundred to a thousand times the background level
5610417 during the talks the two sides are expected to sign pacts on launching direct shipping and cargo charter flights
5610418 we have masses of water it s just that the water companies let everything leak into the rivers germans are being ripped off because our politicians are useless everything has been run wrong for 20 years
5610419 in the uk it seems to be constantly raining and yet the reservoirs seem to dry out so quickly you have towns flooded the whole time and yet hosepipe bans are in force
5610420 there s just not enough being spent on infrastructure and the pipelines are just really bad thames water is dreadful they blame it on the wartime damage that nothing s been really properly repaired since the 1940s
5610421 the approachable parent talking with your kids about bodies and birth
5610422 spam material can be obtained sometimes a general rule that parents should tell their children is dont say anything on msn or im that you wouldnt say to someone face to face a private information study from myspace shows the following personal details given out in points accidental viewing is a big concern if children are left unsupervised on the internet since it is very easy to view pornographic sites for example you think that it you are punching in the site pen island
5610423 were funded to win olympic medals were not funded to finish fourth to eighth some sports will take fourth to eighth as important but if we recognise that someone isnt going to make the podium we remove them were in the business of thoroughbreds we cant make thoroughbreds out of donkeys
5610424 everyone on our programme knows that theyre here because theyre potentially a medallist and i think that creates a certain culture so as soon as we recognise someone isnt of the level required we stop right there were not malicious but we are very brutally honest with people including ourselves
5610425 that doesnt mean to say were soft if our lads walk into training five minutes late we say sorry thanks for coming but off you go home but bawling at people creates a sense of fear and i dont believe that brings the best out of people
5610426 well see if they can turn their attention to governance and get a handle on their problems they have been using the musharraf thing as an excuse for non governance
5610427 this is really the moment of truth for pakistan if this fails it is unclear what will happen
5610428 it will take the new government a full year to work things out on counterterrorism a year to make the mistakes they have to make it is a huge experiment
5610429 the resignation of president pervez musharraf is a step toward moving pakistan onto a more stable political footing pakistan is a critical theatre in countering the threat of al qaeda and violent islamic extremism and i look forward to the government increasing its future cooperation
5610430 he hasn t effectively been leading pakistan for the last six months
5610431 you re truly not going to see any great changes in pakistan with musharraf s resignation with the exception you will start to see greater political infighting among the coalition partners
5610432 you could count on him to make tough decisions even though you could never count on him to completely follow through
5610433 it will probably be much harder to get decisive action as we did with musharraf the good news is that the democracy process is moving forward and it may be possible to create a more durable political framework

5610455 theres an old baseball adage hit em where they aint
5610456 this didnt grow of thinking lets do something different with our noon news
5610457 the retired and the unemployed with a smattering of stay at home moms
5610458 this is an interesting move and my guess is its a positive one
5610459 i love the idea that someones trying something thats a little different trying something at 9 a m makes all the sense in the world
5610460 since the network morning shows have started gaining audience local tv has started adding more programming
5610461 a noon newscast has never been a big moneymaker for stations
5610462 youve got to run in the morning which is the growth spot for tv news and youve got to run in the evening when the audience is largest noon news works into the schedule well which is probably why stations are doing it youve got people sitting around in the newsroom on the clock so why not use them
5610463 largely female stay at home moms who are sitting down for a cup of coffee and want to catch up on whats happening in the world
5610464 there will not be a lot of celebrity news but if renee zellweger wants to come back to baltimore and shoot another movie shes going to be much more willing to appear on a 9 a m newscast that she will at 5 in the morning
5610465 ini semua bukan karena faktor kesengajaan kami tidak mengira terjadi tragedi di momen yang sangat penting ini
5610466 kami minta maaf kepada peserta upacara dan warga yang melihat tragedi memilukan ini
5610467 kami sudah menjalankan apa yang menjadi tugas dari tim ini
5610468 uang tersebut memang uang asli tetapi sudah dimusnahkan karena sudah lusuh atau tidak layak pakai
5610469 kami belum ketemu dengan yang menemukannya apa maksudnya mengambil uang itu
5610470 kabarnya uang itu oleh penemunya digunakan untuk membakar batu bata bukan untuk yang lain
5610471 dude tte are you up for a threesome with scarlett
5610472 i would give my left receptacle to be in a threesome with scarlett it would be the best thing to ever happen to me in my sweet short life i would prostrate myself at the feet of this blonde godess sic for a chance to participate it would be like kissing liquid gold i cant wait to enter the contest mmmmmmmmmmmmmm
5610473 access to the president doesnt mean youre going to get the truth
5610474 he never really aspired to be president but lightning struck
5610475 he turned out to be a good president because he really restored confidence in the oval office and a sense of security in the country after watergate
5610476 missed his calling he would have been a great minister
5610477 they reagan advisers james baker ed meese and michael deaver taught him to say this is not a press conference they had him quite trained on that
5610478 at the tail end both he and mrs bush began to think we were the cause of all their troubles so the press was not liked at all
5610479 clinton was denied his legitimacy as president by the ultra right in this country
5610480 he was asked so many personal questions no president has ever been subjected to that kind of tyranny
5610481 theres a blackout now i believe until the end of his term
5610482 helen represents what is necessary to make our democracy function at its highest level journalists asking tough questions of presidents
5610483 its still the only way the public can get the information to make educated choices
5610484 the surgery went as planned and annie is now recuperating at home
5610485 annie would like to send her thanks and appreciation to all that have sent their well wishes in the past few days
5610486 i should have been attending the final press blitz of the week but my back suddenly went into spasm last night giving me more pain that ive ever experienced in my life and a totally numb left foot
5610487 that sinking feeling doesnt mean you to have swim alone
5610488 lips like clockwork because hes kissed a lot of flowers
5610489 you dont get me im not the type to quit
5610490 about how our lives are often dependent on the perceptions others have of us
5610491 it had a successful production at the national arts centre but i want to add to it
5610492 i believe passionately in the relationship between classical and new work thats been true of the great classic theatres including the royal shakespeare company and the national theatre of britain for a long time
5610493 we still have a frelling ace up our sleeve its an ace a frelling ace at tgs tokyo game show the capcom booth stage is going to make peoples balls pucker up its going to be big
5610494 like the scar of age its written all over my face the war is still raging inside of me
5610495 there was a lot of rain and hail coming down and then the windows on the house and the ranch sliders started rattling and moving some of them by several inches it was quite scary
5610496 i went outside and checked the cowshed a couple of 25 000 litre water tanks had been lifted by the twister they were empty but lashed to the fence
5610497 det r bara att komma igen och tr na nnu h rdare
5610498 then my soul will rejoice in the lord exulting in his salvation
5610499 for he sees that even the wise die the fool and the stupid alike must perish and leave their wealth to others
5610500 o god you know my folly the wrongs i have done are not hidden from you
5610501 taken to the soiled utility room and left alone to die
5610502 clarifying that the act would not be used to undermine roe vs wade
5610503 construed to affirm deny expand or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being born alive
5610504 what duties are owed to a non viable child born alive
5610505 are these babies medical waste or persons protected by the constitution obamas reaction was to consider them non entities under roe v wade until they were viable even when they were gasping outside the mother
5610506 anything promoted by pro life groups the pro choice democrats just wouldnt be for it
5610507 they just didnt want to give the pro life groups a victory
5610508 any allegation of any wrongdoing is nothing more than trash

5610510 wait you were sixteen in beijing why does your passport say you are sixteen again
5610511 the desperation of these crimes speaks to the broader issue of where we are in terms of this economy
5610512 when people become this desperate they take desperate acts and we have to do everything we can to get to the root causes of crime and violence
5610513 i would be enormously doubtful if that were the case
5610514 robbery is a dreadful way of making money and suggests things that are clearly not cyclical to employment opportunities
5610515 it robbery makes no economic sense but there is an emotional and recreational reward of dominating people
5610516 thats who they are and thats what theyre getting back at
5610517 practically no one ive ever heard of when you average time in prison has ever beat the minimum wage by robbing stores banks and restaurants
5610518 weve had some customers whove noticed the change and they appreciate it
5610519 one customer said he didnt want to worry about being robbed when he takes his family out to dinner its on peoples minds
5610520 we still havent decided just how well go with the bench
5610521 were still looking at it and will make a decision later
5610522 for whatever reason we havent won there so far and it wont be any easier this time not after the dragons knocked over the broncos in brisbane last week
5610523 ive seen real estate ads with views to the sky tower
5610524 ive never heard a negative word about it from people buying a house or selling i cant think why they would say that
5610525 the tax dept cant put something in writing and then arbitrarily go back and reverse their decisions and charge back taxes on that as well
5610526 clearly some of the industry player have been paying gst some havent its really important we get the facts on the table so we can work out what would be a fair solution to everyone
5610527 betonte enke der bei der europameisterschaft die nummer 2 war
5610528 auf der einen seite w re ich nat rlich froh wenn ich die gesamte mannschaft zur verf gung h tte andererseits k nnen wir etwas ausprobieren
5610529 sagte l w mit dem hinweis dass auf dem langen weg zur wm 2010 in s dafrika der ein oder andere akteur auch mal ausfallen werde
5610530 sagte er 17 akteure z hlte waren am montag bei der ersten trainingseinheit dabei christoph metzelder von real madrid der im spanischen supercup nur auf der bank gesessen hatte war erst sp ter angereist
5610531 manchmal ist es in solchen spielen auch ein vorteil nicht nur mit etablierten anzutreten
5610532 it is the spectacle of people who might be different thats all it is
5610533 the tourists appear to have little regard for the neighborhood and its residents and view the stop as akin to visiting a zoo or other attraction where they are entertained by exhibits or animals
5610534 they come down from twin peaks on the way to civic center
5610535 the tour guide told me to stop there for about 20 minutes so they can get out
5610536 many of them seem uncomfortable or shocked by their surroundings
5610537 youve got these throngs of people walking up and down market and 18th holding hands to make it clear that they are heterosexual
5610538 they come in here 15 or 20 at a time
5610539 they look around take a picture and then they walk out in the last three months ive sold one bottle of water it is not worth having so much traffic were not a photo album
5610540 the guy from muni says it is already illegal to park there
5610541 but now he says we have to make it officially illegal its absurd
5610542 they were unhappy with the situation and they wanted it stopped
5610543 well just get the sisters of perpetual indulgence on this
5610544 a few blessings from them and those tour buses would disappear
5610545 someone who finds its likely that their name has been placed on a government watch list will get their day in court
5610546 i reached out grabbed him by the scruff of the neck and pulled him off
5610547 i just couldnt in my own heart say that i left that bear out there to die
5610548 we dont want him to be looking for people as a handout or a source for food in the future the more he dislikes us the better
5610549 we do not believe we can sit idly by when the principles of democracy are being shredded
5610550 it establishes a significant footprint of ownership and potential future ownership across the wellington region
5610551 and it provides the basis for movement forward between both the crown and taranaki whanui
5610552 with this settlement taranaki whanui is also making history by becoming the first settling group to offer a statement of forgiveness to the crown
5610553 hindi po ako galit sa kanya dahil alam ko naman na may nagtatanggol sa akin enough na po yun thank you kasi nababanggit mo ako di ba bilang isang joey de leon maraming maraming salamat more power sa show nila positive na lang tayo
5610554 naintindihan na ni ms ai ai yun okey na yun tsaka isa pa hindi naman siya makitid na tao
5610555 ay ano po sabi nga nila kung hindi talaga kayo huwag mong pilitin malamang mas may nakalaang mas maganda di ba yun lang yon hindi naman lahat ng gusto mo sa mundo makukuha mo
5610556 tsaka hindi naman direktang sinabi sa akin na kasama ako sa pelikula may nakapagsabi lang pagka ganun hanggat hindi nagro roll yung camera huwag tayong umasa sa mga project hindi ako nag expect
5610557 yes why not pero malay mo naman in the near future may trabaho kami na pagsasamahan
5610558 masaya siya sa ginagawa niya hayaan na lang natin siya
5610559 kasi naman hindi ako marunong mag computer e hindi ko nga alam lumabas yun sa you tube you tube na yan may nakapagsabi lang sa akin na mga kaibigan sa press
5610560 actually dapat ko pa nga siyang pasalamatan kasi dahil doon nalaman ko ang daming nagmamahal sa akin nabasa ko yung comment na ang dami dami talaga may positive at negative
5610561 yung negative alam naman natin kasi oo hindi ako maganda alam na natin yun hindi na kailangang i ano given naman yun tanggap ko na yun tsaka yun po ang bread and butter ko di ba im sure kung maganda ako baka wala akong mga blessings na ganito karami
5610562 they were going to close us down if we didnt turn the music down
5610563 its only a once in a year event we didnt hear a thing from here
5610564 once i injured the ankle in trials i knew what lies in store still instead of backtracking i decided to give it a go after all this is olympics and i have put in a lot of efforts just for this occasion
5610565 my choice for mccains secretary of state would be robert gates the current secretary of defense mr gates is an advocate of a strong military supplemented by vigorous soft power or public diplomacy and economic aid remarkable for a secretary of defense he has argued that the state department is under budgeted and understaffed a new secretary of state will face major challenges among them keeping terrorism at bay burnishing americas image as a beacon of freedom and preserving its superpower role as new rising nations seek to share it
5610566 the attitude of the police the lack of any public disorder on any previous occasions and the fact that 80 000 to 100 000 people have voted with their feet and watched the parade leads me to the view is uncertain and or unreasonable in the way it refers to offensive
5610567 we have deemed in our legal system that the right of the pornography industry to advertise on a main street is more important than the right of families to be protected
5610568 im sick of fighting this every year when i believe it is a right
5610569 so lets do it once and for all we will go to court we will drag it all through the courts they can spend their money ill spend my money

5610574 hendrix came in with these dylan tapes and we all heard them for the first time in the studio
5610575 recording these new ideas meant he would have to erase something
5610576 i liked jimi hendrixs record of this and ever since he died ive been doing it that way strange how when i sing it i always feel its a tribute to him in some kind of way
5610577 there is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home
5610578 just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
5610579 in our experiments we explore couplings between atoms in proteins
5610580 our goal is to translate genomic information into high resolution structural information and thereby be able to better understand the function of the proteins
5610581 with increased speed and sensitivity we can obtain very high resolution spectra
5610582 and because we can resolve thousands of signals at a time one for each atom in the sample we can determine the structure of the entire protein
5610583 using this technique we can more precisely define the fragments of the molecule and how they are oriented
5610584 that allows us to define protein features and determine structure at the atomic scale
5610585 when we found the contamination it was another sign that the way we currently manufacture heparin is simply unsafe
5610586 unlike the current heparin that is harvested from possibly disease carrying animals in often very poor conditions our fully synthetic heparin will be created in a pharmaceutical manufacturing environment from fermentation to packaging this will give drug manufacturers extreme control over the safety and purity of the product
5610587 ultimately drug companies are going to need to produce tons of this drug to keep up with global demand
5610588 such levels of productions are further down the road we think that in five years it is very possible that this drug could reach human clinical trials
5610589 this work demonstrates that we can get a complete genome for a totally unknown organism
5610590 we extracted a complete genome from a very complex community and this is something novel
5610591 you can only use amplification when you know what youre trying to get and thats the problem
5610592 when you want to discover something unknown amplification is a very deficient technique because you keep discovering the things you already know so how can you discover the unknown
5610593 these are the bacteria that maintain the earths health some of the methane escapes in some parts of the lake you can see the bubbles but whatever doesnt escape as bubbles these bacteria do a very good job of eating it
5610594 in addition to providing clear benefits for women and their families by helping women avoid pregnancies they do not want and plan the pregnancies they do studies show that family planning clinic services save 4 3 billion in public funds each year
5610595 filling a big need for low income women and providing a really important service
5610596 suggests that private providers are beginning to focus on the contraceptive needs of women
5610597 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
5610598 and i also feel that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
5610599 that does not mean we exclude people from our party who are pro choice
5610600 pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
5610601 i think mccain has to have a running mate that clearly connects with social conservatives in the party
5610602 that is where he is lacking so if he picks a pro choice running mate i dont see how he can win this race
5610603 stay home but there is a core of voters whose level of enthusiasm influences people further from the core so if mccain picks a pro choice running mate the strength of turnout on election day is not going to be there for him
5610604 add up to one thing the public thinks mccain just might be a moderate on abortion
5610605 recognize d differing views on this question among americans in general and in our own p arty
5610606 in truth it was his 2000 position on abortion that was the outlier a short lived attempt to court the center
5610607 seem to be enough to convince the electorate that mccains votes honestly represent his beliefs
5610608 question is whether pro choice voters are going to take a chance on mccain
5610609 our travels to complete this film have been life changing i have met so many wonderful people and so many wonderful animals people keep contacting us wanting to make donations so while i was traveling i was also seeking the rescue organization that deserved the money and needed the money the most i was on a journey to find the place where the money would do the most good i found it villa lobos pit bull rescue in canyon country california absolutely blew my mind many of you will remember that pixie from la ink who is also featured in our documentary took the cameras from tlc and featured a special trip to villa lobos on the show pixie is the one who recommended to me that i go and i am forever grateful to her for the suggestion i began the donation process with a rather sizable check from my own personal bank account but more importantly i have begun a personal crusade to raise money for this facility with the help of you guys our loyal friends fans clients and family i know for a fact that at villa lobos dogs are being helped more than any other facility i have been to while creating this documentary for the last 2 years this location is the largest pit bull rescue in the country and has over 200 dogs at all times all of which are happy to be there and treated with an amazing amount of attention love medical care and respect tia maria torres is an incredible woman who is doing incredible things but she needs help it costs over 600 per day just to keep it going the truth is she needs a lot more than that it is the cleanest and best kept rescue operation i have ever seen as well and to maintain this level of comfort for these animals is also expensive please help us to raise some money for this magical place 1 5 10 20 500 1000 10 000 no donation is too small or too large not one penny will be kept from the mouths of these dogs and with villa lobos i can personally guarantee not one penny will go to waste if you cannot afford to donate you can still help us help them simply help us spread the word please help draw more attention to villa lobos and our film which features them please repost this as often as possible and send this out to your entire address book of contacts i feel incredibly fortunate to have actually physically been in so many wonderful facilities and met so many wonderful people im here to tell you though villa lobos is the bomb diggity
5610610 i came back to the uk and got wheeled off the plane a first i must say i felt a bit like elizabeth taylor

5610632 yo criado entre jornaleros e hijo de un pueblo jornalero por excelencia morisco o andaluz hab a vivido la tragedia de la andaluc a secularmente martirizada de un pueblo que soportaba con musulmana resignaci n y arist crata mansedumbre
5610633 todo latifundio andaluz es ilegal en su origen hay que devolver al campesino andaluz la tierra que le fue arrebatada por derecho de conquista
5610634 los andaluces hispano romanos llamaron a sus vecinos ber beres
5610635 la etapa de al andalus fue de libertad y brillo cultural
5610636 la conquista cristiana fue intolerable y uno de los or genes del latifundio
5610637 las cruzadas el robo y el asesinato presididos por la cruz
5610638 el rencor europeo o de animalidad europea que se ofreci a la historia con el nombre de fervor cat lico se ensa contra esta cultura superior de al andalus no s lo por odio al nombre musulm n que la designaba sino por el temor de que su fuerza cautivante de las almas descubriese la verdadera naturaleza de la inspiraci n animal que rigi la conquista
5610639 los moros andaluces viven en el destierro desde hace cuatro siglos
5610640 m s de un mill n de hermanos nuestros de andaluces inicuamente expulsados de su solar las causas de los pueblos jam s prescriben hay esparcidos desde t nger hasta damasco

5610655 i think its imperative that the following step be taken
5610656 t he banking problems in the united states continue to mount while the federal governments deficit continues to soar out of control
5610657 when central banks intervene in the currency markets they exchange their currency for dollars
5610658 theres a crisis in the white house and to save the election theyd have to fake a war
5610659 washingtons bloody fingerprints are all over the invasion of south ossetia
5610660 yo sol a ser partidario de la apertura y la tolerancia de la diferencia pero ahora veo ad nde nos est llevando
5610661 en grandes entidades del tercer sector el personal directivo tiene unos sueldos millonarios mientras que quienes llevan sobre sus hombros lo m s duro del trabajo cobran menos de 800 o 900 euros al mes
5610662 el primer convenio nacional del sector de intervenci n social ha sido impugnado
5610663 que consideran que salarios mensuales de 900 euros netos podr an ser generadores de amenaza de ruina para sus entidades
5610664 la responsabilidad social corporativa de las empresas debe ser reconocida por las administraciones p blicas y por las entidades del tercer sector
5610665 no deben ser generadoras de trabajos precarios o con remuneraciones muy por debajo del salario que se pueda cobrar en el sector p blico
5610666 en los programas de empleo de la administraci n un 50 por ciento de los servicios son sostenidos a trav s de subcontrataci n
5610667 bye bye darlings have a wonderful trip and dont talk to strangers
5610668 the events in the caucasus show clearly that such security guarantees are indispensable
5610669 we believe that missile defense is a substantial contribution to natos collective security
5610670 loyalty to the us and receive material benefits for the americans it is an opportunity to expand its military presence across the world including closer to russia for nato this is an additional risk many nato countries are unhappy with this including the germans and the french
5610671 a program could be implemented to create orbital ballistic missiles capable of reaching us territory via the south pole skirting us air defense bases
5610672 when you play so nicely like this i think you deserve a big hug special treat extra privilege
5610673 if you dont settle down ill have to ask you to leave the room and return when you can stay here quietly
5610674 desde madre coraje llevamos trabajando 16 a os en el pa s andino para evitar que las consecuencias de desastres naturales de este tipo sean de tanta magnitud mediante el fortalecimiento de las infraestructuras y la mejora de las condiciones de vida por ello es imprescindible la ayuda continuada y constante de todos

5610678 she has died the good woman mrs lia waldman daughter of the nagybaner rav may her soul be entwined in the bouquet of life
5610679 los objetivos que nos planteamos antes de comenzar este viaje fueron analizar la situaci n sanitaria de la poblaci n de bluefields para detectar posibles deficiencias y necesidades a nivel de formaci n y de medios formar al personal del hospital en fisioterapia de preparaci n al parto atenci n durante el mismo y post parto y por otro lado estudiar la situaci n en cuanto a las enfermedades de transmisi n sexual prevenci n del embarazo riesgos de transmisi n etc
5610680 los resultados han sido muy satisfactorios manifest sof a s nchez porque hemos colaborado de manera maravillosa con el personal del hospital de bluefields el ndice de asistencia ha sido muy elevado la gente ha estado muy motivada con el curso realizado muy receptivos porque ellos no pueden realizar all ning n tipo de formaci n por falta de recursos econ micos su pr ctica diaria es similar a la que hab a en hospitales espa oles hace 60 a os los materiales y las instalaciones est n bajo m nimos las condiciones son muy precarias
5610681 hablamos de una poblaci n en la que las mujeres se quedan embarazadas siendo muy ni as a los 12 o 13 a os y hay much simos abusos sexuales tienen acceso a todo tipo de anticonceptivos que el gobierno da de manera gratuita en los centros de salud preservativos p ldora del d a despu s etc sin embargo no los usan porque no tienen esa educaci n ese es el principal problema que hemos detectado a adi s nchez en cuanto a la preparaci n al parto nos encontramos con ni as de 12 a os que no tienen madurez ni f sica ni mental para asumir un embarazo para llevar un parto en las mejores condiciones llegan con mucho miedo aportan poca colaboraci n y una nula afectividad hacia ese beb porque a lo mejor proviene de un abuso sexual por parte de su padre de un primo no es un embarazo deseado
5610682 es importante establecer un programa de recuperaci n postparto para prevenir posibles patolog as en la madre incontinencia urinaria prolapsos genitales dolores pelvianos y para educar a la madre en los cuidados postnatales del beb para llevar a cabo de manera eficaz estos programas es necesario proveer al hospital de determinado material colchonetas silla de parto ba era de dilataci n electroestimulador perineal y facilitar la formaci n continuada del personal sanitario involucrado el cual tiene una excelente predisposici n y especial motivaci n en este proyecto
5610683 left and right all americans know that freedom is better that slavery that love is better than hate kindness better than cruelty tolerance better than bigotry we dont always know how we know these things and yet mysteriously we know them nonetheless
5610684 the true complexity arises when we must defend these values in a world that does not universally embrace them when we reach the place where we must be intolerant in order to defend tolerance or unkind in order to defend kindness or hateful in order to defend what we love
5610685 whoever is kind to the cruel will end up being cruel to the kind
5610686 members of the antiwar movement wound up being involved in the betrayal of far eastern nations in a genocide and in the suffering today imposed on 30 million people there do those convinced pacifists hear the moans coming from there do they understand their responsibility today or do they prefer not to hear
5610687 a country is not just what it does it is also what it tolerates
5610688 were properly addressed by relevant authorities or departments through consultations
5610689 the clock is ticking for the chinese government to demonstrate its good faith regarding these so called protest zones
5610690 we think that you do not really understand chinas reality china has its own version and way of exercising our democracy
5610691 justifiable concerns about the whereabouts and safety of those individuals
5610692 there is no role for speculation or speculators today this is kaput
5610693 if we were second world war generals weve exposed our flanks weve been wiped out this is about fundamentals this is about losing money
5610694 i fear that the central bankers of the world are fighting yesterdays battle
5610695 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5610696 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5610697 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5610698 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5610699 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5610700 make a list of what you were grateful for in bill gwatneys life
5610701 a great deal still depends on the decisions and good judgment of the next president
5610702 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent
5610703 all his bluster distortions and negative attacks notwithstanding it is hard to understand how senator mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5610704 the difference in this race is that john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5610705 first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5610706 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5610707 because he has the judgment vision and character to lead this country in the 21st century
5610708 its because of that experience that when i hear that women are being treated unfairly in the workplace where theres injustice and were not seeing the basic principle of equal pay for equal work i get mad and i get frustrated
5610709 we think that operation sentinel and a lot of the surveillance initiatives that the police are planning are an attack on our right to privacy here in new york
5610710 time to maintain this information to enable us to check and see if any information has surfaced concerning a vehicle coming into the city
5610711 we fought the americans for four years and we fought al qaeda too
5610712 we are an experienced armed group we are fully capable of bringing the house down
5610713 it has put money in the local economy and reduced attacks on coalition forces
5610714 until a decade ago gay people were seen as a security threat and as recently as two decades ago they were being witch hunted
5610715 it takes the monitoring and the exposure of products of incomplete combustion to yet another level of potential impact on peoples health
5610716 if you have an understanding of how these are formed and then can figure out how they interact in a biological way then you can have a basic understanding of how diseases progress and are formed
5610717 our job is to figure out and determine how to link the exposure with the disease
5610718 were working on determining just what types of radicals the breadth of how many radicals could be formed what sources could be responsible
5610719 the u s is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5610720 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
5610721 we have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over
5610722 probably fannie mae and freddie mac despite what u s treasury secretary hank paulson said these giant mortgage guarantee agencies are not going to exist in their present form in a few years
5610723 there was this view early on in the crisis that sovereign wealth funds could save everybody investment banks did something stupid they lost money in the sub prime theyre great buys sovereign wealth funds come in and make a lot of money by buying them
5610724 that view neglects the point that the financial system has become very bloated in size and needed to shrink
5610725 the tree has multiple trunks and each has many living branches
5610726 we are hopeful that it will have new sprouting and that it will live
5610727 thank you for your courage for protecting civilians for standing in the way of those who brought death to the people of south ossetia
5610728 georgian infrastructure will be rebuilt georgias economy will be reinforced
5610729 they could not do anything bad to the people because there were no people in the town
5610730 the russians have to keep their promises this is a never ending story and there is not a single sign that they will begin the withdrawal as they said they would
5610731 i think its the most beautiful performance in the world
5610732 are a priority of our nation so we think our thing is the best
5610733 it just amazes me i dont see how the american public in the end gains by all of the theatrics
5610734 mr mandracchia and the others theyre all of good will and theyre a little frustrated by lawyers arguing
5610735 the last thing we want to do is prolong this
5610736 if we are finally permitted to put on our case we will show everyone we have a very strong case
5610737 theres nothing she could say that would make their case
5610738 a distraction from what were trying to do at the park
5610739 and that doesnt serve the public the community or our heritage
5610740 i want a cinnamon roll for lunch mama its a fruit
5610741 demi and stretch put your heels together so they love one another
5610742 i hurt my lip there are no band aids for lips i think ill live
5610743 when you say lotta you need to use an english accident
5610744 the best way to lower childrens fluoride intake as health canada suggests is to stop fluoridation
5610745 it makes no sense to prescribe fluoride drugs to children via the water supply at levels which are between 150 and 250 times higher than the level in mothers milk
5610746 these meetings will give the public information they dont get from our government or dental organizations
5610747 in the afternoon a panel will address the question of whether toronto should stop fluoridating its water in the evening experts will explain fluorides dangers to health
5610748 the best way that the oda can get communities and politicians to stand up for water fluoridation is to provide in person a cogent and scientifically referenced defense of fluoridation at the afternoon forum
5610749 the weight of evidence does not support a link between fluoride and intelligence quotient deficit

5610755 we think this years high earnings growth will not be sustainable into next year
5610756 next year the banks may face higher credit costs and that may lower earnings growth
5610757 the positive earnings revision cycle over the past 12 months looks to be ending as nims net interest margins are reaching a plateau and credit risks are rising as chinas economy faces potentially greater than expected slowdown risks
5610758 the odd bit of profit taking maybe but i think the stakes theyve got are quite unique and they wouldnt be in a rush to sell unless they were really financially stretched

5610900 the pent up anger of teachers and other government employees against the oppressive policies of gsis under winston garcia cannot be underestimated
5610901 in many cases gsis is so ruthless in demanding its pound of flesh that retirees are left with nothing
5610902 we are documenting the complaints and then well submit them to the gsis for urgent action
5610903 i was penniless when i retired ito ba ang hinihintay ng mga teachers sa aming is this what the teachers are waiting for on their retirement day ito ba ang ipinagmamalaki ng pamahalaan ni gloria arroyo at winston garcia is this what the administration of gloria macapagal arroyo and winston garcia boasting of
5610904 kung di ka naman delingkwente hindi ka naman mahihirapan you should not find it difficult to pay your loans if you are not delinquent
5610905 kapag kasi may utang pa ang mga teachers sa ibang lending institutions at mababawasan na ang kanilang required take home pay na p3 000 this is because if the teachers have loans from other lending institutions and the teachers take home pay would go lower than the required p3 000 the deped no longer deducts the payment to gsis

5610909 the previous regime armed with its arrogance and intolerant ideology reduced man to a force of production it reduced gifted and autonomous people to nuts and bolts of some monstrously huge noisy stinking machine whose real meaning was not clear to anyone it could do no more but slowly and inexorably wear itself out and all the nuts and bolts too
5610910 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
5610911 politicians judges and the godly are trying to turn religion into an equal opportunities cause the language sounds the same as in the 20th century but the consequences could not be more different instead of fighting for equality they are demanding special treatment and the social fragmentation that goes with it
5610912 there is a very important obligation on the school to ensure that its pupils are first tolerant as to the religious rites and belief of other races and other religions and second to respect other peoples religious wishes without those principles being adopted in a school it is difficult to see how a cohesive and tolerant multi cultural society can be built in this country

5610931 your baby s success can only be attributed to the hard work and dedication of the small but incredibly motivated and talented team behind the scenes
5610932 we believe that the best ideas are born in the shower and the most inspired shoots are dreamt up in the wee hours of the morning attending to the needs of a demanding baby but best of all because most of the members of our team are moms themselves we know just what it is our readers are looking for honest heart to heart advice to help them cope with the one of the toughest jobs
5610933 for years he was just missing he just wasnt there anymore his mother never believed he was dead though she always expected him to come home
5610934 in some respects we started searching the day we learned the grunion had not been heard from and was missing
5610935 he was always at sea so i dont know if i ever believed he wasnt coming home as a kid i remember shooting baskets in the driveway i thought if i could get five in a row hed come home
5610936 because its venting properly itll maintain a temperature that will reduce the risk of explosion
5610937 they regained the use of one vent and manually opened a second vent to drastically reduce the threat of explosion
5610938 its coming out of the tank at 260 degrees below zero its very cold so it lays on the ground
5610939 theyre just going under the name of the kaiser chiefs
5610940 i did drugs for 18 years and i never got that bad as to say you know what i think the kaiser chiefs are brilliant
5610941 were definitely not offended but i do actually like it i think its a bit of sport
5610942 it is funny though because it does happen oasis insult another band every single time they put out an album and the last two albums its been us
5610943 when i was 17 and noel was going on about blur i was watching it and now im 30 and hes 50 and hes talking about us its brilliant
5610944 the first thing that he will do when he returns home is to focus on his health since he is fairly old

5610947 i was just 13 when one of my best friends brothers was about to sign a contract with london football team leyton orient
5610948 but one day he was walking the streets saw a fight went over to help got stabbed in the back and was paralysed
5610949 the record industry is a very political place at the moment
5610950 lots of people have been fired or have taken redundancy laid off recently as the company emi was taken over
5610951 many of these people were people assigned to my projects and now i dont quite know whats going on
5610952 im sure everyone will find their feet soon enough and ill be able to put the album out soon
5610953 every man under my command owes me 100 nazi scalps and yall will git get me 100 nazi scalps taken from the heads of 100 dead nazis or die trying
5610954 it is not just the scalping or the carving of swastikas in foreheads or the shooting of a german officers testicles or the slow strangling scene all shown with tarantinos customary love of detail that is likely to upset the german nation and its critics
5610955 it is the whole idea of turning the second world war into a comic book adventure in which not a single german character has redeeming value
5610956 i dont want it to feel like a period film this is a modern in your face movie
5610957 despite rumors to the contrary 30 seconds to mars is not calling it quits we are incredibly happy healthy and very much together here in los angeles recording our new record
5610958 besides this ridiculously overblown lawsuit we are having one of the most inspiring wonderful and exciting times that weve experienced to date
5610959 as you may have heard we are being sued by our former record company for the ridiculously oversized totally unrealistic and pretty silly but slightly clever sum of 30 000 000 insane yea thats what we said too
5610960 your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about 40 million a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more
5610961 miss jolie says she likes john mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse huh arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan

5610965 this being my first match there was some rustiness besides you had two players who know each other inside out it was more of a mind game for i knew what he was going to do and he knew what i was up to so the trick was to out think each other
5610966 every time i took a lead he would catch up with me and it was getting very nagging i also had trouble while standing back as i could not gauge the ball and had most of the time dipping it just in front thats why i could not put top spin and was lobbing it which made it easy for him

5610968 squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5610969 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5610970 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5610971 theres a lack of well paying jobs in the area

5610974 the only way to make money is selling dope on the corner

5610977 education is truly an equalizer i want our youngsters to have that opportunity
5610978 we offer a unique shopping experience to visitors because they can shop from merchants not only who are local but from around the country
5610979 it really is one of the cornerstones of our organization its our major fundraiser but more importantly every member of junior league participates in it its a commitment that we have made as an organization without that commitment it wouldnt be a success
5610980 its a time where you can really get the first look at all that we have to offer
5610981 they can do some shopping have a relaxing evening not have any hustle and bustle and experience shopping like they never did before
5610982 a global problem and it has severe consequences for ecosystems
5610983 we do not have today the infrastructure in north louisiana to take that gas out
5610984 companies are looking hard at rivers and bayous and buying water
5610985 theyre not going to be able to pull all that water from aquifers
5610986 major worldwide airlines are attempting to fill up empty seats
5610987 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5610988 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5610989 it cleans out all the trees and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5610990 every hurricane that we have we have additional lessons learned and experience
5610991 heres a woman thats successful takes care of herself looks amazing and she took the steps to get there it doesnt happen unless you take charge shes a great role model for many many women
5610992 when i was in my 30s 50 just seemed so ancient to me
5610993 i was in high school when she hit it big
5610994 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at madonna as sort of a harbinger of the future for us and the future looks pretty good
5610995 put a picture of a 50 year old woman today next to one from my mothers generation
5610996 we look at least 10 to 15 years younger than they did
5610997 also 50 really is a new beginning for so many women
5610998 many have accomplished a number of their goals already their children are getting older for the first time they can really think about themselves and ask what do i want from life
5610999 as the cliche goes i guess its better than the alternative
5611000 i just dont feel like what 50 should feel like
5611001 i remember my grandmother at 50 her hair was completely white my mother too was just at a very different place in her life than i am now
5611002 shes done a remarkable job of marketing herself and shes always been able to reinvent herself
5611003 our philosophy is to put your best players on special teams
5611004 if a guy gets tired you rest him on offense and defense
5611005 thats the one thing that really irked me about last year
5611006 i spent a lot of time on that i changed up my steps and my follow through im a lot more comfortable kicking this year
5611007 so this will be a big scrimmage for him on wednesday
5611008 i am not questioning the need but i am questioning the procedure in which its done
5611009 by instituting this three year cutback this would allow external agencies a period of time to secure any offsetting funding nonprofit and nongovernmental organizations in our opinion and i say our meaning myself a bunch of people ive spoken to should not be under the umbrella of lcg their tax dollars should not be given to these agencies
5611010 some of these have to be taken by their own merit and largely because of what service they provide
5611011 just to make the determination across the board may be convenient but not necessarily the best way
5611012 all the discussion tonight is real emotional and its all feel good but i believe what mr theriot is trying to say is also extremely accurate we cant just say yes to everything without having some consequences eventually i would like for you guys to consider putting this up and letting them the voters tell us
5611013 many agencies have are and will continue to make a difference
5611014 if you start cutting things then you begin to take away services every single one of them could express their value and their worth to the community people assign a value to things that are worth something to them
5611015 thats a lot of money for drugs ill tell you
5611016 what is occurring now is the inmates are unfortunately placing things in the toilets that shouldnt be in there blankets batteries cups pretty much anything they can get their hands on
5611017 in several instances thats resulted in the jail backing up
5611018 theres an old baseball adage hit em where they aint
5611019 this didnt grow of thinking lets do something different with our noon news
5611020 the retired and the unemployed with a smattering of stay at home moms
5611021 this is an interesting move and my guess is its a positive one
5611022 i love the idea that someones trying something thats a little different trying something at 9 a m makes all the sense in the world
5611023 since the network morning shows have started gaining audience local tv has started adding more programming
5611024 a noon newscast has never been a big moneymaker for stations
5611025 youve got to run in the morning which is the growth spot for tv news and youve got to run in the evening when the audience is largest noon news works into the schedule well which is probably why stations are doing it youve got people sitting around in the newsroom on the clock so why not use them
5611026 largely female stay at home moms who are sitting down for a cup of coffee and want to catch up on whats happening in the world
5611027 there will not be a lot of celebrity news but if renee zellweger wants to come back to baltimore and shoot another movie shes going to be much more willing to appear on a 9 a m newscast that she will at 5 in the morning
5611028 after so much time it has been kind of shocking

5611060 de pijn was op dat moment echt ondraaglijk als ik de wedstrijd had uitgelopen liep ik het risico mijn achillespees onherstelbaar te beschadigen ik kan het gevoel dat op dat moment door me heen ging onmogelijk beschrijven

5611063 het is duidelijk dat het russische optreden buitensporig is het kan niet zo zijn dat de navo nu zou doen alsof er niets aan t handje is maar tegelijk moeten we wel de mogelijkheden tot dialoog met moskou openhouden

5611130 petani juga bisa programkan tanam padi secara serentak mudah mendapatkan benih padi dan harga terjangkau tidak seperti mendatangkan benih padi dari luar daerah seperti sekarang harga sudah jauh lebih mahal juga sering tidak mencukupi kebutuhan petani
5611131 ini dikarenakan daerah lain juga membutuhkan benih padi jadi bersamaan
5611132 tingkat produksi padi di malinau masih rendah rapat rata 3 5 ton per hektare karena itu lahan 10 hektare belum mampu memenuhi kebutuhan benih padi unggul masyarakat tiap tahunnya mencapai 90 ton lebih jadi petani juga diharapkan dapat ikut menyiapkan benih unggul
5611133 pada prinsipnya mereka cukup kagum melihat kondisi kabupaten malinau yang memiliki hutan yang masih virgin dan berharap kepada masyarakat melalui cifor untuk tetap menjaga keutuhan hutan tersebut

5611139 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5611140 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5611141 we just want to make sure its not a problem
5611142 for me the biggest issue is getting the book to the reader and how thats done im happy to leave to the marketing people unless they overstep the mark in this case i feel they really have overstepped the mark
5611143 if they had asked writers and children and parents they would have realised a lot of people are outraged at the prescriptive nature of this scheme
5611144 theres no such thing as an average seven year old they could be four or 10 or like me 65 its just nonsense
5611145 if you say a book is for a seven year old the nine year old is going to be trying to cover it up at the back of the class
5611146 there are so many more important issues they should concentrate on
5611147 the best way to get children to read is to write good books in the first place make sure theyre beautifully illustrated then have libraries open and teachers who love books and parents who love books thats how we improve reading among children
5611148 the interesting thing about childrens books is that its not the readers who are buying them it is parents and grandparents and libraries and schools
5611149 i think thats what the publishers were trying to address as a reader you drop a book if you dont like it so children will self censor but its knowing what to buy them in the first place
5611150 because they enable us to measure our progress since the last meeting to openly acknowledge continuing problems to evaluate the positive and negative new developments

5611173 but while obama has raised a third of a billion dollars his opponents have raised nothing they can either contribute now or pay later if we do not succeed obama will
5611174 we are ramping up for the battle against barack obama
5611175 but there has been one overwhelming and embarrassing failure involving senator obamas opponents the failure of the opposition to raise money to run advertising opposing obamas fantasy ads
5611176 obama has raised a third of a billion dollars to present his point of view
5611177 the stop obama coalition http stopobamacoalition com has organized the committee of one million to defeat barack obama to raise money for advertising to oppose obama
5611178 it is not enough to bellyache about obama as sean hannity does when obama is preparing to flood the united states with deceptive ads in september and october
5611179 i have devoted the profits from my book obama the man behind the mask to the anti obama movement
5611180 frankly i would be happy if the millions of obamas opponents gave to someone
5611181 mccain is accepting public funding for his campaign so he cannot engage in any more fund raising one he is nominated in a few days
5611182 now that mccain is showing he has a chance of winning obama is going to appeal for hundreds of millions of dollars more to drown out mccains message
5611183 we have a massive challenge ahead of us no one who says he opposes obama really oppose obama until he contributes money to his defeat
5611184 the task is not going to be easy unlike obama who is using dirty campaign finance techniques such as illegal contributions fat cats and bundling we have placed strict limits on contributions to the committee of one million if we can raise the money fairly and honestly we will do so if not then people will have to run the risk of four years of barack and michelle obama in the white house there will be no fat cats and bundlers giving money to the committee we want to provide an opportunity for small donors to finance the opposition to obama our maximum donation is 100
5611185 i pray to god we raise enough money to get the message out electing barack obama would be the end of the united states as we know and love it contribute now or pay later

5611309 he has served his sentence and the authorities in vietnam will deport him
5611310 he does not have any sentence to serve in london if he wants to stop wherever he wants to he can do that
5611311 the only problem is the countries he wants to go to because he has to get a visa
5611312 his rich experience in the financial services industry and as a cfo will help take firstsource to the next level
5611313 thats a question that has been bothering me lately too of course im a little bit older than you
5611314 i think were here to learn and to grow and to be nice to one another
5611315 well some people have more to learn than others i guess
5611316 i dunno mom whats the point of trying to learn a whole bunch of stuff if by the time you know it all youre either dead or too old to do anything worth knowing about anyway
5611317 mmmm well you are a thinker thats for sure perhaps the most important thing is to just be a good person i guess thats what god really wants us to do
5611318 uh well um let me think about it im gonna go find kit kat i havent seen him all day you want some water or something
5611319 did you get it from the jungle it looks just like the cat we smashed with a rock doesnt it jimmy
5611320 naaa it looks like the one we drove over maybe it survived and still has more lives left hey how else can we kill a cat
5611321 sit down and have some rat a too eee its very healthy for you
5611322 relax a little kid even if people act mean or seem not to care or you feel all alone youre never really alone there really is a god in this world and youre loved more than you can even begin to imagine
5611323 i am the lord your god who brought you out of egypt
5611324 you shall know this day and understand it in your heart that the almighty is god
5611325 when you stood at mount sinai god asked who will insure that you will always fear god you should have replied almighty you will you should have seized the opportunity to request that god give you fear of heaven
5611326 it is proper for all those who fear god to constantly be in pain and worry over the destruction of the holy temple
5611327 any generation in which the holy temple is not rebuilt is held responsible for its destruction
5611328 if one person does a sincere teshuva return to god then the whole world merits forgiveness
5611329 what are you talking about thats the greatest news weve heard all week lets get the war machine out
5611330 isnt it terrible that africans are starving to death what are you going to do about it
5611331 what can i do about it who am i im only one person i cant do anything about it
5611332 id love to make aliyah to israel but i dont have the money
5611333 what are you talking about thats 52 a year in 10 years ill have 520 what will that do for me
5611334 thats like trying to move a mountain into the sea
5611335 so what does he do he fills one bucket of dirt and then he lies down to go to sleep
5611336 i get paid by the bucket if i make an effort i get paid i cant imagine how im going to move this mountain into the sea but if the almighty said do it i might as well try
5611337 im just a simple man i am not endowed with any measure of talent or intelligence
5611338 its actually quite complicated first i have to select the proper gauge rope and then i have to weave the net in a particular pattern to ensure that it has the proper balance of strength and flexibility
5611339 that too is quite complex there are many factors involved including season of the year time of day type of fish water depth temperature and speed of the current
5611340 you will testify that you didnt study torah because youre just a simple man not endowed with any talent or intelligence but do you think he gave you the brains to be a fisherman but not the brains to learn torah
5611341 i now see how god protected me had i gotten a hotel room they would have taken me too or my horse would have neighed or my rooster would have crowed or the bandits would have found me by my candlelight everything god does is for the good
5611342 negli occhi della gente si vede quello che vedranno non quello che hanno visto

5611344 toglimi il pane se vuoi toglimi laria ma non togliermi il tuo sorriso dura la mia lotta e torno con gli occhi stanchi a volte daver visto la terra che non cambia ma entrando il tuo sorriso sale al cielo cercandomi ed apre per me tutte le porte della vita
5611345 alcuni dicono che la pioggia brutta ma non sanno che permette di girare a testa alta con il viso coperto dalle lacrime
5611346 e credere in te soltanto giurare in te soltanto riporre in te soltanto la mia fede la mia forza il mio orgoglio tutto il mio mondo tutto quel che sogno e tutto quel che spero
5611347 vorrei tornare bambino perch le ginocchia sbucciate fanno meno male di un cuoreinfranto
5611348 sussurra al mondo ci che sei ma urla a te stesso per capirti

5611368 we hope that tube lines and the rmt can resolve this issue without unnecessary strike action
5611369 as far as were concerned two people doing the same job should get the same rate of pay
5611370 they work for different companies but they work for a company that operates on london underground
5611371 we want to reach a resolvent sic to it and we hope that common sense prevails and theres agreement thats satisfactory to the company and our membership
5611372 not all my employees are members of the rmt and we have some people who are qualified to carry out some of the work needed to carry out a safe and reliable service
5611373 the bottom line from our perspective is that the player has a contract which our rules obligate him to respect
5611374 our rules dont recognize a player or his new team being able to buy the way out of an existing contract its not a scenario that our existing rules contemplate or allow
5611375 we should forget emotions and we should start a new life with a transfer agreement in place
5611376 but without such an agreement if somebody will break the moratorium then it will be everybody could take any player and it will not be good for hockey

5611380 i love the fraternity brothers because theyre so young and such a contrasting team
5611381 one takes his time to think things out the other one loves to rush and go at a million miles an hour theres definitely tension between the two of them while theyre making decisions during the race
5611382 they are small we wanted to make sure that there wasnt anything to prevent us from putting that pack underneath the seat in front of us when we got on a plane we didnt want something to happen where we got delayed because of our luggage we thought that would help us go faster
5611383 we did extensive research on what to wear what was lightweight and would help us move the fastest
5611384 i think it was the longest i ever went without wearing a logo on my t shirt if you see me on the street im usually wearing a
5611385 we both tried to do some training along the lines of going down to our little gym but that was pretty much it
5611386 we have an emerging farm so we do a lot of work out there splitting wood and taking care of the horses
5611387 people were a little afraid we were going to pull a borat on them i told them we werent doing borat but what happened there is very very funny its not easy to shoot in places like that because they practically have no television industry
5611388 the teams have no idea how to get from point a to point b there
5611389 they dont know the language its very difficult to get through this country they get so stuck but they find so many fascinating solutions of how to get through everything one of the things the teams do there is go to a real life floating village its insane

5611397 on sunday against villa i was told three minutes prior to kick off that i was playing but i was prepared you have to be even in the warm up for any emergency and that is what happened
5611398 but working with mark hughes i have a lot of confidence and that follows on from having a good loan spell at norwich last season
5611399 i have been doing well during training and all that has been building up to playing in the premier league for city
5611400 of course i enjoyed the experience if not the result but now i am looking forward to the game on wednesday for the under 21s
5611401 you need regular first team football as a player and i am beginning to get that having also had a few chances in the uefa cup games
5611402 now i am looking forward to helping wales qualify for the under 21 finals it helps having such a good relationship with sam vokes up front
5611403 we have a good partnership and we keep in touch off the field

5611406 our thoughts are with all of those involved and their families
5611407 were currently carrying out enquiries into how this crash happened gathering evidence from the scene and speaking to witnesses
5611408 this is likely to take some time given the nature of the incident and the diverse background of those involved
5611409 we have a number of interpreters helping us and our officers are currently liaising with the relevant embassies to keep them fully informed
5611410 at this point id like to take this opportunity to thank all of the responding agencies and alton towers for their support
5611411 our priority later this morning is to examine the bus
5611412 officers from our collision investigation unit will be at the scene along with specialist vehicle examiners from vosa
5611413 once these thorough investigations have been completed the bus will be removed using specialist equipment
5611414 station road in alton will remain closed until the removal operation is safely finished all we can say at this stage is that this is likely to be some time today
5611415 we apologise for any inconvenience this causes to local residents and alton towers visitors and would encourage those planning a trip later today to check the latest travel news or alton towers website
5611416 this team will improve there is no doubt about that
5611417 there is a youthful look about the squad which is refreshing but which can work either way
5611418 in some ways we perhaps lack a little of that experience and guile that you need but we will learn from what happened at villa which was a vast improvement from our game in the uefa cup last week
5611419 anyone paying attention has given up on a half point move
5611420 the reserve bank minutes didnt say anything about the size of cuts
5611421 indeed less restrictive conditions could soon be called for otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase
5611422 on these considerations a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate
5611423 the economists who spend time writing something up are struggling to find something to do
5611424 what has russia demonstrated it has demonstrated that it can use its overwhelming regional military power to beat up on a small neighbor thats what it demonstrated it can attack georgian civilians it can block georgian highways it can bomb georgian ports and it can say very nasty things about a democratically elected georgian government thats what it has demonstrated
5611425 i am going with the satisfaction that whatever i could do for this nation for the people i did it with all my honesty and integrity
5611426 some elements have given preface to their own interests rather than the nation
5611427 they said that during the last nine years our economic problems and electricity shortages were due to our policies it is absolutely wrong and deception for the country
5611428 it was explained to me that because i had been out for four months with injury that the national coach wanted to see me back in action
5611429 the fact that i am in the under 21s will not affect my game and i aim to make sure it will not be long before i am in the senior squad hopefully i will be back with the big boys again very soon
5611430 there are a lot of good players available to the england manager but if he had been at villa he would have seen an outstanding performance from micah
5611431 at the end of the day who mr capello picks is his concern and mine is just that micah comes back from international duty fit and well and ready to go next week
5611432 i thought he led from the front and stuck at it well
5611433 he is an organiser and manages to harnesses his athletic ability with a great desire so he could become a real leader

5611444 its frustrating because yeah im at a point when my career is not anywhere near the end
5611445 its frustrating because we as a team have worked so hard to see softball grow to be a recognized sport and to be on tv a lot
5611446 why were we trying to make these strides if its not going to be recognized by everybody
5611447 if you look at the growth of our sport especially in the united states theres a reason for it and a lot of it has been the influx of the cat ostermans and the jennie finches and the mendozas that have really been tremendous role models
5611448 internationally probably they may not have the opportunity to be quite as known as a lisa fernandez but softball people know that these are pretty special athletes that really have done a great job in the window that theyve had to play the game
5611449 we think this years high earnings growth will not be sustainable into next year
5611450 next year the banks may face higher credit costs and that may lower earnings growth
5611451 the positive earnings revision cycle over the past 12 months looks to be ending as nims credit risks are rising as chinas economy faces potentially greater than expected slowdown risks
5611452 the odd bit of profit taking maybe but i think the stakes theyve got are quite unique and they wouldnt be in a rush to sell unless they were really financially stretched

5611478 the ajc has long appreciated the importance of azerbaijan as an example of religious tolerance and a proven friend of the united states and israel
5611479 we valued this opportunity to learn more about this strong ally in a challenging and critical region we look forward to sharing our views about azerbaijans key role when we return to the united states
5611480 azerbaijan is critical to western energy security and to the avoidance of a potentially dangerous monopoly in the market for natural gas
5611481 the nagorno karabakh conflict was the key issue of discussion during my visit to baku we will work to improve the osce minsk groups mission in the settlement of the conflict
5611482 azerbaijans armament now has many wondering if baku is planning another conflict against a neighbor that has been cut out of the regions recent energy wealth
5611483 azerbaijan has grown stronger and richer following the 2006 completion of the baku tbilisi ceyhan btc oil pipeline which western companies developed to feed oil to europe
5611484 the btc led to a more pro western azerbaijan and the tremendous new wealth it generated has helped the country increase its defense spending from 175 million in 2004 to more than 1 billion at the start of 2008
5611485 the country is arming itself and neighboring armenia is closely watching the two countries have been deadlocked over the azerbaijani secessionist region of nagorno karabakh a conflict that has flared into a war in the past azerbaijans armament now has many wondering if baku is planning another conflict against a neighbor that has been cut out of the regions recent energy wealth
5611486 american taxpayers are being asked to help cover hundreds of million of dollars in increased costs for the btc pipeline route that would bypass the more economic and commercially viable route through armenia if the caucasus regionsin my opinionsis to move forwardswe must ensure that all countries move forward together at the same time choosing favorites in the caucasus will not promote regional stabilityseconomic integrationsand peace
5611487 as your friends we will try to do something for this but it mostly depends on azerbaijan itself americans shouldnt only know azerbaijan as an energy rich country but also as a country that made important contributions to peacekeeping efforts in iraq and afghanistan
5611488 we will work to improve the relations between the united states and azerbaijan
5611489 we will also pay attention to americans education of azerbaijan to convey to them the basic knowledge about azerbaijan and to inform the political circles and u s presidential contenders about azerbaijan
5611490 turkey has to maintain its embargo against armenia for that
5611491 otherwise azerbaijan has no other option but to liberate its lands through military force
5611492 im very hopeful we will be able to come out with an amenable solution for everybody
5611493 shes never attacked a person shes never bitten a person
5611494 given the current financing environment we are skeptical that a sale of the company is likely
5611495 instead the focus is likely to shift to the fundamentals and managements challenge will be creating a product mix that can grow faster than the anemic 3 per cent we saw in the second quarter

5611497 if mr david braley brought in a consultant it would make me quite annoyed
5611498 the way im looking at it right now is the time im not in there im not getting any bruises
5611499 if today or tomorrow is my last day in the cfl i go back to what i was doing before i was in the cfl when i started my dogtag business i actually dont even think about it why waste my energy
5611500 im looking at it one week at a time this week his days arent numbered next week i might have to look at things differently the unfortunate part of all this is that a change had to be made
5611501 before the war nobody was interested in coming to our department
5611502 now infrastructure is the first priority of our government people want to come learn
5611503 one day in afghanistan we will have it like this
5611504 you cant just go through and chop the mountain down
5611505 absent any further appeals we expect the restructuring to close by sept 30 2008
5611506 it is a fair expectation that somebody is going to apply for leave to appeal
5611507 its an issue of national importance which is the primary ground the supreme court of canada looks to and they also look to the issue of whether theres a conflict at the appellate level which we clearly have in this case
5611508 all were doing is getting ready as soon as we reasonably can to close this transaction we dont know whether there will be an appeal or not if there is an appeal we will deal with it
5611509 on the other hand we have a lot of clients that need their money so well do the best we can to move this forward as fast as possible
5611510 people who sold the paper to the potential appellants to do whatever they can to arrive at a reasonable settlement with them
5611511 the reality is that some of them the upset investors are damn lucky they didnt win the appeal here because they begin to realize theyd be a hell of a lot better off with the restructured paper
5611512 in a very very small minority of cases in which its asked for in this case you have two decisions of the ontario court approving the plan and a very strong decision from the court of appeal today
5611513 i was extremely relieved to hear that the ontario court of appeal not only dismissed the appeal but did so in a unanimous way
5611514 i think were done here and should be moving forward
5611515 lets just drive on and dont hold us hostage any more
5611516 while the notion of releases in favour of third parties including leading canadian financial institutions that extend to claims of fraud is distasteful there is no legal impediment
5611517 mortgages rising at 13 per cent a year is totally inconsistent with what were seeing in the economy
5611518 when the economy is slowing and credit is accelerating something is wrong here something is not good
5611519 this wealth position has been a mental driver of consumer strength over the past couple of years
5611520 weve found thats an effective way to get the message out
5611521 kick start a revolution in wireless technology including universal wireless online access and numerous new products and services that cant even be imagined today
5611522 uns geht es um die von beiden institutionen erfolgreich gelehrte innovationsmethode des design thinking durch gemeinsame wissenschaftliche forschungsprojekte wollen wir herausfinden welche faktoren diese art des ingenieurartigen und kreativen entwickelns von innovationen f r alle lebensbereiche letztlich so erfolgreich machen

5611524 die ganz gro en spr nge wird es nicht mehr geben
5611525 we want to see how frequent this occurs what steps might be taken do all judges approach this in the same way those kinds of things
5611526 obviously what needs to prevail here is the safety of the child
5611527 the earlier a patient receives it the better chance they have at having a better quality of life
5611528 simon has seen his health improve significantly since being on enzyme replacement therapy
5611529 this is how universal health care is supposed to work
5611530 once the trial is up the plug gets pulled unless the government steps up
5611531 the idea is to get energy relief money as well as the permanent fund dividend before winter hits so people have their money to offset the astronomical costs we are seeing for energy
5611532 per aiutare le misure coercitive contro il disboscamento illegale dellamazzonia adottate dal governo questanno
5611533 we know players want pet simulation games with a variety of animals to choose from and animal paradise delivers just that with loads of adorable animals engaging gameplay and appeal for children and animal lovers of all ages
5611534 we think this is a perfect title to kick off our distribution deal with atari and another step forward in establishing empire as a major player in the us gaming market
5611535 hij kan rekenen op een andere vorm van steun vanwege de minister
5611536 i think other municipalities will be very encouraged by londons leadership
5611537 already many are looking at this issue and im sure many others will
5611538 to us its a matter of choice and a matter of personal preference
5611539 bottled water companies have had a fabulous ride on an unnecessary fad
5611540 it would be virtually impossible to ensure everyone has access to water
5611541 i think theyre going to be olympic champions for sure
5611542 were trying to be on the good side of that stat we know we have something special so when times are tough we try to hang onto that in the back of our minds
5611543 the wheels come off when you start to argue you know theres no point in arguing you stop you figure it out you talk about it and maybe you slow things down a little bit
5611544 you talk about it instead of turning your back on your teammate
5611545 but then in transport something changed understandably with the accident whether or not he went unconscious on them i dont know as time went by it became evident that he was injured more so than originally thought
5611546 we do not know what status he was in when the plane had its mishap whether he was in takeoff or landing
5611547 from what we can gather at this point hes an experienced pilot
5611548 but mr hussey loved flying he must have to go out alone
5611549 the whole years before that i thought it was normal
5611550 thats the rules and you have to play by them
5611551 he was quiet calm collected a real thinker and not a risk taker
5611552 today were doing a more intense search than sunday turning over every inch
5611553 he has the skills and ability to take care of himself out there
5611554 hes heavily involved in the community both he and his wife
5611555 as far as edwin getting lost in the area its hard to believe
5611556 he knew his land so well knew every tree on his property unless something overtook him physically or mentally he wouldnt be lost
5611557 from the day of my installation meeting people in their own communities has been a priority for me
5611558 hosting a garden party outside of the halifax region seemed like the next step in making the office of the lieutenant governor accessible to as many nova scotians as possible
5611559 what this report says to me is people are becoming educated
5611560 in the past its always been that if you got a mental illness you were basically doomed to an asylum
5611561 but thats no longer the case people are starting to recognize that
5611562 this years report card shines a harsh and frankly unflattering light on the attitudes we canadians have concerning mental health
5611563 in some ways mental illness is the final frontier of socially acceptable discrimination
5611564 can you imagine the public uproar if mental health was replaced with race gender or religion
5611565 these figures show clearly the insidious stigma still associated with mental health and mental illness
5611566 these are the attitudes that have kept mental health on the outside for far too long
5611567 i want to make a difference and put a smile on the kids faces
5611568 were just giving kids from nova scotia an experience that they never would have in a classroom
5611569 we know the basics like hello and goodbye but we couldnt hold a conversation
5611570 i came to the birds nest to lay a golden egg and thats what i did
5611571 its an awesome feeling i knew i had the potential for a medal at these games
5611572 im just happy my first throw was the gold medal throw
5611573 its an awesome feeling i knew i was going to medal then i got the gold medal
5611574 i knew i had to throw well i had to step it up
5611575 i had a mary lou retton leotard i wore all the time
5611576 i grew out of it quickly i was 6 feet by the time i got to junior high school i was not going to be a gymnast
5611577 i hope i can continue to progress and continue to improve hopefully ill get stronger and faster
5611578 driving 100 miles to buy my clothes with gas prices these days its incredible
5611579 i wish i knew how to sew being a woman and 6 4 up until i was in fifth grade i hunched my shoulders when i got to junior high the coaches wanted me on the basketball team
5611580 if there was a hunting trip if he could hunt wild pigs in china he would be here
5611581 he even has a valid passport no one in my family has a valid passport traveling to china was not the highest priority
5611582 the preseason is important but i think the idea is to be ready for when the regular season kicks off
5611583 your site is amazing i love photography too hopefully i can learn a thing or two from you
5611584 you are an excellent professional and your blog is very special with great photos a hug from brazil
5611585 i dont understand your language but the photographs of your blog are very nice
5611586 you take beautiful photos i really enjoyed visiting your site thanks for sharing it with me
5611587 thanks for dropping by keep up with those great shots
5611588 i like to hit but i think since ive been here the more i hit the worse ive been getting
5611589 i guess theyre going to hitch their wagon to him and just ride him off into the sunset
5611590 i was just looking for something out over the plate trying to put a good swing on it put it in play
5611591 he threw me a curveball and i was able to flip it to left
5611592 it was a little awkward but i was just trying to get in scoring position
5611593 i dont think my mind set has changed any since april
5611594 more consistent pound the zone if you can show guys youre ahead in the zone theyre going to swing at pitches early in the count that arent necessarily good pitches to hit i was able to do that tonight
5611595 as a coach i look at this roster we have landon donovan and david beckham as a starting point thats fabulous
5611596 i think we have a good group of players to join in and make this a good team
5611597 her win was a very romantic kentucky derby win and i dont think the fans ever forgot her
5611598 i think the political leaders have no excuse now they have to address the immediate issues like inflation and the long term structural problems of pakistani polity they cant use musharraf as an excuse any more
5611599 it is a change about the democratic spirit and transition and the establishment of constitutionality
5611600 it is now really a test of their ability and a test of their capacity to deliver
5611601 this led to paralysis during which little was achieved and the economy faltered
5611602 now we can expect more normal politics politics are inherently competitive but the ruling coalition partners are likely to stay together for a while
5611603 theres a difference between nitrogen species going into the leaves and that process being useful
5611604 if plants really can use the by product organic nitrates then this will ultimately help to remove nox from the atmosphere
5611605 the process would be an efficient way to transport nitrogen away from polluted areas
5611606 there are always consequences in what you do if you think that attacking them would be positive what do you gain it is the second biggest economy in the world and in 50 years it will be the biggest economy suddenly you break the bridge it would be so easy to be there at the olympics
5611607 last meeting i went to there was 300 people and most of them were canadian you know they have a collective memory there that is very important
5611608 we are at the bottom of the ladder in terms of having any influence with china ask any businessman who has been to china and he will tell you the same thing
5611609 but for them the chinese the dalai lama is not a religious leader
5611610 protester contre les prix pratiqu s dans la grande distribution et faire acte de solidarit entre producteurs et consommateurs

5611612 i dont think missteps of the past should haunt him i think he understands the gravity of the situation he realizes how the insurgency can destabilize he needs to be listened to he is there now you cant walk around him
5611613 even with a civilian government in control of pakistans parliament washington will continue to concentrate its antiterrorism efforts on gen kayani the army chief of staff who succeeded musharraf as military chief last november
5611614 when you compare the faces and head shapes of children with specific types of autism to other children it is obvious there are variations
5611615 currently autism diagnosis is purely behaviour based and doctors use tape measurements to check for facial and brain dissimilarities
5611616 we are developing a quantitative method that will accurately measure these differences and allow for earlier more precise detection of specific types of the disorder
5611617 once we have created a formula we can pre screen children by performing a quick non invasive scan of each childs face and brain to check for abnormalities early detection is crucial in treating children and preparing families
5611618 instead of looking at brain structures slice by slice in an mri magnetic resonance image we developed tools to create 3 d representations of the structures in order to visualize and make comparisons
5611619 using the 3 d representations we are comparing the brain structures of autistic children to those of non autistic children no one has ever done that
5611620 our research group is exploiting a tremendous overlap of knowledge from many disciplines yes work will be a pivotal part of anrgs grand scheme to solve these problems it takes an entire community of specialists working together
5611621 cerebral malaria is lethal 20 percent of the time in the best of hands and here weve shown that something as simple as aspirin because of its affect on platelets might be able to improve the outcomes of those who contract this deadly form of the disease
5611622 our mouse studies show that timing is critical with the mice we know when we infected them and controlled when we treated them a big challenge in translating this to humans is that people dont know when they get infected
5611623 by taking what we know about platelets and their activation and applying it to malaria we have found a driver of cerebral malaria
5611624 a prior or existing relationship formed by a voluntary two way communication between a person or entity and a residential subscriber with or without an exchange of consideration on the basis of an inquiry application purchase or transaction by the residential subscriber regarding products or services offered by such person or entity which relationship has not been previously terminated by either party

5611629 all i will say is that my client maintains his innocence
5611630 we were informed this morning of the news from antigua and we are pleased at how the investigation is progressing
5611631 we are not going to make any further comment at this time and we would ask that the media continues to respect our privacy
5611632 sind sie es leid immer wie ein kleiner fisch behandelt zu werden
5611633 this study will potentially demonstrate that it is the regimen of administration of birth control pills rather than their specific formulation that results in successful treatment of pmdd
5611634 if we can eliminate the hormone cycling we should eliminate the pmdd symptoms
5611635 theyre regulators of mood and emotion so if you can eliminate the metabolites that have been implicated in pmdd you may create a huge benefit for women with pmdd
5611636 we believe this trial will help us understand the underlying physiology which will allow for the development of a range of possible new treatments

5611647 to have a stellar aviation brand like british airways select shannon as the stop over airport for this exclusive service is a real vote of confidence in the future of shannon airport
5611648 shannon has a long history as a transatlantic gateway having been irelands designated transatlantic airport as far back as the 1930s and we hope this new arrangement with british airways is the start of a long and successful relationship
5611649 british airways has not operated any service out of shannon since the early 1990s and we are delighted to have them back doing business with us

5611666 when he opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of god and the testimony they had maintained they called out in a loud voice how long sovereign lord holy and true until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood then each of them was given a white robe and they were told to wait a little longer until the full number of their fellow servants and brothers and sisters were killed just as they had been
5611667 it is a victory of democratic forces today the shadow of dictatorship that has prevailed for long over this country that chapter has been closed

5611678 developer of global healthcare standards health level seven has announced the release of version 3 normative edition 2008 a globally defined suite of specifications based on hl7s reference information model
5611679 adam bosworth made quite a name for himself in the healthcare space while he was leader of the google health initiative all got quite strange however when while on vacation late last summer bosworth decided not to return to google health and while bosworth went into stealth mode to develop keas google chose not to replace him a mistake and google health fell under the tutelage of marissa mayer
5611680 i made a dispassionate military style analysis of our options weighing pros and cons
5611681 musharraf never was able to fully deliver on his promises
5611682 our dilemma throughout much of the muslim world is that in the interest of security we tend to align ourselves with strongmen who meet our short term needs but not our long term interests
5611683 one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5611684 the bottom line is that the top leadership of al qaeda has not only eluded capture they have thrived
5611685 musharraf was careful to give only selective support to the united states
5611686 i think the war against terror will in fact be pursued with a lot more vigour and a lot less political manipulation

5611707 in every diaper there is a fine copper wire when that becomes wet a delicate current is sent you understand i mean an electrical current not a watery one to an amplifier and a certain sound is made and the nurse will properly react to that sound
5611708 i got home and immediately knew it wasnt gluten free
5611709 my friend barely made it out of the parking lot
5611710 i have seen a horrific world unfold and only play that we catch it before it spills into total famine and all out war do you know about the famine going on world wide in the poor countries
5611711 our number one priority is a management change so we can get back on track and revisit some of the tragedies of the past
5611712 thats an excuse for someone who cant get it done now
5611713 the goal is to create a sustainable economy for scottsdale and south scottsdale
5611714 i live a quarter mile from where they would start the power lines
5611715 its going to affect all the views that we have and they are going to affect all the values of the homes
5611716 i can tell you that citizens in my district are concerned and very angered that aps has taken the stand it has
5611717 this is the first time peoria has appeared before the committee to argue for a different route than aps preferred
5611718 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5611719 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5611720 furthermore by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5611721 i would say thats not something that student government really works on
5611722 i pledge that i will serve faithfully in the civil air patrol cadet program and that i will attend meetings regularly participate actively in unit activities obey my officers wear my uniform properly and advance my education and training rapidly to prepare myself to be of service to my community state and nation
5611723 im an avid backpacker so i wanted to know what to do in emergencies
5611724 thats the main thing that got me involved in this
5611725 one of the things i find pretty unique is it places a lot of responsibility on pretty young cadets
5611726 this program adds an element of discipline that you cant get anywhere else
5611727 hopefully it will help the people who run charter schools to take a step back and determine if they have these elements in their schools and if not try to bring them into their schools
5611728 if it helps people rededicate themselves to why they got into the charter business in the first place hopefully to make a difference for the students education then this report will do it
5611729 we are happy to receive recognition but happier to hear one of our children was the number 1 student in norths north high schools international baccalaureate program and is getting into cornell
5611730 were working on how we can take what we learned and implement it for every single kid in every single charter school
5611731 charter schools in arizona can be a critical part of that revival
5611732 my first reaction is i was disappointed that his suicide was taking the culmination of the investigation out of our hands
5611733 if in fact dr ivins had been indicted we would have gone to court the defense attorneys would have decided whether the scientific analysis was sufficient now we dont get that chance
5611734 the process was painstakingly detailed and every step of the way we made sure we could defend that step in court
5611735 we were very very worried about that so we were being very very careful
5611736 the total case is something that really only a jury could decide
5611737 theyre looking for people that may be up trees or on cliffs
5611738 we couldnt see anything we could just hear how strong the water was it was shaking the canyon
5611739 everybody was shouting weve got to get to higher ground
5611740 what we now know is they didnt make it out and they were hanging in trees and on picnic tables
5611741 they were there all night until the helicopters got them in the morning
5611742 i got terrified and decided to leave my job and just come up
5611743 these are not citizen initiatives anymore these are paid circulators
5611744 my hope is this will not impact on what is a long held and cherished initiative process
5611745 when you put this much money out there on the street no one has control over these independent contractors
5611746 hated to lose just as much at 10 as he does now
5611747 unfortunately there are some folks who will lose their jobs
5611748 that can be an advantage but if it were self evident it would have already been done the question is how well will this work
5611749 we still have to ask them if they are willing since it may contain sensitive or proprietary information
5611750 i think everyone recognizes the need for urgent care in pasadena and there are very few options available
5611751 the health department conducted a strategic planning process a couple of years ago throughout pasadena interviewing 1 000 individuals residents nonprofits and health care providers and access to health care and urgent care was one of the top priorities
5611752 but a lot of variables go into that becoming a reality
5611753 the developers have yet to submit an application and i have no idea what they are experiencing in todays financing market
5611754 its understandable people want to see it preserved as a health care entity
5611755 but we havent done any formal assessments we would really need to speak to the developer and still a lot of evaluation and analysis would have to go forward if were looking at a viable option
5611756 some people think its the same as an er open 24 hours seven days a week
5611757 to the mall the playground playdates to target just to go somewhere
5611758 if youre a stay at home mother youd better have a darned good reason to go somewhere you wonder where can i stop by on my way home from another errand
5611759 we just dont have as much money as we used to
5611760 i was famous for running here and there to get ingredients
5611761 if i was missing something id run out and get it i dont do that anymore i sit down and plan meals two weeks ahead then buy everything at once
5611762 ive always wanted to be a stay at home mom
5611763 if your supposition is that the prospects arent good anyway
5611764 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties
5611765 we are not staying home with our children by default
5611766 stay at home moms are very good at being frugal
5611767 often theyre the ones in charge of household finances but when youre worried that the one paycheck wont come its that much more frightening
5611768 there are times when i think if i were back at work i could afford this or that
5611769 but i dont think it would pan out in the end
5611770 we had a date night for a while once a week but it petered out
5611771 maybe it was my birthday in may last year not this year
5611772 to find a job that pays something decent i would still have to drive an hour each way at 4 30 a gallon
5611773 i go to five places in one day with three kids its horrible
5611774 how can we justify eating out when we could go to a store and buy enough for a couple days worth of meals
5611775 theres just no time to regroup none left for ourselves
5611776 irelands economic boom has made us complacent the global economy is changing dramatically and we are falling behind
5611777 with less money available and greater competition for foreign direct investment globally every aspect of irelands offering will be scrutinised in detail and where ireland is seen to be lacking the country will lose out on foreign investment in the coming years
5611778 the downward trend in the numbers of students that are taking up these disciplines is very worrying because a skills shortage makes it harder to justify new investments here the government needs to demonstrate that it takes this seriously and must show more leadership and commitment to making these subjects attractive to students it is a national imperative that we invest in our education system
5611779 despite the current downturn we still see notable job opportunities in pharmaceuticals medical devices environmental engineering as well as demand for process and project engineers but if we dont get more engineers the green agenda for example will take longer to implement

5611827 its all about choice if a woman or a father for that matter makes a choice to take a backward step in their career for a child then thats a matter of choice
5611828 but when its not their choice when the prejudice in the workplace makes that choice for them its a completely different matter
5611829 everyone acknowledges that theres been a decline in birth rate
5611830 that sort of long term issue isnt going to be addressed if were placing rigidities and barriers in place to people who want to have a career and family
5611831 a six to 12 month paid maternity leave scheme is not a radical proposition when you consider sweden the uk denmark and canada are already at this level or above and we believe this should be the starting point for discussion
5611832 if the largest employer in the country cant have flexible work arrangements that enable people to balance careers and families then theres no hope anywhere
5611833 and in my view the public sector is in many instances ahead of the private sector so if you did the same sort of analysis in the private sector youd find even greater disparities

5611854 zimbabwes annual rate of inflation surged in june to 11 2 million percent
5611855 it gained 9 035 045 5 percentage points from the may rate of 2 233 713 4 percent
5611856 zimbabweans must realise that the country is in a practically binding state of socio economic emergency
5611857 as such there is need for a universal moratorium on all incomes and prices for a minimum period of six months
5611858 zimbabwes annual rate of inflation surged in june to 11 2 million percent
5611859 that particular poll in no small way reflects the enormous amount of respect and regard in this country for the job that mr costello did as treasurer
5611860 it is also a pretty stark reminder how significantly it changed under the very nervous man that is wayne swan our treasurer and indeed prime minister kevin rudd
5611861 i can assure you i am very determined and i will lead us to the next election
5611862 it will take a while before they voters reach the point of deciding when they have had enough defects disappointments and breakdowns before they decide that maybe in hindsight that they didnt do the right thing
5611863 if you have got a small business overdraft a mortgage a credit card you are trying to put petrol in your car you want the government to succeed
5611864 we had a six per cent swing against mr rudd the biggest swing since the first by election in the whitlam government
5611865 i am not actually that interested in an indulgent exercise about who is going to be leader of the liberal party or who isnt we have a leader he is doing a good job
5611866 when i am walking across the street and chatting to people they are not talking to me about liberal party leadership
5611867 they are talking to me about the leadership of the australian economy and about the policy decisions that are being taken
5611868 it is a government that is more concerned about posing in different positions than it is on about taking some really tough decisions
5611869 the fact that drought assistance has been extended in 32 areas shows that farmers continue to struggle with the drought in many parts of the country despite recent rainfall in certain areas
5611870 we have heard about suicide bombers on foot they are receiving indirect fire
5611871 our commando units were deployed into the area and engaged the attackers and pushed them back
5611872 so far 13 attackers have been killed six blew themselves up six others died in the explosions and one died in gunfire from commandos their bodies have been recovered
5611873 thirteen suicide bombers were killed in kijran area of ali sher district
5611874 they were fired at we have found six bodies which were all wearing suicide vests
5611875 some of them have blown themselves up others are hiding in nearby houses and corn fields the troops are searching for them
5611876 nigels always had a great empathy for his teammates and he knows the game hes got a great empathy for the game
5611877 i believe he understands the game too more than most players
5611878 nigel im sure has never thought of any possibility that he would go on and be a coach of any shape or form but now the playing door has closed well then you open your life up to possibilities and thats obviously one of the distinct possibilities
5611879 but when you get to the end its sort of hard to walk away from something thats been a really big part of your life
5611880 theres a lot of options in different places where myself and my family can go weve just got to try and work out which ones the best one for us
5611881 its hard not to live in the moment and for me at the moment i havent been able to get what i want out of footy
5611882 so at the moment im sort of frustrated by what has happened this year
5611883 but my career as a whole has been really successful
5611884 i was waking up and not really looking forward to playing footy as i had in previous years and you just get the feeling it is time
5611885 id like to finish the job i started so long ago 15 years
5611886 it does go really quickly but id like to be here right to the end
5611887 it may be biased to view the deal as going against nuclear non proliferation efforts
5611888 for example the issue of global warming has been getting serious in recent years and co2 emissions from emerging nations such as china and india are becoming a problem
5611889 it is important that india proceeds with nuclear power generation as clean energy
5611890 japan which has suffered atomic bomb attacks should take the initiative in blocking the deal
5611891 it would be a pity if japan only follows us policy irrespective of what is just
5611892 india needs to join the npt first if it wants civilian use of nuclear energy
5611893 if this kind of exception is approved that means that the international community accepts india as a nuclear power that would shake the nonproliferation regime under the npt
5611894 whoever discovers the interpretation of these sayings will not taste death
5611895 those who seek should not stop seeking until they find
5611896 if your leaders say to you look the fathers imperial rule is in the sky then the birds of the sky will precede you 2 if they say to you it is in the sea then the fish will precede you 3 rather the fathers imperial rule is inside you and outside you 4 when you know yourselves then you will be known and you will understand that you are children of the living father 5 but if you do not know yourselves then you live in poverty and you are the poverty
5611897 the person old in days wont hesitate to ask a little child seven days old about the place of life and that person will live 2 for many of the first will be last 3 and will become a single one
5611898 know what is in front of your face and what is hidden from you will be disclosed to you 2 for there is nothing hidden that wont be revealed
5611899 do you want us to fast how should we pray should we give to charity what diet should we observe
5611900 dont lie 3 and dont do what you hate 4 because all things are disclosed before heaven 5after all there is nothing hidden that wont be revealed 6 and there is nothing covered up that will remain undisclosed
5611901 lucky is the lion that the human will eat so that the lion becomes human 2 and foul is the human that the lion will eat and the lion still will become human
5611902 the human one is like a wise fisherman who cast his net into the sea and drew it up from the sea full of little fish 2 among them the wise fisherman discovered a fine large fish 3 he threw all the little fish back into the sea and easily chose the large fish 4 anyone here with two good ears had better listen
5611903 i have cast fire upon the world and look im guarding it until it blazes
5611904 this heaven will pass away and the one above it will pass away 2 the dead are not alive and the living will not die 3 during the days when you ate what is dead you made it come alive when you are in the light what will you do 4 0n the day when you were one you became two but when you become two what will you do
5611905 we know that you are going to leave us who will be our leader
5611906 no matter where you are you are to go to james the just for whose sake heaven and earth came into being
5611907 compare me to something and tell me what i am like
5611908 teacher my mouth is utterly unable to say what you are like
5611909 i am not your teacher because you have drunk you have become intoxicated from the bubbling spring that i have tended
5611910 if i tell you one of the sayings he spoke to me you will pick up rocks and stone me and fire will come from the rocks and devour you
5611911 if you fast you will bring sin upon yourselves 2 and if you pray you will be condemned 3 and if you give to charity you will harm your spirits 4 when you go into any region and walk about in the countryside when people take you in eat what they serve you and heal the sick among them 5 after all what goes into your mouth wont defile you what comes out of your mouth will
5611912 when you see one who was not born of woman fall on your faces and worship that one is your father
5611913 perhaps people think that i have come to cast peace upon the world
5611914 i will give you what no eye has seen what no ear has heard what no hand has touched what has not arisen in the human heart
5611915 have you found the beginning then that you are looking for the end you see the end will be where the beginning is 3 congratulations to the one who stands at the beginning that one will know the end and will not taste death
5611916 congratulations to the one who came into being before coming into being 2 if you become my disciples and pay attention to my sayings these stones will serve you 3 for there are five trees in paradise for you they do not change summer or winter and their leaves do not fall 4 whoever knows them will not taste death
5611917 these nursing babies are like those who enter the fathers domain
5611918 when you make the two into one and when you make the inner like the outer and the outer like the inner and the upper like the lower 5 and when you make male and female into a single one so that the male will not be male nor the female be female 6 when you make eyes in place of an eye a hand in place of a hand a foot in place of a foot an image in place of an image 7 then you will enter the fathers domain
5611919 i shall choose you one from a thousand and two from ten thousand 2 and they will stand as a single one
5611920 show us the place where you are for we must seek it
5611921 anyone here with two ears had better listen 3 there is light within a person of light and it shines on the whole world if it does not shine it is dark
5611922 love your friends like your own soul 2 protect them like the pupil of your eye
5611923 you see the sliver in your friends eye but you dont see the timber in your own eye
5611924 if you do not fast from the world you will not find the fathers domain 2 if you do not observe the sabbath day as a sabbath day you will not see the father
5611925 i took my stand in the midst of the world and in flesh i appeared to them 2 i found them all drunk and i did not find any of them thirsty 3 my soul ached for the children of humanity because they are blind in their hearts and do not see for they came into the world empty and they also seek to depart from the world empty but meanwhile they are drunk when they shake off their wine then they will change their ways
5611926 if the flesh came into being because of spirit that is a marvel 2 but if spirit came into being because of the body that is a marvel of marvels 3 yet i marvel at how this great wealth has come to dwell in this poverty
5611927 where there are three deities they are divine 2where there are two or one i am with that one
5611928 a city built on a high hill and fortified cannot fall nor can it be hidden
5611929 what you will hear in your ear in the other ear proclaim from your rooftops 2 after all no one lights a lamp and puts it under a basket nor does one put it in a hidden place rather one puts it on a lampstand so that all who come and go will see its light
5611930 if a blind person leads a blind person both of them will fall into a hole
5611931 one cant enter a strong mans house and take it by force without tying his hands 36
5611932 dont fret from morning to evening and from evening to morning about what youre going to wear
5611933 when will you appear to us and when will we see you
5611934 when you strip without being ashamed and you take your clothes and put them under your feet like little children and trample them 3 then you will see the son of the living one and you will not be afraid
5611935 often you have desired to hear these sayings that i am speaking to you and you have no one else from whom to hear them 2 there will be days when you will seek me and you will not find me
5611936 the pharisees and the scholars have taken the keys of knowledge and have hidden them 2 they have not entered nor have they allowed those who want to enter to do so 3 as for you be as sly as snakes and as simple as doves
5611937 a grapevine has been planted apart from the father 2 since it is not strong it will be pulled up by its root and will perish

5611941 grapes are not harvested from thorn trees nor are figs gathered from thistles for they yield no fruit 2 good persons produce good from what theyve stored up 3 bad persons produce evil from the wickedness theyve stored up in their hearts and say evil things for from the overflow of the heart they produce evil

5611981 there are many standing at the door but those who are alone will enter the bridal suite
5611982 i am the light that is over all things i am all from me all came forth and to me all attained 2 split a piece of wood i am there 3 lift up the stone and you will find me there
5611983 why have you come out to the countryside to see a reed shaken by the wind 2 and to see a person dressed in soft clothes like your rulers and your powerful ones 3 they are dressed in soft clothes and they cannot understand truth
5611984 lucky are the womb that bore you and the breasts that fed you
5611985 lucky are those who have heard the word of the father and have truly kept it
5611986 whoever has come to know the world has discovered the body 2 and whoever has discovered the body of that one the world is not worthy
5611987 the one who has become wealthy should reign 2 and the one who has power should renounce it
5611988 whoever is near me is near the fire 2 and whoever is far from me is far from the fathers domain
5611989 images are visible to people but the light within them is hidden in the image of the fathers light 2 he will be disclosed but his image is hidden by his light
5611990 when you see your likeness you are happy 2 but when you see your images that came into being before you and that neither die nor become visible how much you will have to bear
5611991 adam came from great power and great wealth but he was not worthy of you 2 for had he been worthy he would not have tasted death
5611992 foxes have their dens and birds have their nests 2 but human beings have no place to lie down and rest
5611993 how miserable is the body that depends on a body 2 and how miserable is the soul that depends on these two
5611994 the messengers and the prophets will come to you and give you what belongs to you

5612020 this was largely in the context of deepening defence cooperation but more so in the process of integration
5612021 for example kenya has aircraft maintenance facilities why then should we rwanda take our planes to europe
5612022 a roadside bomb occured as the ethiopians were walking and at maka almukarramah street
5612023 they opened fire indiscriminately after the explosion but it caused no human causalities
5612024 we dont know who planted it the ethiopians entered a neighbourhood near where the explosion occured but they didnt arrested no people
5612025 we are unified with the fighting of the somali peoples foes
5612026 we have elected aweys as the head of the alliance for the re liberation of somalia ars
5612027 the appointment of the new leaders will enhance the liberation of somalia from the occupation of ethiopia and the puppets proclaimed by addis ababa
5612028 this is very extraordinary for the fbi and the department of justice to discuss a case that has not gone through due process
5612029 obviously for us the science is strong enough that were disclosing it to you today
5612030 because of their admitted mishandling of evidence they are accusing him
5612031 just as soon as i got excited about it i thought that anything as fun cool as this must be illegal
5612032 muxtape will be unavailable for a brief period while we sort out a problem with the riaa

5612039 theres a new star wars movie and no one cares
5612040 warning if you click through the link there will be language that the times frowns upon
5612041 es tut mir sehr sehr leid so viele menschen haben mich unterst tzt und wollten mich laufen sehen ich habe mir gesagt ich muss es versuchen aber es ging nicht
5612042 we still have a frelling ace up our sleeve its an ace a frelling ace at tgs tokyo game show the capcom booth stage is going to make peoples balls pucker up its going to be big
5612043 as the secretary has said many times we have no plans on using the authority
5612044 i think every day that goes by without the companies raising capital the possibility of the treasury stepping in increases
5612045 kids are going to drink whether its legal or illegal
5612046 wed at least be able to have a more open dialogue with students about drinking as opposed to this sham where people dont want to talk about it because its a violation of the law
5612047 how many times must we relearn the lessons of prohibition
5612048 adults under 21 are deemed capable of voting signing contracts serving on juries and enlisting in the military but are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5612049 we have this law that in effect prevents any state from exploring new ways of addressing the issue
5612050 we have a crisis on our hands we need some new ideas and new thinking
5612051 drunk driving used to be a part of american culture until someone stood up and said we need to make a change and 25 years later designated driver is a commonplace term in every household in america
5612052 it gives me great pause to think of sending thousands of students onto a campus where the person who is most accountable doesnt seem to be devoted to ensuring their health and safety
5612053 if they drink too much in the beginning of an evening they can get alcohol poisoning
5612054 theyre really not aware of how their judgment is impaired we hope they dont get into a car or if theyre a young woman go to a fraternity party its just not healthy
5612055 a lot of young people feel that they are afraid of enforcement
5612056 they tend to get in a car and go someplace else and thats very very dangerous i worry about it every weekend
5612057 i think alcohol is seen a lot of times as a forbidden thing and people want it
5612058 its almost like contraband once you get it you have to drink all of it
5612059 maybe im being idealistic but in europe you can drink once you can see the bar
5612060 i think we should maybe take a lesson from what other countries are doing
5612061 lets debate the age and look at the pros and cons
5612062 i really think weve got to somehow be able to control it better because what we have done now is driven it underground and we cant do anything about it
5612063 there are a lot of things we could do if it wasnt underground
5612064 as you know im a big champion of investing in infrastructure
5612065 i believe that it is the key to competitiveness for the 21st century
5612066 the building canada plan has a dedicated fund for gateways and corridors because we want to ensure a seamless flow of goods and people that will ensure canada remains competitive
5612067 i urge you to build the business case find partners and examine all avenues that may provide funding
5612068 this will ensure our strategic gateways and trade corridors can improve overall system performance and reduce bottlenecks
5612069 we ought not to interfere with his decision that the plan is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances
5612070 implementation of the plan in his view would work to the overall greater benefit of noteholders as a whole i can find no error in principle it was his call to make
5612071 maybe consumers have to realize that in canada we pay very little for our food
5612072 a consumer may see that and feel good about buying that product knowing youre supporting your community and everything around it
5612073 thats an opinion among thousands of pages of evidence that are filed as part of the rate case
5612074 i think that the regulator will review all of the facts in september and will clearly see that the facts require us to have a rate increase to pay the cost of fuel
5612075 renewable projects typically come with long term fixed price energy contracts of 20 or 25 years so that helps to stabilize things going forward
5612076 would you use this resources or parts of it in your teaching in next fall
5612077 id like to be comfortable and be able to say to you that that is over but i dont see it yet i dont see those numbers yet telling me that
5612078 i would never have predicted this much damage it certainly is a serious problem that has yet to have been addressed and it will be some time before it is addressed
5612079 im real proud of the team and the results we delivered in light of the environment
5612080 all things considered the quality of the second earnings was good
5612081 while q3 will not be as strong and q2 was helped by seasonal and stimulus cheques this is first time in recent memory that the company did not lower guidance and actually raised it which is major psychological change and keeps us bullish on the company and our other quality names
5612082 the impact of foreign investment is being considered more and more by governments around the world
5612083 this has had an impact on omers in the past in one specific case related to our bid on a toll road in france
5612084 while our bid was competitive on price we lost the bid as a result of our not having a french partner
5612085 one of the reasons we are establishing omers worldwide is to grow our on the ground relationships with local partners across the globe to support our investment areas to bring successful deals to the table
5612086 youre always going to be more successful if you have a local partner
5612087 you can only rely on things like rule of law and proper business practices
5612088 they need to do a lot of due diligence and local partners can always help with some of the nuances
5612089 its unfair to say that its only the foreigners that are having issues we also have foreign investment review and discussions the banks are off the table
5612090 with the recent correction in the stock market and a slowing housing market canadians are seeing their net wealth position shrinking
5612091 a clear indication that the canadian economy is softening quickly
5612092 this environment poses a major challenge to markets and policy makers in north america
5612093 the household credit market is starting to reflect developments in the real economy
5612094 while on a year over year basis the growth numbers are still impressive the monthly figures clearly suggest that we are at the early stages of a softening trend in the pace of growth in overall household credit in canada
5612095 i dont think well be going off the cliff there may be a certain amount of reality to be faced in some areas because of the larger inventory and the slackening demand but i dont believe that were going to see anything like the united states has seen in recent times
5612096 i know im not ready im not dominating in this league yet i just have to keep learning and progressing really right now im just in a learning stage
5612097 ive seen him grow up tremendously in the way that he goes about his business
5612098 i think his time around people like matt wieters has allowed him to grow up and see what being a professional is all about his work ethic has gotten much better his knowledge of playing baseball is much better you knew hitting wise it was going to be a big step for him but theres no doubt in my mind that he will hit and hit for power
5612099 there are a lot of ups and downs it would be good to have better numbers but thats life all im going to do is work harder and get better
5612100 i was in intensive care for seven weeks i just laid there in pain im the perfect person to talk about this because i didnt know what i had and i didnt know what questions to ask i didnt know there were questions i should ask i didnt know how to describe the pain and that caused more problems
5612101 id seen maybe one or two staph infections in all my time in football but three years ago we put down a new synthetic turf on our football field and we began to have three to four cases a week
5612102 players didnt want to touch each other it wasnt until our trainer todd smith said he was going to try to disinfect the field that we got it under control
5612103 you know one day you cut yourself and you think its a cut i washed my hands i shaved i wasnt rubbing dirt in it but the next day its a raging infection
5612104 just like that its doctors and antibiotics and it had just been a little cut earl weaver four or five years ago went in for a normal arthroscopic knee surgery and ended up spending three months recovering from a staph infection
5612105 i think it would be cool to play in the world series of poker
5612106 my game is a little off right now so ill have to start improving it a
5612107 we all have a declining or flat birthrate and attracting immigrants is a key component to our future survival
5612108 by 2011 more people will be leaving the workforce than will be entering it that is just around the corner and we have to start planning now
5612109 we want to be able to go to the federal government with a policy that was developed in atlantic canada and that meets the needs of atlantic canada
5612110 we have a better chance of not only keeping more of our young people here but attracting more of them back home
5612111 if we take a regional approach it is a little easier to do
5612112 its really fun to play against people from other countries
5612113 we didnt realize how many people are out there just like us who love playing this game we are so psyched weve made it to the international finals
5612114 at the end of the day i would say the only way the consumer jumps in is if its subsidized
5612115 wed have to see a price point of somewhere around 200 to really show that theyre rim going after the apple market the iphone market or at least be more in the same ballpark
5612116 ouch and here i was still hoping that it would come in at 299 like the 16 gig iphone 3g silly me
5612117 it really comes down to what you need more in a phone while the bold certainly has improved media and other consumer features it really is a business device at the end of the day
5612118 the iphone 3g is a consumer device that happens to play nice with a lot of corporations and we honestly think you wont find many people dropping their blackberrys for an iphone theyll carry both as long as they can afford it
5612119 so some enterprise user who is very internet centric would certainly want to take advantage of the bold on the other hand somebody who may use it more for e mail applications for the most part the appeal isnt there
5612120 we believe investors should see rims growth outperforming peers in 08
5612121 while we continue to see real value in owning the majority of our real estate assets carefully selected sale leasebacks enable us to monetize the value of select properties creating financial flexibility while maintaining our overall operating flexibility
5612122 the properties included in this transaction are locations featuring stores that are either new or recently expanded so we do not see a need to relocate these stores in the foreseeable future
5612123 why do you bother reading idiot blogs if you think so highly of yourself and your precious time
5612124 and while jake sharp and angus quigley are decent veterans who can help the cause theyre hardly special talents who can carry the ground attack
5612125 properly inflated tires can improve gas mileage by up to 3 percent we could save millions of gallons of gas each year if everyone in the u s had properly inflated tires
5612126 it is a wonderful world wonderful indeed and of course it is wonderful for me to be here
5612127 eerst moeten we bewustwording cre ren en zodra we dat hebben komt het op de politieke agendas dan wordt er geld voor vrijgemaakt en dan kunnen de mensen die in het veld de projecten uitvoeren ook daadwerkelijk die sanitaire voorzieningen aanleggen die nodig zijn in ruraal gebied gaat het misschien om oplossingen voor eenpersoonshuishoudens het beter wassen van handen of het voorzichtiger omgaan met afval in stedelijke gebieden kan het gaan om rioleringssystemen met afvalwater zuivering
5612128 dit jaar is in het leven geroepen omdat de sanitatiedoelstelling achterbleef bij de waterdoelstelling dit jaar moet een extra impuls geven aan de aandacht voor sanitatie ik denk dat we nu op de juiste snelheid liggen met de juiste input om ook werkelijk een verschil te kunnen maken en een groot gedeelte van de millenniumdoelen te kunnen bereiken
5612129 inimesed lihtsalt tahavad teada t tt kuid etv pakub isegi informatiivsetes saadetes vaatajatele mitte uudiseid vaid kommentaare millest ei ole v imalik aru saada mis tegelikult toimub

5612131 make a list of what you were grateful for in bill gwatneys life
5612132 he was a better golfer than i was i am not grateful for that
5612133 but he seemed to genuinely like it if i hit a good shot which is a sign of grace

5612142 a chinese economy more than double the size of americas will almost certainly give china global commercial and international leadership
5612143 an important secondary influence like europe but it will need to compromise and its sphere for unilateral action will be increasingly curtailed
5612144 u s officials are more effective when they understand the chinese peoples perspective
5612145 vores m l er at nedbringe antallet af mennesker der har behov for f rtidspension
5612146 we in the south pacific take democracy seriously which is why we believe we cant sit idly by while our principles of democracy are shredded
5612147 depends on the policy of georgian president mikheil saakashvili and the action of his forces
5612148 we will do whatever is necessary and no one should have any illusion
5612149 nobody is planning to withdraw the russian contingent very swiftly as there is no such necessity
5612150 zimbabwes annual rate of inflation surged in june to 11 2 million percent
5612151 its all about choice if a woman or a father for that matter makes a choice to take a backward step in their career for a child then thats a matter of choice
5612152 but when its not their choice when the prejudice in the workplace makes that choice for them its a completely different matter
5612153 everyone acknowledges that theres been a decline in birth rate
5612154 that sort of long term issue isnt going to be addressed if were placing rigidities and barriers in place to people who want to have a career and family
5612155 a six to 12 month paid maternity leave scheme is not a radical proposition when you consider sweden the uk denmark and canada are already at this level or above and we believe this should be the starting point for discussion
5612156 if the largest employer in the country cant have flexible work arrangements that enable people to balance careers and families then theres no hope anywhere
5612157 and in my view the public sector is in many instances ahead of the private sector so if you did the same sort of analysis in the private sector youd find even greater disparities
5612158 zimbabwes annual rate of inflation surged in june to 11 2 million percent
5612159 it gained 9 035 045 5 percentage points from the may rate of 2 233 713 4 percent
5612160 zimbabweans must realise that the country is in a practically binding state of socio economic emergency
5612161 as such there is need for a universal moratorium on all incomes and prices for a minimum period of six months

5612165 it is also a pretty stark reminder how significantly it changed under the very nervous man that is wayne swan our treasurer and indeed prime minister kevin rudd
5612166 i can assure you i am very determined and i will lead us to the next election
5612167 it will take a while before they voters reach the point of deciding when they have had enough defects disappointments and breakdowns before they decide that maybe in hindsight that they didnt do the right thing
5612168 if you have got a small business overdraft a mortgage a credit card you are trying to put petrol in your car you want the government to succeed
5612169 we had a six per cent swing against mr rudd the biggest swing since the first by election in the whitlam government
5612170 i am not actually that interested in an indulgent exercise about who is going to be leader of the liberal party or who isnt we have a leader he is doing a good job
5612171 when i am walking across the street and chatting to people they are not talking to me about liberal party leadership
5612172 they are talking to me about the leadership of the australian economy and about the policy decisions that are being taken
5612173 we have heard about suicide bombers on foot they are receiving indirect fire
5612174 our commando units were deployed into the area and engaged the attackers and pushed them back
5612175 so far 13 attackers have been killed six blew themselves up six others died in the explosions and one died in gunfire from commandos their bodies have been recovered
5612176 thirteen suicide bombers were killed in kijran area of ali sher district
5612177 they were fired at we have found six bodies which were all wearing suicide vests
5612178 some of them have blown themselves up others are hiding in nearby houses and corn fields the troops are searching for them
5612179 it may be biased to view the deal as going against nuclear non proliferation efforts
5612180 for example the issue of global warming has been getting serious in recent years and co2 emissions from emerging nations such as china and india are becoming a problem
5612181 it is important that india proceeds with nuclear power generation as clean energy
5612182 japan which has suffered atomic bomb attacks should take the initiative in blocking the deal
5612183 it would be a pity if japan only follows us policy irrespective of what is just
5612184 india needs to join the npt first if it wants civilian use of nuclear energy
5612185 if this kind of exception is approved that means that the international community accepts india as a nuclear power that would shake the nonproliferation regime under the npt
5612186 nigels always had a great empathy for his teammates and he knows the game hes got a great empathy for the game
5612187 i believe he understands the game too more than most players
5612188 nigel im sure has never thought of any possibility that he would go on and be a coach of any shape or form but now the playing door has closed well then you open your life up to possibilities and thats obviously one of the distinct possibilities
5612189 but when you get to the end its sort of hard to walk away from something thats been a really big part of your life
5612190 theres a lot of options in different places where myself and my family can go weve just got to try and work out which ones the best one for us
5612191 its hard not to live in the moment and for me at the moment i havent been able to get what i want out of footy
5612192 so at the moment im sort of frustrated by what has happened this year
5612193 but my career as a whole has been really successful
5612194 i was waking up and not really looking forward to playing footy as i had in previous years and you just get the feeling it is time
5612195 id like to finish the job i started so long ago 15 years
5612196 it does go really quickly but id like to be here right to the end
5612197 the fact that drought assistance has been extended in 32 areas shows that farmers continue to struggle with the drought in many parts of the country despite recent rainfall in certain areas
5612198 more and more labs are showing that people have the sensitivity for skills that we thought were only expert skills
5612199 the uva study shows that listeners without formal musical training but with sufficient exposure to a certain musical idiom perform similarly in a musical task when compared to formally trained listeners
5612200 cy2007 resulted in a tam of 1 7busd in semiconductor timing revenues 3 5busd in xtal and oscillators and gt 10busd in power management ics
5612201 cy2007 showed further supplier consolidation some new entrants many offering disruptive technologies moving into the market cy2008 will be very challenging and dynamic as the suppliers jockey for position and as the new entrants make their initial moves the reports detail consumption by product category for consumer communications computing and industrial market segments weighted asps and volumes roll up for the tam and forecast providing a very real economical view of the segment with its players technology and products
5612202 we priced the reports to be practical while retaining value targeting the pricing at 1 1 5 weeks salary for a middle level product manager
5612203 the only actionable reports of this kind in the market today the cy2008 combined xtal oscillator amp semiconductor clock amp timing as an example is a 418 page comprehensive and detailed report combining these two key segments into one easy to use report
5612204 owais is going to bat at number three for the simple fact that i think he was wasted at number seven
5612205 hes a high scoring quick scoring cricket player who plays cricket shots to get boundaries and i think down the order he was wasted
5612206 when hes played for us hes always done really well he got a one day hundred against india last year and has got runs this year and i am going to give him the confidence to bat at number three with myself at number four
5612207 i havent thought about the twenty20 side yet but theres definitely a strong case for owais getting a good opportunity to bat and play long innings for england
5612208 i think its good to look back on things and see how well the team performed at times
5612209 sometimes you can look back and take things from there into the next campaign
5612210 but its forgotten about now were all trying to qualify for the world cup now
5612211 the most important thing is we all work together like we did the last time as a squad because the boys all get on great and that will be a big part of it as well
5612212 we want to generate the same again and hopefully go that step further and get there we did play really well as a team and a squad
5612213 some games were unbelievable france away with faddys goal and its hard when you look back because i thought we were extremely unlucky not to qualify
5612214 but if we can get that bit of luck on our side this time and improve then we can hopefully do it
5612215 i dont know if ive established myself as a first team regular i have to prove myself first
5612216 i dont think you ever establish yourself as a first team regular you have to prove yourself every time
5612217 youve got to stay in the side its not a case of turning up every time and expecting to play i dont think any player can do that
5612218 if you take your foot off the gas youll lose your place because thats what its like here
5612219 ive been in a lot of squads now 14 i think but i didnt play a lot under alex mcleish because of the way things were going at that time the boys were playing brilliantly i was just happy being in the squad and getting a game when i could
5612220 theres a new manager in and weve all got a chance to impress any time in your career being involved in the international squad is great
5612221 when youre playing in good sides whether its celtic or scotland there are always good players beside you that will take your place if youre not performing
5612222 thats just the way football is when you are playing at the highest level
5612223 im maybe the type of player who can play a long time
5612224 ive looked after myself over the years and i feel as if i get fitter and stronger every year
5612225 i feel really good you just take it as it comes
5612226 we want to win every single game but as the manager points out he wants to try some things the more games you win it breeds confidence
5612227 see we arent letting them be above the law they just didnt do anything that bad
5612228 that means the game is done it is now in the hands of microsoft
5612229 at this time we cannot give you details on release date or points cost as we do not have that information theres plenty of really cool stuff in this new update to a classic title
5612230 in just a few weeks we are going to throw open our doors and invite more players into the game than ever before they will have a chance to delve into the open beta and see for themselves that war has arrived and it is glorious
5612231 we knew we didnt want to reinvest in the neighborhood
5612232 the industry has changed so much and the little niche we entered when i started the brand and the demands in this niche have changed so i asked myself
5612233 have disappeared from fashion in order to accelerate the product i feel i have just become another cog in that machinery
5612234 what i learned from having this business i could apply anywhere
5612235 it could be interiors graphics scents anything evoking an atmosphere thats where id like to situate myself
5612236 in the end he also became the man who couldnt deliver bush was very slow to realize that he either had been had by musharraf or that musharraf was not up to the task historians will debate this for years
5612237 the new pakistani general hes just been elected not elected this guy took over office
5612238 it wasnt a personal relationship but musharraf tried to play it effectively for domestic advantage
5612239 we pretty much played the musharraf card ad nauseam eventually to pakistans detriment
5612240 so far ive found him to be a man of his word
5612241 the fundamental question i have for president musharraf is will these elections be under emergency rule or law because if they are its going to be hard for well itll be hard for those of us who have belief that hes advanced pakistans democracy to say thats thats still the case
5612242 president bush and vice president cheney backed a discredited dictator which has undercut our ability to work with the new government to eliminate the terrorist sanctuary that has re emerged in pakistans tribal areas
5612243 president musharraf took his country a long way in turning it back from the extremism that was starting to characterize it at the time of sept 11 2001 he also kept his promise to try and help a transition to free and fair elections we didnt agree with everything he did especially the state of emergency but he did take off the military uniform the elections were free and fair
5612244 he tried to play both ends moving against certain terrorist targets but more broadly letting the terrorists increase their influence in his own country he campaigned for democratic reform then staged faulty elections to help himself stay in power
5612245 it may be biased to view the deal as going against nuclear non proliferation efforts
5612246 for example the issue of global warming has been getting serious in recent years and co2 emissions from emerging nations such as china and india are becoming a problem
5612247 it is important that india proceeds with nuclear power generation as clean energy
5612248 japan which has suffered atomic bomb attacks should take the initiative in blocking the deal
5612249 it would be a pity if japan only follows us policy irrespective of what is just
5612250 india needs to join the npt first if it wants civilian use of nuclear energy
5612251 if this kind of exception is approved that means that the international community accepts india as a nuclear power that would shake the nonproliferation regime under the npt
5612252 its because of that experience that when i hear women are being treated unfairly in the workplace where theres injustice and theres not the basic principle of equal pay for equal work i get mad i get frustrated
5612253 in the term of the next president skillful handling of such a crisis could be the difference between temporary hardship and far reaching disaster
5612254 many of you served in places that once seemed remote and obscure and the veterans of foreign wars know better than anyone how inattention to small crises can invite much larger ones
5612255 sen obama still cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
5612256 as they have said to me on my trips to iraq let us win just let us win
5612257 we need a commander in chief who is ready to lead not one in training
5612258 im sorry but obama doesnt have the background to run the military
5612259 fundamentally different world view of who government should fight for
5612260 my daughters i dont want them to ever confront a situation where they are disadvantaged because of their gender
5612261 i guess if youre making 3 million a year youre middle class but thats reflected in his policies
5612262 this is the first time ive really felt like i can barely make ends meet
5612263 he was indias best bet in pakistan we will miss musharraf
5612264 if he had not fired his judges and gotten bogged down in domestic dramas i believe we would have been able to make a significant breakthrough in a peace deal in kashmir today
5612265 we have no comments to make on the resignation of president musharraf of pakistan
5612266 still musharraf was a one man go to guy in pakistan now who do we speak to these are very uncertain times
5612267 if a lactating female with a calf goes past and this calf approaches that animal it may accept it but its a very slim chance
5612268 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
5612269 the situation has been improving quite a lot tension in the area has ceased and we hope that the situation will go back to normal as soon as possible
5612270 a lasting solution to border problems between cambodia and thailand
5612271 our two countries share a lot of economic and trade interests
5612272 we are very close to deciding to send the prime minister for the closing ceremony of the olympics to be participated by many foreign dignitaries
5612273 you all know we have bent as far backward as possible to give peace a chance
5612274 the patience of our soldiers in trying to uphold the primacy of the peace process is very commendable but at some point we really have to act decisively
5612275 we will pursue and take aggressive action against the perpetrators of the dastardly acts committed against innocent civilians
5612276 we regret the loss of lives and property in lanao del norte but we would to emphasise that the milf leadership has not authorised these actions
5612277 if they cant control them the government will certainly control them and we will undertake our mandate to protect the people and the communities and we cannot renege on that constitutional mandate

5612333 i am very saddened to hear of the death of m ire today she was a huge influence on the development of the party and her work in the areas of education and language influenced the party greatly m ires tenacity and enthusiasm were infectious
5612334 she served on south dublin county council along with my ministerial colleague trevor sargent and was always popular with members across all parties she will be remembered affectionately as a loyal and dedicated member of the green party and one of irelands most original thinkers

5612339 six short term deals between the iraqi government and international oil companies are likely to be abandoned after the us embassy said talks had broken down yesterday short term technical support contracts between the iraqi government and the multinational companies each worth around 500m 268 were due to have been signed earlier this year but stalled due to disagreements over terms a senior diplomat said charles ries co ordinator for iraqs economic transition at the us embassy in baghdad admitted that talks between the iraqi government and a consortium led by us based anadarko had already fallen through others with royal dutch shell a joint venture between shell and bhp billiton bp exxon mobil and a venture between chevron and total now seem unlikely to go ahead it appears that on present form the iraqi government probably wont proceed with most of these or all of them mr ries said but i think some of the companies are open to continued discussions even on relationship grounds and some of the companies dont think its worth their time had limited appeal for the oil companies but some had hoped to go on to win longer term development contracts which would be far more lucrative the deals would have given global oil companies their first major involvement in iraqs oil sector in nearly 40 years
5612340 we are going to see more flash flooding and more storms we need to plan accordingly
5612341 there will be a 20 per cent increase in precipitation in the future there will be increases in wind speed and more storms when it does rain it will be more heavily
5612342 any future significant development will have to carry out a flood risk assessment as part of the planning process
5612343 it essentially means the end of any major construction on flood plains
5612344 the lack of urgency from the government is shocking when so many homes businesses and communities are in danger of being washed out
5612345 overall it will be changeable but the rainfall will not be as heavy or torrential as we have seen
5612346 judges can punish men who force their daughters to marry like this

5612351 we have still got this area of low pressure bringing clouds and showery rain but when we get to friday and into the weekend we start to see a ridge of high pressure building from the south west and hopefully keeping us in the south and east a little bit drier and brighter
5612352 things are certainly looking much better for the weekend especially saturday and sunday
5612353 its great news that it looks like we are going to get a brighter weekend ahead
5612354 the great thing about norfolk is its got so many attractions across the county to suit any interest thats the key thing
5612355 it is good news a sunny bank holiday is a shot in the arm no doubt about it
5612356 it has been a mixed august we are calling it a rollercoaster some days are fantastic and some a little disappointing because of the weather so you are right up or down
5612357 people forget theres an awful lot of tourism as indoors so if there is sunshine and showers its giving everybody a chance
5612358 i love the fraternity brothers because theyre so young and such a contrasting team
5612359 one takes his time to think things out the other one loves to rush and go at a million miles an hour theres definitely tension between the two of them while theyre making decisions during the race
5612360 they are small we wanted to make sure that there wasnt anything to prevent us from putting that pack underneath the seat in front of us when we got on a plane we didnt want something to happen where we got delayed because of our luggage we thought that would help us go faster
5612361 we did extensive research on what to wear what was lightweight and would help us move the fastest
5612362 i think it was the longest i ever went without wearing a logo on my t shirt
5612363 we both tried to do some training along the lines of going down to our little gym but that was pretty much it
5612364 we have an emerging farm so we do a lot of work out there splitting wood and taking care of the horses
5612365 people were a little afraid we were going to pull a borat on them i told them we werent doing borat but what happened there is very very funny its not easy to shoot in places like that because they practically have no television industry
5612366 the teams have no idea how to get from point a to point b there
5612367 they dont know the language its very difficult to get through this country they get so stuck but they find so many fascinating solutions of how to get through everything one of the things the teams do there is go to a real life floating village its insane

5612371 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5612372 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5612373 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5612374 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5612375 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5612376 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5612377 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5612378 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5612379 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5612380 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5612381 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5612382 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5612383 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5612384 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice

5612694 there were periods when i wished i was able to tell people about my condition
5612695 but now even at the age of 29 i dont want to go out on the streets without my make up
5612696 there are millions of people who do wear make up each day for different reasons and i am just one of them but i dont feel i could go out without my vitiligo covered up which sounds pretty sad
5612697 but it is just the way it is for me
5612698 wearing no make up for the ads was good i had been in front of strangers without make up for a short time but with the video a much wider range of people have seen it
5612699 of course my family have seen me before without make up as has my boyfriend and some very close friends
5612700 but even people i work with havent so doing the advert was a big deal for me
5612701 as a child of four i have to admit that i was blissfully unaware of any difference between other children and myself

5612703 it is only when you are a teenager and start staying over at other girls houses that it becomes a bit of a pain having to put the make up on and take it off and i did not feel comfortable telling people who were not in my family
5612704 and when you are a teenager it is all about how you look
5612705 the colour match was so perfect that it meant i didnt have to tell anybody unless i wanted to
5612706 however by not being honest with people other than my family i still was not accepting the fact that this was likely to be with me for the rest of my life and i still had never asked myself if this was something i could cope with forever
5612707 teenagers and people in their early 20s are the most susceptible to psychological and emotional trauma experienced at the onset of the condition
5612708 people with vitiligo dont tend to go swimming or wear a summer dress because of the taboos associated with the skin and because of our obsession with a perfect body and especially the skin

5612776 according to the wahhabi creed it was imperative to return to a presumed pristine simple straightforward islam which could be entirely reclaimed by literal implementation of the commands of the prophet and by strict adherence to correct ritual practice importantly wahhabism rejected any attempt to interpret the divine law historically or contextually with attendant possibilities of reinterpretation under changed circumstances it treated the vast majority of islamic history as corruption of true and authentic islam
5612777 in the late 18th century the al saud family united with the wahhabi movement and rebelled against ottoman rule in arabia the rebellions were very bloody and the wahhabis indiscriminately slaughtered and terrorized muslims and non muslims alike interestingly mainstream jurists writings at the time such as the hanafi ibn abidin and the maliki al sawi branded the wahhabis the modern day khawarij of islam and condemned their fanaticism ad intolerance in 1818 egyptian forced under the leadership of muhammad ali defeated this rebellion and wahhabism seemed destined to become another fringe historical experience with no lasting impact on islamic theology but the wahhabi creed was resuscitated in the early 20th century under the leadership of abd al aziz ibn saud who allied himself with wahhabi militant rebels know as the ikhwan in the beginnings of what would become saudi arabia even with the formation of the saudi state wahhabism remained a creed of limited influence until the mid 1970s when the sharp rise in oil prices together with aggressive saudi proselytizing dramatically contributed to its wide dissemination in the muslim world wahhabism did not propagate itself as one school of thought or a particular orientation within islam rather it asserted itself as the orthodox straight path of islam moreover the proponents of wahhabism refused to be labeled or categorized as followers of any particular figure including abd al wahhab himself its proponents insisted that they were simply abiding by the dictates of al salaf al salih the rightly guided predecessors namely the prophet and his companions and in doing so wahhabis were able to appropriate the symbolism and categories of salafism ironically salafism was founded in the early 20th century by al afghani muhammad abduh and rashid ridaas a liberal theological orientation to respond to the demands of modernity they argued muslims needed to return to the original sources of the quran and sunnah and engage in de novo interpretations of the text by the 1970s however wahhabism had succeeded in transforming salafism from a liberal modernist orientation to a literalist puritan and conservative theology the sharp rises in oil prices in 1975 enabled saudi arabia the main proponent of wahhabism to disseminate the wahhabi creed under a salafi guise which purported to revert back to the accretions of historical practice in reality however saudi arabia projected its own fairly conservative cultural practices onto the textual sources of islam ad went on to proselytize these projections as the embodiment of islamic orthodoxy
5612778 and your husband and thats my son but i cant tell you for some time where i was since i left you but some time i might have the power but not now
5612779 the mozart school of music should obviously be the first choice of any music student aware of its reputation first of all the mozart school stresses intensive practice and training so that students typically begin their training at a very young age second the school has ample facilities and up to date professional equipment and its faculty includes some of the most distinguished music teachers in the world finally many mozart graduates have gone on to be the best known and most highly paid musicians in the nation
5612780 we must not make a scarecrow of the law setting it up to fear the birds of prey and let it keep one shape till custom make it their perch and not their terror

5612786 squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5612787 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5612788 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5612789 i could tell from three strides out that my body was a little bit too leaned back and for a split second i kind of lost focus which threw me off
5612790 i realised we went out too fast the pace was 25 seconds at 200 metres and 1 24 at 600 metres so it was a little bit too tough for me but i knew if i wanted to finish with a medal i had to go with the kenyans to have a shot at a medal
5612791 i just wasnt strong enough at the end the rest of the field all caught up with me

5612802 having choices we dont like is no choice at all
5612803 i love the fraternity brothers because theyre so young and such a contrasting team
5612804 one takes his time to think things out the other one loves to rush and go at a million miles an hour theres definitely tension between the two of them while theyre making decisions during the race
5612805 they are small we wanted to make sure that there wasnt anything to prevent us from putting that pack underneath the seat in front of us when we got on a plane we didnt want something to happen where we got delayed because of our luggage we thought that would help us go faster
5612806 we did extensive research on what to wear what was lightweight and would help us move the fastest
5612807 i think it was the longest i ever went without wearing a logo on my t shirt
5612808 we both tried to do some training along the lines of going down to our little gym but that was pretty much it
5612809 we have an emerging farm so we do a lot of work out there splitting wood and taking care of the horses
5612810 people were a little afraid we were going to pull a borat on them i told them we werent doing borat but what happened there is very very funny its not easy to shoot in places like that because they practically have no television industry
5612811 the teams have no idea how to get from point a to point b there
5612812 they dont know the language its very difficult to get through this country they get so stuck but they find so many fascinating solutions of how to get through everything one of the things the teams do there is go to a real life floating village its insane

5612818 the only profit a company has is the community that it creates
5612819 while maintaining connection and care for the people that you work with and the community that you serve to survive the loss of one core product is remarkable for a company to survive two miraculous it must be corporate dna

5612834 to me the mystical thing about him is the most ordinary the dalai lama is happy hes happy in the midst of chaos and turmoil

5612839 they had details of explosives and poisons along with information about london landmarks and a computer folder on royal residences wed be foolish to rule out the fact that they may have been planning an attack
5612840 let there be no doubt these are dangerous individuals these men were not simply in possession of material which expressed extremist views they were also in possession of material that was operationally useful to anyone wishing to carry out an act of violence or terrorism

5612850 i am a complete foodie i do diet but i love to eat with my families and my girlfriend luckily i am blessed with good genes so there is no major exercise regime
5612851 i came back to the uk and got wheeled off the plane a first i must say i felt a bit like elizabeth taylor
5612852 i got an mri magnetic resonance imaging scan this morning and am now sitting up in bed with my left foot like a dead fish freezing and numb
5612853 the surgery went as planned and annie is now recuperating at home
5612854 annie would like to send her thanks and appreciation to all who have sent their well wishes in the past few days
5612855 i am a complete foodie i do diet but i love to eat with my families and my girlfriend luckily i am blessed with good genes so there is no major exercise regime
5612856 while she understands jamie likes to spend time with his new squeeze she worries that his focus on the band is slipping
5612857 shes particularly upset at present because shes frequently unable to track him down by phone or email at all
5612858 she was called into the diary room and spoke to her agent and then her consultant in the uk she just burst into tears ran out and said to housemates i have cancer
5612859 jade was then led out of the house and she is coming back to england to see another consultant she is completely devastated
5612860 i am a complete foodie i do diet but i love to eat with my families and my girlfriend luckily i am blessed with good genes so there is no major exercise regime
5612861 jeff shouldnt we stay out of this part of the lake and stick to where the counselors can see us
5612862 aw dont be such a worry wart anyway what could possibly
5612863 were gonna capsize were gonna capsize where are the life jackets
5612864 i guess i kinda um lost my cool out there but you were the man how did you ever pull that off
5612865 you know jeff im not really sure i just wasnt that scared could be cuz when i was younger i had pretty bad asthma and couldnt do a lot of stuff one of the games i used to play to keep myself occupied was called what would you do if i used to make up really scary dangerous situations and id have to figure out how to get out of them this was nothing compared to being charged by a pack of elephants in a rainstorm
5612866 i feel that i am a good man even though i dont do all of the mitzvot commandments in the torah
5612867 what is the checklist to know whether one is actually good
5612868 what does feeling that i am good have to do with whether or not one is actually a good person
5612869 see i have set before you this day life and good death and evil
5612870 the wicked even in their own lives are considered dead
5612871 do not say because of my virtue that god brought me to occupy this land
5612872 man does not live by bread alone but by all that comes out of gods mouth
5612873 only that you remain in awe of god your lord so that you will follow all his paths and love him serving god your lord with all your heart and with all your soul you must keep gods commandments and decrees so that all good will be yours
5612874 and it shall be if you hearken to my commandments which i command you this day
5612875 decent middle of the road christians think they can have it both ways
5612876 i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right
5612877 jen will never kiss and tell but its she who ended the relationship mayers childish behavior only confirms she was right to dump him now hes acting like a spoiled child expect jen to behave like a lady
5612878 its all a bit sad to be honest with you
5612879 if she loves him then good for her but if it was done for attention its a bit sad
5612880 i did stuff like that when i was nineteen as well like get a tattoo because it pi ed my mum off
5612881 its just a great big cry for help and if anything people need to stop talking about her badly and you know maybe all she needs is a hug
5612882 i love the fraternity brothers because theyre so young and such a contrasting team

5612892 were just happy to continue making the show as it is
5612893 the idea is to get energy relief money as well as the permanent fund dividend before winter hits so people have their money to offset the astronomical costs we are seeing for energy
5612894 squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama

5612899 teachers pay more attention to people messing around than people who want to learn
5612900 the only way to make money is selling dope on the corner
5612901 it gives a really powerful message that if youre not in school were going to your home
5612902 most of the time we find dropouts not working and not happy with life
5612903 education is truly an equalizer i want our youngsters to have that opportunity

5612946 the afghan national army is saying that anytime we get close to them they detonate themselves
5612947 but a few years ago i asked some students if they knew what watergate was and they said that was where monica lewinsky lived
5612948 it also prevents students from thinking that the way something is now is the way its always been
5612949 continuing worries about a u s economy slowdown which may spread to the euro zone and perhaps also asia are weighing down on oil pricing
5612950 in the near term there will be a lot of downward pressure but i dont foresee a fast collapse of pricing to 100 dollars a barrel or below there is still strong support at 110 a barrel level because of supply side issues

5612952 to have any type of disfigurement and to wake up and realise they dont look like themselves thats terrifying
5612953 its difficult for anybody to deal with never mind a 16 year old boy
5612954 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5612955 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5612956 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5612957 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5612958 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5612959 if so many of the peppers we eat in the u s come in from mexico youd think we would want to pay more attention
5612960 were still here and working hard on getting alan wake for you to enjoy sure weve been in development for a long time and if everything had gone perfectly smoothly there probably would be a game out for you guys to play already but designing a completely new game can be hard and sometimes you need to take a detour to find the best route forward
5612961 theres a lack of well paying jobs in the area
5612962 when folks have a chance to move on they move on
5612963 teachers pay more attention to people messing around than people who want to learn
5612964 the only way to make money is selling dope on the corner

5612969 it is within our ministers south african home affairs minister mapisa nqakula powers to declare groups of people as refugees for a period of time
5612970 this would assist us in processing the large numbers of southern africans who are mostly zimbabweans approaching our center
5612971 what is needed is a regional solution in which people are given some sort of s a d c status it has been talked about but repeatedly blocked by countries like south africa more bilateral agreements on movement from one country to another are definitely needed
5612972 the six month status under that initiative is fairly clear and it only applies to people in the safety camps set up to house victims of the recent xenophobia while i think there is a need for some sort of protection for these people in the case of this id scheme we would be back in the same situation in six months and i dont see them home affairs developing a longer term strategy
5612973 two and a half years since the start of the refugee backlog project we see the same chaos we the assessment team first experienced when joining home affairs in september 2005 with a new backlog larger than the one that has just been effectively cleared
5612974 when i arrived in may 2008 we were only taking in 50 applicants a day and now we have brought that up to between 300 and 400 so progress is being made but the whole process is in transition and it is not helped by the fact that on thursdays and fridays we are quite literally swamped by between 2 500 and 3 500 zimbabweans who are seeking asylum

5613034 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money

5613044 in other words individuals who are said to have an internal locus of control believe that they control their own destiny and that they make things happen while those with an external locus of control believe that their successes failures and other events in their lives are caused by luck or fate and that circumstances are beyond their control there are advantages and disadvantages with both but secular psychology generally considers an internal locus of control the healthier position of the two those with an internal locus of control tend to take more responsibility for their behaviour while those with an external locus of control tend to be more anxious about the world around them kramer and moore argue that christianity promotes an external locus of control by discouraging the individual from exercising her his own will thinking back to when i was a christian i can easily remember how i was encouraged to adopt an external locus of control by 1 submitting to the belief that god knows better no matter what happens i should trust him 2 thinking that events in my life happened according to gods will 3 adopting the beliefs of the church without thinking them through on topics such as homosexuality evolution abortion etc and 4 viewing christ as the final authority of my life in other words i believed that the course of my life was directed by an outside source the question is was this a healthy belief
5613045 i was raised as a born again christian which mean that i had to turn my life over to christ and his will i never blamed the devil or sin for falling short of the glory of god as paul says i always blamed myself and wondered why i couldnt be a better person if christ indeed lived in me more stringent christians will remark that this implies i wasnt a true christian but i would beg to differ anyway i am now an atheist and my atheism is a result of my recognition of the truth of naturalism we are fully determined creatures who are products of a confluence of our genetic heritage and life experiences we are ultimately neither blameworthy nor praiseworthy but we are proximately blameworthy or praiseworthy because the actions of nature flow through us they have their existence in our being and our behavior they are made manifest through us so in that sense we are responsible for our actions because these actions didnt occur via anyone else but our actions are indeed beyond our control since we are beings who are fully embedded in the natural fabric of the universe as schopenhauer realized a man can surely do what he wants to do but he cant determine what he wants one can do a very simple experiment to confirm this the 18th century scottish philosopher david hume did it sit and medidate and try to clear you mind of all thought you will quickly find that thoughts simply happen to you you do not choose to think once you have the thoughts you are certainly able to act on them but you do not generate them many have argued rightly in my opinion that there isnt even a you to do the generating but thats a comment for another day if youre interested in how someone lives without belief in god free will a self soul or an ultimate meaning or purpose to life please check out my blog dasein amp dharma
5613046 hi juno about our supposed responsibility for our actions you said but we are proximately blameworthy or praiseworthy because the actions of nature flow through us they have their existence in our being and our behavior they are made manifest through us so in that sense we are responsible for our actions because these actions didnt occur via anyone else this is a complete redefinition of the plain idea of responsibility are dominoes responsible for knocking over the next domino when you stack them up in a line simply because the actions of nature flowed through it bad domino im putting you back in the box for a long time there is no difference in your view between a dominos action and a humans action and to say that our actions are beyond our control runs contrary to our first person awareness of our own control over our actions try a simple experiment choose to do something its that simple as to humes thought experiment his reasoning is badly mistaken just because certain thoughts happen to us doesnt mean that all thoughts happen to us indeed our thought life can have a mind of its own but that does not mean that we have no control over our thoughts indeed people have achieved various degrees of control over their thought life through many different avenues of discipline again try an experiment think about something of your choice its that simple i think humes introspective abilities were clouded by his materialism we need to trust our introspection which runs contrary to a naturalistic worldview when we introspect we find a me a me who can choose things loves things can change over time due to choices otherwise this me is an illusion created by the brain which imho is far less likely than what our introspection is telling us
5613047 anonymous youre correct in stating that i am providing a complete redefinition of what most people consider to be responsibility but you are presenting a false analogy dominoes are inert and inanimate while human beings are alive and possessed of the abilities of rationality and deliberation we can deliberate about the choices with which we are faced and choose among the options but we are fully determined with the possible exception of quantum randomness to choose the way we do there are many things which run contrary to our first person awareness if the human species relied solely on its first person awareness to judge reality we probably never would have made it out of the bronze age the harvard psychologist daniel wegner does and has done numerous experiments on how we perceive the level of control we have over our own actions i suggest you read his book the illusion of conscious will i frequently meditate on my experience of choice of course humans can choose to do something the more pertinent question is why did they choose to do what they did the philosopher galen strawson explains this very well in an interview in the believer magazine heres the link our best neuroscience is showing us that despite our folk intuitions there is no me inside us there is no cartesian homunculus making decisions in fact there is no one place in the brain where it all comes together as philosopher daniel dennett says humans used to be convinced that lightning and thunder were a result of the wrath of the gods that the earth was flat and that the sun revolved around the earth all very reasonable assumptions based on the level of knowledge at the time but as our knowledge of reality has advanced our folk notions about reality have had to retreat time and time again

5613050 here we show that male fish astatotilapia burtoni can successfully make inferences on a hierarchy implied by pairwise fights between rival males these fish learned the implied hierarchy vicariously as bystanders by watching fights between rivals arranged around them in separate tank units our findings show that fish use transitive inference when trained on socially relevant stimuli and that they can make such inferences by using indirect information alone

5613052 darwinism was different it was not just that the theory of evolution like the theory of a spherical moving earth is in conflict with biblical literalism it was not just that evolution like the copernican theory denied a central status to humans and it was not just that evolution like newtons theory provided a non religious explanation for natural phenomena that had seemed inexplicable without divine intervention much worse among the natural phenomena explained by natural selection were the very features of humanity of which we are most proud it became plausible that our love for our mates and children and according to the work of modern evolutionary biologists even more abstract moral principles such as loyalty charity and honesty have an origin in evolution rather than in a divinely created soul

5613060 the question of jesus being a member of the godhead claimed for him by some of his followers is foreign to the present view which is merely an estimate of the intrinsic merits of his doctrines
5613061 but while this syllabus is meant to place the character of jesus in its true and high light as no impostor himself but a great reformer of the hebrew code of religion it is not to be understood that i am with him in all his doctrines i am a materialist he takes the side of spiritualism
5613062 among the sayings and discourses imputed to him by his biographers i find so much ignorance so much absurdity so much untruth charlatanism and imposture as to pronounce it impossible that such contradictions should have proceeded from the same being i restore to him the former and leave the latter to the stupidity of some and roguery of others of his disciples
5613063 and the words separation of powers and checks and balances arent in there either but i bet he teaches those concepts when discussing the constitution thats because those are descriptive phrases for various provisions in the constitution used by the founders themselves to so describe them
5613064 the question of his being a member of the godhead or in direct communication with it claimed for him by some of his followers and denied by others is foreign to the present view which is merely an estimate of the intrinsic merits of his doctrines

5613066 among the sayings and discourses imputed to him by his biographers i find many passages of fine imagination correct morality and of the most lovely benevolence and others again of so much ignorance so much absurdity so much untruth charlatanism and imposture as to pronounce it impossible that such contradictions should have proceeded from the same being i separate therefore the gold from the dross restore to him the former and leave the latter to the stupidity of some and roguery of others of his disciples of this band of dupes and impostors paul was the great coryphaeus and first corruptor of the doctrines of jesus

5613126 many sme owners spend too much time on relatively arbitrary functions instead of paying a specialist to handle it for them however the problem is twofold one is that the business owner may not trust the available service providers or know how to find them and the other is one of cash flow
5613127 these services are strategic by nature the business owner who has recognised the need for specialised strategic support has moved beyond an operational focus he is working on the business as opposed to working in the business
5613128 that 27 cited crime as the most worrying factor came as something of a surprise
5613129 this was out of a laundry list of woes that included options such as traffic and the threat of competition
5613130 when competition keeps you awake youre concerned about market share this doesnt seem to be a bother for south african entrepreneurs and is more a factor of the corporate environment
5613131 most salaried people dont have these concerns as they have predictability of income and assurance of pension funds or other such structures
5613132 these are questions of operational efficiency while essential this focus must be balanced with due attention to strategic development of the business
5613133 this is both the scourge and the beauty of the smaller business if you dont worry about cash flow who will it is a function of that which is most pressing to the business but this has to be balanced with strategic insight and direction
5613134 is that those companies which make use of mentoring or coaching are in the minority 9 yet this is the biggest differentiator in this category in terms of high levels of competitiveness 50 of those using these services regard themselves as highly competitive versus 41 of the rest so it appears that such services are highly advantageous
5613135 even the banker is not independent and almost every business owner will not have a relationship of full disclosure with the bank the accountant is likely to have the clearest picture of the business certainly from a financial point of view
5613136 a mentor is analogous to a non executive director who can provide independent advice and guidance however mentoring is not well understood or trusted it is expensive and finding the right coach can be a challenge

5613183 clinically proven antiaging treatments such as topical retinoic acid carbon dioxide laser resurfacing and intradermal injection of cross linked hyaluronic acid stimulate production of new undamaged collagen attachment of fibroblasts to this new collagen allows stretch which in turn balances collagen production and degradation and thereby slows the aging process collagen fragmentation is responsible for loss of structural integrity and impairment of fibroblast function in aged human skin treatments that stimulate production of new nonfragmented collagen should provide substantial improvement to the appearance and health of aged skin

5613185 a recent review in the archives of dermatology concludes that three anti aging treatments are proven clinically effective the topical application of retinol carbon dioxide laser resurfacing and injection of hyaluronic acid a moisture retaining acid that occurs naturally in the skin each depends on the same mechanism the interaction of skin cells called fibroblasts with the collagen they produce

5613394 i think there is not enough understanding of the fact that in a democracy how you treat the security of the minority must be a very important part for the success of a democracy you cant only make token gestures and actually let them be in the state that they are as the rajinder sachar committee report shows so what happened is token gestures are made but real issues are never addressed

5613401 frustrated vendors have been placing their property in the market to let as they have been unable to agree sales due to a lack of demand in the housing market
5613402 many would be buyers have been forced to rent as the route to mortgage finance has been blocked
5613403 established investors have been reaping the benefits of the housing downturn for sometime and will continue to do so in the short term
5613404 however ever increasing supply could have an impact on rental growth as tenant options increase
5613405 a major factor in recent weeks is that many unsold houses are being withdrawn from sale and offered for rental instead
5613406 there is an oversupply of rental property in the market due to property owners unable to sell their properties attempting to let them
5613407 there is no way the first world can solve this problem alone even if the united states comes in

5613468 pulmonary physicians are looking desperately for anything to improve the clinical course of patients with copd
5613469 the main finding is that all three arms of pharmacotherapy and this included inhaled corticosteroids a long acting beta agonist called salmeterol and a combination of both were effective in altering the rate of decline
5613470 so the decline was not as quick and as steep as those patients who were receiving placebo
5613471 this study is a much larger study and it does have some of the same flaws as the other studies mainly that some patients are not contributing any data on lung function in fact a large number
5613472 and because of that you cant really know thats why my editorial says theres some hopeful signs here but we cant really be conclusive
5613473 well why should we want to use all of these medications and especially the combination one
5613474 if the three drug therapies are giving exactly the same slope of decline the same improvement in slope of decline which one of the three should we choose
5613475 they should choose the safest one and thats the salmeterol by itself

5613485 now that this sort of has this pattern or this trend ive written in and ive touched on 50s 60s 70s i thought ok lets see what we can come up with that has an 80s flair to it
5613486 i really wanted to be a part of it but i also knew that i really needed to focus
5613487 i had to make a choice because i wanted to make sure that all of my attention would be put towards one thing
5613488 i know that i need a certain amount of attention as an artist its like you got to know what your worth is you know
5613489 she looked into my eyes and she said as long as your intent is pure you will not be denied and thats something that has stayed with me forever

5613652 it says a lot about our team and how motivated we are to win
5613653 were just disrupting everything theyre trying to do not letting them relax on offense or defense
5613654 we could have easily come in and had one of those games where we were making excuses
5613655 but we didnt take a step backward and that was good

5613662 we dont know how to explain this so when we dont know how to explain things in the medical world we call it a miracle this is probably what happened
5613663 we are 12 days out now and its time to start getting a little more serious about things and start honing in
5613664 we all know the opportunity we have and we definitely have to get it done so whatever we need to do we need to do time is running out
5613665 were not where we need to be 12 days out we certainly have to make a lot of progress in 12 days
5613666 we have to go out and execute our offense that is the bottom line
5613667 a lot of times the o line gets most of it but a lot of time its the quarterback not getting the ball out of his hands in time or the receivers not running the right depth its attention to detail once again
5613668 i want to understand the kids and im going to be flexible
5613669 some kids have to work and some are still coming im open to accepting more kids as school starts this is not my program this is the kids team

5613671 i just want to have fun and win a few games prove to the younger kids we can win
5613672 my role is just to lead to teach them what ive learned from all my coaches
5613673 its our team we may only have 40 guys but we have the heart of 120 guys the heart of this team is huge and we have a lot of prove

5613676 its tough right now its tough to swallow but were going to take great things away from this
5613677 beautiful olympic games a lot of emotions here but the basketball was not successful
5613678 by a slight slight edge as of today gaskins is the no 2 quarterback
5613679 it was very close but thats what our staff has decided
5613680 daniel sorensen was one of the highlights of the scrimmage on saturday not only in special teams but the way he is playing defense
5613681 sean has done the best job of running our entire offense and doing everything that we need to do with our offense
5613682 he has a little more huddle command right now and thats simply because hes older and has more experience diondre is making great strides and sean knows that diondre is a person we trust to put into the ball game you have to start somewhere and you have to start someone for that first series we feel we have two guys we can use
5613683 sean setzer will be our quarterback for the unlv game but we anticipate diondre will be in the game for a significant amount of time because of his running ability
5613684 we do not teach that in china or in the u s
5613685 this is what the olympics is about having extraordinary performances
5613686 all i will say is that my client maintains his innocence

5613754 porque sino la pregunta es qui n es m s delincuente el que tiene placa o el que no tiene placa por eso es tan importante que en este debate de la seguridad tengamos la centralidad del tema y no confundamos las causas con las consecuencias
5613755 y me parece que el tema toma dimensi n no solo por la relevancia de los hechos no s lo por el estrato econ mico de este joven mart sino porque evoca y provoca lo que ya se hab a venido diciendo

5613765 i saw the coach flying through the garden and just dialled 999
5613766 from what i could see a coach had crashed at the hill and ploughed through a neighbours garden
5613767 it ploughed through two cars parked in a driveway one of them was bouncing down the road the other must have flown along with the coach
5613768 it must have dropped about twenty feet it was on a slope its diagonal not headfirst
5613769 there were people climbing out of the fire exits on the bus the majority of the people were walking wounded probably half a dozen serious injuries
5613770 its a narrow country road its mayhem absolute mayhem we had a torrential downpour of rain just before it happened it was an accident waiting to happen

5613858 all cases of attacks against media workers must be properly investigated and the wrong doers brought to justice
5613859 the incident drew responses from the governments senior leadership including prime minister abdullah ahmad badawi
5613860 both the bn and pkr are now accusing each other as being behind the incident
5613861 free and independent media are the core fundamentals of democracy it is appalling when violence is used against press workers to intimidate them it is even more shocking when the media is targeted to satisfy a political agenda
5613862 the police and security forces must ensure that journalists are free to carry out their duties without fear of harassment and assault

5613983 sesungguhnya dalam penciptaan langit dan bumi silih bergantinya malam dan siang bahtera yang berlayar di laut membawa apa yang berguna bagi manusia dan apa yang allah turunkan dari langit berupa air lalu dengan air itu dia hidupkan bumi sesudah mati kering nya dan dia sebarkan di bumi itu segala jenis hewan dan pengisaran angin dan awan yang dikendalikan antara langit dan bumi sungguh terdapat tanda tanda keesaan dan kebesaran allah bagi kaum yang memikirkan
5613984 allah akan meninggikan orang orang yang beriman diantara kamu dan orang orang yang diberi ilmu pengetahuan beberapa derajat
5613985 berpikir itu bagaikan pelita hati apabila daya berpikir itu hilang maka hilanglah cahaya baginya
5613986 dan sesungguhnya kami telah menguji orang orang yang sebelum mereka maka sesungguhnya allah mengetahui orang orang yang benar dan orang orang yang dusta
5613987 teruslah berjuang sampai akhir hayat hingga kita kembali ke dalam
5613988 aku tidak akan menjelekkan orang orang yang mengatakan bahwa menyentuh kemaluan tidak membatalkan wudhu sekalipun itu sependapat dengan aku
5613989 amat dibenci oleh allah bahwa kamu mengatakan apa apa yang tiada kamu kerjakan
5613990 hai orang orang yang beriman taatlah kepada allah dan rasul nya dan janganlah kamu berpaling daripada nya sedang kamu mendengar perintah perintahnya
5613991 dan janganlah kamu menjadi sebagaimana orang orang munafik yang berkata
5613992 kami tidak mendengar apa yang dikatakan oleh muhammad dan dari apa yang dia sebutkan dan dia isyaratkan kami tidak melihatnya
5613993 pada hari betis disingkapkan dan mereka dipanggil untuk bersujud maka mereka tidak kuasa dalam keadaan pandangan mereka tunduk ke bawah lagi mereka diliputi kehinaan dan sesungguhnya mereka dahulu di dunia diseru untuk bersujud dan mereka dalam keadaan sejahtera
5613994 sesungguhnya binatang mahluk yang seburuk buruknya pada sisi allah ialah orang orang yang pekak dan tuli yang tidak mengerti apa apa pun kalau kiranya allah mengetahui kebaikan ada pada mereka tentulah allah menjadi kan mereka dapat mendengar dan jikalau allah menjadikan mereka dapat mendengar niscaya mereka pasti berpaling juga sedangkan mereka memalingkan diri dari apa yang mereka mereka dengar itu
5613995 hai orang orang beriman penuhilah seruan allah dan seruan rasul apabila rasul menyeru kamu kepada suatu yang memberi kehidupan kepada kamu dan ketahuilah bahwa sesungguhnya allah membatasi antara manusia dan hatinya dan sesungguhnya kepada nyalah kamu akan dikumpulkan
5613996 ar roiyyatu tahta diini mulukihim yang artinya baik buruknya rakyat itu terletak dibawah kualitas agama pemimpinnya
5613997 berkata yusuf jadikanlah aku bendaharawan negara mesir sesungguhnya aku adalah orang yang pandai menjaga lagi berpengetahuan
5613998 seseorang berada diatas agama kawan dekatnya maka hendaklah setiap kamu berhati hati dengan siapa kamu berkawan
5613999 al mar u alaa diini kholilihi falyanzhur ahadukum man yukhollil
5614000 sesungguhnya bilangan bulan di sisi allah adalah 12 bulan dalam ketetapan kitab allah sejak hari dia menciptakan langit dan bumi
5614001 islam bermula datang dalam keadaan asing dan suatu saat nanti akan kembali asing seperti semula maka berbahagialah orang orang yang asing tersebut
5614002 hai orang orang yang beriman janganlah suatu kaum mengolok olokkan kaum yang lain karena boleh jadi mereka yang diolok olokkan lebih baik dari mereka yang mengolok olokkan dan jangan pula wanita wanita mengolok olokkan wanita wanita lain karena boleh jadi wanita wanita yang diperolok olokkan lebih baik dari wanita yang mengolok olokkan
5614003 istihzaa menghina allah subhanahu wataaala agama nya dan rasul nya merupakan sebuah kekufuran yang nyata dan yang menyebabkan pelakunya keluar dari islam secara menyeluruh
5614004 sesungguhnya menghina allah subhanahu wataaala ayat ayat dan rasul nya adalah kekufuran yang pelakunya menjadi kafir setelah ia beriman
5614005 sesungguhnya istihzaa menghina jenggot merupakan sebuah kemungkaran yang besar ucapan wahai jenggot dengan maksud merendahkan dan menghina adalah kufur dan apabila hanya bermaksud sebagai pengenal maka bukanlah kekufuran hanya saja panggilan seperti itu tidaklah sepatutnya untuk dilakukan
5614006 dan jika kamu tanyakan kepada mereka tentang apa yang mereka lakukan itu tentulah mereka akan menjawab sesungguhnya kami hanya bersenda gurau dan bermain main saja katakanlah apakah dengan allah ayat ayat nya dan rasul nya kamu selalu berolok olok tidak usah kamu minta maaf karena kamu kafir sesudah beriman jika kami memaafkan segolongan daripada kamu lantaran mereka taubat niscaya kami akan mengazab golongan yang lain disebabkan mereka adalah orang orang yang selalu berbuat dosa
5614007 wahai rasulullah shallallahu alahi wasallam sesungguhnya kami hanya bermain main dan bersenda gurau lalu rasulullah shallallahu alahi wasallam bersabda dengan membaca ayat yang artinya
5614008 hal ini menunjukkan bahwa sungguh sungguh dan bermain main dalam menampakkan kata kata kekufuran adalah sama
5614009 sesungguhnya menghina allah subhanahu wataaala dan rasul nya adalah sebuah kekufuran yang dapat mengeluarkan pelakunya dari agama islam menjadi kafir karena dasar pokok agama ini dibangun di atas pengagungan kepada allah subhanahu wataaala agama islam dan rasul nya dan istihzaa terhadap hal tersebut berarti ia telah menghapus dan membatalkan dasar pokok agama tersebut
5614010 sebagian orang ada yang kerjaannya mencari cari kesalahan para ahli ilmu apakah ia pernah bertemu ataupun belum pernah bertemu mereka seperti ucapannya
5614011 kehidupan dunia dijadikan indah dalam pandangan orang orang kafir dan mereka memandang hina orang orang yang beriman padahal orang orang yang bertakwa itu lebih mulia dari pada mereka di hari kiamat dan allah memberi rezki kepada orang orang yang dikehendaki nya tanpa batas
5614012 tinggallah dengan hina didalamnya dan janganlah kamu berbicara dengan aku
5614013 dan orang orang yang menyakiti orang orang mukmin dan mukminat tanpa kesalahan yang mereka perbuat maka sesungguhnya mereka telah memikul kebohongan dan dosa yang nyata
5614014 dan sungguh allah telah menurunkan kepada kamu di dalam al quran bahwa apabila kamu mendengar ayat ayat allah diingkari dan diperolok olokkan oleh orang orang kafir maka janganlah kamu duduk beserta mereka sehingga mereka memasuki pembicaraan yang lain karena sesungguhnya kalau kamu berbuat demikian tentulah kamu serupa dengan mereka sesungguhnya allah akan mengumpulkan semua orang orang munafik dan orang orang kafir di dalam jahannam

5614025 dan setelah datang kepada mereka seorang rasul dari sisi allah yang membenarkan apa kitab yang ada pada mereka sebahagian dari orang orang yang diberi kitab taurat melemparkan kitab allah ke belakang punggung nya seolah olah mereka tidak me ngetahui bahwa itu adalah kitab allah
5614026 barangsiapa yang menjadi musuh jibril maka jibril itu telah menurunkannya ke dalam hatimu dengan seizin allah membenarkan apa kitab kitab yang sebelumnya dan menjadi petunjuk serta berita gembira bagi orang orang yang beriman qs al baqarah
5614027 dan kami telah turunkan kepadamu dengan membawa kebenaran membenarkan apa yang sebelumnya yaitu kitab kitab yang diturunkan sebelumnya dan batu ujian terhadap kitab kitab yang lain itu maka putuskanlah perkara mereka menurut apa yang allah turunkan dan janganlah kamu mengikuti hawa nafsu mereka dengan meninggalkan kebenaran yang telah datang kepadamu untuk tiap tiap umat di antara kamu kami berikan aturan dan jalan yang terang sekiranya allah menghendaki niscaya kamu dijadikan nya satu umat saja tetapi allah hendak menguji kamu terhadap pemberian nya kepadamu maka berlomba lombalah berbuat kebajikan hanya kepada allah lah kembali kamu semuanya lalu diberitahukan nya kepadamu apa yang telah kamu perselisihkan itu
5614028 pada hari ini orang orang kafir telah putus asa untuk mengalahkan agamamu sebab itu janganlah kamu takut kepada mereka dan takutlah kepada ku pada hari ini telah kusempurnakan untuk kamu agamamu dan telah ku cukupkan kepadamu nikmat ku dan telah ku ridhai islam itu menjadi agama bagimu
5614029 dan kami tidak mengutus kamu melainkan kepada umat manusia seluruhnya sebagai pembawa berita gembira dan sebagai pemberi peringatan tetapi kebanyakan manusia tiada mengetahui
5614030 dan tiadalah kami mengutus kamu melainkan untuk menjadi rahmat bagi semesta alam
5614031 dan muhammad itu bukanlah bapak dari salah seorang lelaki di antara kalian tetapi ia adalah rasul allah dan nabi yang terakhir dan adalah allah maha mengetahui terhadap segala sesuatu
5614032 muhammad saw itu bukanlah ayah dari salah seorang lelaki diantara kalian zaid bin haritsah r a yaitu anak angkat nabi saw melainkan beliau adalah nabi terakhir maka tiada lagi nabi setelah beliau sampai hari kiamat dan adalah allah swt terhadap segala perbuatan dan perkataan kalian maha mengetahui
5614033 pertama saat nabi saw menikah dengan zainab mantan istri zaid bin haritsah r a orang orang munafik berkata dia muhammad menikahi mantan istri anaknya sendiri maka ayat ini turun untuk membantah haltersebut kedua bahwa muhammad saw adalah nabi terakhir tiada nabi sesudahnya yang membawa syariat baru ketiga syariat beliau menyempurnakan syariat sebelumnya sebagaimana sabdanya aku diutus untuk menyempurnakan akhlak yang mulia atau sabdanya yang lain perumpamaanku dengan nabi sebelumku seperti perumpamaan seorang yang membuat bangunan yang amat indah tinggal sebuah lubang batu bata yang belum dipasang maka akulah batu bata tersebut dan akulah nabi yang terakhir
5614034 bahwa setelah menjelaskan tentang beliau saw bukanlah ayah dari zaid bin haritsah r a sehingga halal beliau menikahi zainab r a ayat ini juga menggariskan tentang pemenuhan hukum syariat yang masih tersisa yang harus diketahui dan disampaikan kepada umat manusia sebagai realisasi dari penutup risalah langit untuk di bumi ini tidak boleh ada pengurangan dan tidak boleh ada perubahan semuanya harus disampaikan
5614035 sungguh dia lah yang paling mengetahui apa yang paling baik dan paling tepat bagi para hamba nya maka ia memfardhukan kepada nabi nya apa yang seharusnya dan memilihkan bagi beliau apa yang terbaik ia menetapkan hukum nya ini sesuai dengan pengetahuan nya yang meliputi segala sesuatu dan ilmu nya tentang mana yang terbaik tentang hukum aturan dan undang undang serta sesuai dengan kasih sayang nya kepada semua hamba nya yang beriman

5614049 ketika kaum muslimin berada dalam shalat fajar di hari senin sedangkan abu bakar menjadi imam mereka ketika itu mereka dikejutkan oleh muhammad saw yang membuka hijab kamar aisyah beliau melihat kaum muslimin sedang dalam shaf shalat kemudian beliau tersenyum kepada mereka
5614050 wajah merupakan cermin yang tepat bagi perasaan hati seseorang wajah yang ceria penuh senyuman alami senyum tulus adalah sebaik baik sarana memperoleh teman dan kerja sama dengan pihak lain senyum lebih berharga dibanding sebuah pemberian yang dihadiahkan seorang pria dan lebih menarik dari lipstik dan bedak yang menempel di wajah seorang wanita senyum bukti cinta tulus dan persahabatan yang murni
5614051 saya minta setiap mahasiswa saya untuk tersenyum kepada orang tertentu sekali setiap pekannya

5614065 im completely totally devastated and the thing that hurts me most is that i wasnt there when she went to heaven
5614066 it wasnt anything criminal on anybodys part the dog lunged at the girl and tragic circumstances resulted
5614067 the 20 year old on all appearances was taking good care of the two children that were there there was no malice or anything done on her part to cause the dog to do this
5614068 i knew that sooner or later something was going to happen it was inevitable
5614069 im not going to defend the dog in any way shape or form for what he did to my child but at the same time my grandmother is not around my children enough to know exactly what is going on
5614070 pit bulls can make wonderful pets theyre no more likely to bite than many other dogs
5614071 this is definitely a very tragic situation and you hate to see this kind of thing happen this isnt something that anyone expects
5614072 tom there is no way im going to let phil hellmuth beat me today for a bracelet no way
5614073 i heard that jerry buss told you if you win three in a row he was going to get you an nba championship ring you sure came pretty close johnny was that a true story
5614074 in 1987 i was in a poker game at the bicycle club with jerry buss before the wsop and jerry threw me a 100 chip across the table and said here johnny i want 1 of you in the wsop main event
5614075 if i was smart i would have said jerry let me buy 1 of the lakers the lakers lost to detroit in 1989 and i lost to phil hellmuth the same year jerry did offer to get me an nba ring if i won the wsop three years in a row and i came pretty close to pulling it off
5614076 that is the worst play ive ever seen going all in in that spot
5614077 showing everybody what he just did is the worst play
5614078 we set out a game plan that we thought would be successful
5614079 we executed about 99 percent of it at the end of the day its how many times you put the ball in the net
5614080 we worked hard to make sure we were in the olympics
5614081 we drew against teams ranked ahead of us we had no olympic experience
5614082 it is disappointing and frustrating but we are going to come out no matter what position we are fighting for and we are going to play our hardest
5614083 most americans still connect john philip sousas name with the best known and best loved of all marches and a fair number of us can sing the nonsense lyrics that some anonymous wag set to the tune of the trio section in his lifetime though the march king was far more than a mere composer

5614086 he gave wagner liszt and tchaikowsky in the belief that he was educating his public i gave wagner liszt and tchaikowsky with the hope that i was entertaining my public
5614087 i began to sense the rhythmic beat of a band playing within my brain it kept on ceaselessly playing playing playing i did not transfer a note of that music to paper while i was on the steamer but when we reached shore i set down the measures that my brain band had been playing for me and not a note of it has ever been changed
5614088 a new piece commissioned by the bbc from jonathan harvey will give the power of speech to an oboe violins a cello and even an entire orchestra this new piece entitled speakings has been made possible by digital technology developed at ircam the underground music research institute founded in paris by pierre boulez more than 30 years ago
5614089 id been listening to mahlers third symphony which starts off by describing what the rocks tell me i loved the idea of speaking rocks
5614090 then each of the following movements ascends up the scale of being until we learn what love tells me all this inspired me to write a piece that has a similar evolutionary narrative
5614091 my piece starts with a sense of a paradisal innocence which is broken by a babys scream this is the moment of incarnation when the human spirit descends down to earth and takes on a bodily existence to begin with language hasnt yet become articulate its as if the instruments are cooing and gurgling
5614092 it comes out of ircams long running project to analyse speech and then digitally synthesise it
5614093 its a difficult task because the physics of consonants and vowels is hugely complex one spin off of this research is new software that can impose these speech formants as theyre called onto other sounds in my new piece ive used this software to create the sense that instruments are speaking and singing simultaneously
5614094 and what really interests me is combining those rhythms and melodies with the purely musical melodies ive composed its really a different way of thinking about polyphony
5614095 it becomes very calm and sustained as if all the instruments are singing the same chant im aiming at a state someone once described as a gregorian paradise its the moment of transcendence a loss of self when everything merges together
5614096 well i started as a christian and ive never officially left
5614097 we know there is much work to be done on all our islands

5614103 when composers have tried to set shakespeare they have run up against the problem that his verse creates music in the mind next to which even the most inspired efforts may be found wanting nonetheless the number of shakespeare operas runs well into the hundreds

5614112 having songs for tibet participate in our worldwide vigils along with robert thurman and recently receiving the support of his holiness the dalai lama creates a united action front that can do so much more for the people and culture of tibet
5614113 according to the recording industry assn shipments of vinyl soared 36 6 from 2006 to 2007 that amounts to 1 3 million units nationwide while the numbers are minuscule compared to cd shipments of 511 million for 2007 the news is much welcomed by a faltering music industry

5614118 he did a whole speech about how sound matters and someone needs to stand up for sound
5614119 vinyl is still really a niche thing but its a bigger niche to the point where the accounting department is actually asking me about projections now

5614122 the bible is the ultimate authority by which every realm of human knowledge and endeavor should be judged
5614123 the bible is to be believed in all that it teachers obeyed in all that it requires and trusted in all that it promises
5614124 since god is incomprehensible and we are only human we cannot claim to have any firm understanding of him or his truth
5614125 we wanted to affirm that the gospel has power to change lives and something of the nature of that transformed life should be included in our statement of faith

5614145 there is a tendency to believe that while the culture around many be becoming more technological human nature remains intact in fact we have to admit that our own human natures are being reformed redefined and remade by technology
5614146 technology is not merely a human derived entity the roots of technology go all the way back to the big bang its part of the same line that i call extropic systems these are complex sustainable systems that always teeter on the edge of falling over but keep going we see extropic systems in galaxy formation planet formation life formation intelligence formation and i believe technology formation

5614149 aku tidak mendapati pada hartaku satu dirham pun dari harta yang haram atau satu dirham pun dari harta yang syubhat
5614150 aku masuk ke berbagai negeri yaitu basrah syam hijaz dan kufah aku melihat di berbagai negeri tersebut bahwa para ulamanya bila menyebutkan muhammad bin ismail al bukhari selalu mereka lebih mengutamakannya daripada diri diri mereka
5614151 para ulama ahli hadits di bashrah di jaman al bukhari masih hidup merasa lebih rendah pengetahuannya dalam hadits dibanding al imam al bukhari padahal beliau ini masih muda belia sehingga pernah ketika beliau berjalan di kota bashrah beliau dikerumuni para penuntut ilmu akhirnya beliau dipaksa duduk di pinggir jalan dan dikerumuni ribuan orang yang menanyakan kepada beliau berbagai masalah agama padahal wajah beliau masih belum tumbuh rambut pada dagunya dan juga belum tumbuh kumis
5614152 barangsiapa ingin menyambut muhammad bin ismail besok silakan menyambutnya karena aku akan menyambutnya
5614153 ketika muhammad bin ismail datang ke naisabur semua pejabat pemerintah dan semua ulama menyambutnya di batas negeri
5614154 wahai abu abdillah yakni al bukhari apa pendapatmu tentang orang yang menyatakan bahwa lafadhku ketika membaca adalah makhluk apakah memang demikian atau lafadh orang yang membaca itu bukan makhluk
5614155 kalamullah perkataan allah dan bukan makhluk sedangkan perbuatan hamba allah adalah makhluk dan menguji orang dalam masalah ini adalah perbuatan bidah
5614156 setelah orang meninggalkan al bukhari orang orang yang meninggalkan beliau itu sempat datang kepada beliau dan mengatakan
5614157 saya tidak akan mencabut pernyataan saya kecuali bila mereka yang meninggalkanku menunjukkan hujjah argumentasi yang lebih kuat dari hujjahku
5614158 sungguh aku amat kagum dengan tegarnya dan kokohnya al bukhari dalam berpegang dengan pendirian
5614159 ketahuilah sesungguhnya siapa saja yang masih mendatangi majelis al bukhari dilarang datang ke majelis kita ini karena orang orang di baghdad telah memberitakan melalui surat kepada kami bahwa orang ini yakni al bukhari mengatakan bahwa lafadhku ketika membaca adalah makhluk kata mereka yang ada di baghdad bahwa al bukhari telah dinasehati untuk jangan berkata demikian tetapi dia terus mengatakan demikian oleh karena itu jangan ada yang mendekatinya dan barangsiapa mendekatinya maka janganlah mendekati kami
5614160 adalah kalamullah yakni firman allah dan bukan makhluk dari segala sisinya dan dari segala keadaan
5614161 orang ini yakni al bukhari tidak boleh bertempat tinggal di negeri ini bersama aku
5614162 wahai abu abdillah yakni al bukhari orang ini yakni adz dzuhli sangat berpengaruh di khurasan khususnya di kota ini yakni kota naisabur dia telah terlalu jauh dalam berbicara tentang perkara ini sehingga tak seorang pun dari kami bisa menasehatinya dalam perkara ini maka bagaimana pendapatmu
5614163 dan aku serahkan urusanku kepada allah sesungguhnya allah maha melihat hamba hamba nya
5614164 ya allah sungguh engkau tahu bahwa aku tinggal di naisabur tidaklah bertujuan jahat dan tidak pula bertujuan dengan kejelekan engkau juga mengetahui ya allah bahwa aku tidak mempunyai ambisi untuk memimpin hanyasaja karena aku terpaksa pulang ke negeriku karena para penentangku telah menguasai keadaan dan sungguh orang ini yakni adz dzuhli membidikku semata mata karena hasad dengki terhadap apa yang allah telah berikan kepadaku daripada ilmu
5614165 wahai ahmad aku akan meninggalkan naisabur besok agar kalian terlepas dari berbagai problem akibat omongannya yakni omongan adz dzuhli karena sebab keberadaanku
5614166 selamat tinggal naisabur rasanya tidak mungkin lagi aku berjumpa denganmu
5614167 orang ini pengacau dia akan merusakkan kehidupan keagamaan di kota ini muhammad bin yahya telah mengusir dia dari naisabur padahal dia imam ahli hadits
5614168 aku tidak akan menghinakan ilmu ini dan aku tidak akan membawa ilmu ini dari pintu ke pintu oleh karena itu bila anda memerlukan ilmu ini maka hendaknya anda datang saja ke masjidku atau ke rumahku bila sikapku yang demikian ini tidak menyenangkanmu engkau adalah penguasa silakan engkau melarang aku untuk membuka majelis ilmu ini agar aku punya alasan di sisi allah di hari kiamat bahwa aku tidaklah menyembunyikan ilmu tetapi dilarang oleh penguasa untuk menyampaikannya
5614169 aku melihat muhammad bin ismail pada hari beliau diusir dari negeri bukhara aku mendekat kepadanya dan aku bertanya kepadanya
5614170 ya allah bumi serasa sempit bagiku tolonglah ya allah engkau panggil aku keharibaan mu
5614171 barangsiapa yang mengatakan bahwa aku telah berpendapat bahwa lafadhku ketika membaca adalah makhluk maka sungguh dia adalah pendusta karena sesungguhnya aku tidak pernah mengatakan demikian
5614172 wahai abu amir hafal baik baik apa yang aku ucapkan siapa yang menyangka bahwa aku berpendapat bahwa lafadhku tentang adalah makhluk baik dia dari penduduk naisabur qaumis ar roy hamadzan hulwan baghdad kuffah basrah makkah atau madinah maka ketahuilah bahwa yang menyangka aku demikian itu adalah pendusta karena sesungguhnya aku tidaklah mengatakan demikian hanya saja aku mengatakan segenap perbuatan hamba allah itu adalah makhluk
5614173 abu abdillah al bukhari telah berkata gerak gerik hamba allah suara mereka tingkah laku mereka segala tulisan mereka adalah makhluk adapun yang dibaca dengan suara huruf huruf tertentu yang ditulis di lembaran lembaran penulisan yang dihafal di hati para penghafalnya maka semua itu adlaah kalamullah perkataan allah dan bukan makhluk
5614174 kalamullah dan bukan makhluk barangsiapa yang mengatakan bahwa itu makhluk maka sungguh dia telah kafir
5614175 apalagi yang kalian tunggu dari ulama setelah kalian berbuat menvonis dan menilai

5614178 the claims made in the counter suit by joe francis are not only false but scurrilous beyond imagination
5614179 mr francis obviously felt secure making such defamatory statements under the protection of a judicial pleading
5614180 however he has recently made other false and defamatory public statements we not only intend to press the proper charges for collection of his gambling debts but we will also pursue mr francis for damages resulting from those incredibly damaging and libelous statements each and every statement made by mr francis is an outrageous falsehood and he will be held accountable for those statements
5614181 suffered injury to his reputation shame mortification hurt feelings and emotional distress
5614182 falsely imply that the hotel did not keep contractual agreements with francis and that the hotel did not do business with francis in a fair and ethical manner the statements falsely imply that francis possesses some undisclosed facts that show that wynn deceives customers

5614190 i have to say that out of all your posts this one pushed me over the edge
5614191 many homosexual people feel isolated in a world where homosexual attraction is shunned
5614192 were different because of associated psychological and behavioural disorders and may seek treatment in order to change it
5614193 most disturbing of all you advocate public policy that strips people of their dignity and personal freedom based on very little information much of it clearly seemingly non academic in nature and contradicted by every psychology and sexual education professional ive ever met
5614194 as a gay friend said to me no one would choose this lifestyle
5614195 in all my years being a clinical psychologist many teens and adults with same sex sexual attractions have come to me asking for help to become heterosexual but no one with heterosexual attractions has ever come asking my help to become develop a homosexual lifestyle

5614197 you may strive to be like them but seek not to make them like you

5614246 i truly do want to know how to describe clouds but to say theres a piece over here with that much density and next to it a piece with this much density to accumulate that much detailed information i think is wrong its certainly not how a human being perceives those things and its not how an artist perceives them somewhere the business of writing down partial differential equations is not to have done the world on the problem somehow the wonderous promise of the earth is that there are beautiful things in it things wonderous and alluring and by the virtue of your trade you want to understand them

5614254 while young people may be using sunbeds as they think they make them look good now in the long term they are doing serious damage to their looks

5614288 de herdenking is terecht zo veel mensen hebben zo veel goeds gedaan het is goed dat ze vandaag aandacht krijgen ik ben hier voor mijn opa hij is mijn held hij zat in japan als krijgsgevangene als we samen gaan wandelen vertelt hij me wel eens verhalen hij vertelt natuurlijk niet alles dat begrijp ik wel
5614289 in het jongenskamp van het 15e bataljon was het verboden om een potlood of papier te hebben beschreven of onbeschreven kennisoverdracht was verboden op elke bijeenkomst stond een straf en die was dat je gevangene werd van de kempei tai de japanse militaire politie daar wist je zouden marteling en onthoofding je lot zijn toch waren er in het kamp mannen die hun leven riskeerden om ons jongens te onderwijzen ik noem hen de stille helden want hun namen heb ik nooit gekend
5614290 de geschiedenis over wat er in al die kampen gebeurd is moet verteld worden
5614291 want het uitverkoren volk japan weigert structureel zijn oorlogsmisdaden toe te geven zelfverheerlijking gaat niet samen met boetedoening daarom is het belangrijk dat wij blijven herdenken
5614292 leven zonder geschiedenis is als leven zonder een geheugen ken je je geschiedenis niet dan zal die zich herhalen ik was uitgemergeld toen ik bevrijd werd ik woog 21 kilo en toch hoe vreselijk die japanse bezetting ook was de oorlog die daarop volgde was v l erger

5614296 de derde generatie gaat haar eigen weg in ons nieuwste stuk circus bronbeek laten we heel duidelijk die generatie een rol spelen
5614297 de derde generatie gespeeld door patrick neumann heeft in circus bronbeek een grotere rol dan in sloom bloed circus bronbeek is bovendien harder dan sloom bloed sloom bloed registreert circus bronbeek is actiever het is in de vorm van cabaret wij zochten naar een manier om als het ware de ervaringen van de ontbrekende man de eerste generatie een plek te geven zonder in pi teit te vervallen we ontdekten dat in sommige kampen ge nterneerden cabaretuitvoeringen hadden dat was grimmige humor en daar hebben we gebruik van gemaakt

5614522 its like two boys at school they dont even have to say anything to make each other laugh
5614523 i had to go off set one time and hide behind the cameraman i was the deciding vote for this guy to put him through or not and my honest opinion was no
5614524 i dont know how many family members came from around and i was literally like ok i need to hide now
5614525 a veces hay que presionar a las m s j venes para que no pierdan la perspectiva pero he tenido poco trabajo con eso estamos todas totalmente concentradas
5614526 creo que estamos jugando muy bien a un nivel t cnico f sico y mental
5614527 hoy jugamos muy bien ante jap n siempre es dif cil
5614528 lo que pase de ahora en adelante lo dejo en manos de dios
5614529 nunca podemos escoger al oponente por eso nos vamos a preparar para derrotar a cualquier que nos toque
5614530 f cil no es nada pero estamos satisfechas porque el equipo de brasil est jugando muy bien
5614531 consideramos que los juegos ol mpicos ser n otra plataforma para disfrutar del golf
5614532 seguramente sergio garc a tom nota de la l grima que solt rafael nadal en la ceremonia de entrega de la medalla de oro

5614536 pero en el 2016 presentar amos los mejores jugadores del mundo
5614537 jugar contra jap n siempre es dif cil en algunas partes del partido fuimos jugando bola a bola
5614538 jugamos bien esta ma ana pero lo que viene ser diferente hay que ir d a a d a
5614539 no creo que sea un problema salir como favoritos los otros tambi n son equipos fuertes s lo tenemos que jugar lo nuestro
5614540 hoy fue nuestro ltimo partido perdimos pero estoy satisfecho esto fue un resultado de cuatro a os de entrenamientos y creo que hemos mejorado la t cnica y adem s las jugadoras han sumado experiencia
5614541 sigue promocion ndose la miner a de uranio sin ning n tipo de consulta previa e
5614542 pr stamo del banco mundial para sanear colas de uranio de malarg e
5614543 hay una interpretaci n de la opini n p blica que donde hubo uranio hay problemas y no es as
5614544 la miner a de uranio es de alto riesgo para los trabajadores y el medio ambiente no podemos permitir la degradaci n ambiental y poner en riesgo las fuentes de agua potable el uranio contamina el agua
5614545 sigue promocion ndose la miner a de uranio sin ning n tipo de consulta previa e ignorando que organismos de energ a at mica a nivel mundial protegen m s sus propios intereses que la seguridad y la salud de la poblaci n
5614546 el precio del uranio costaba 180 d lares el kilo en 2007 y se estima que podr a alcanzar los 500 en 2009
5614547 si no se modifica eso corremos el riesgo de que a pesar de ser un pa s con uranio tengamos que salir a comprarlo hoy se importa mientras hay un pu ado de empresas extranjeras importantes canadienses brit nicas y australianas que quieren llevarse nuestro uranio para satisfacer sus demandas lo extraen en bruto y le ponen el valor agregado en sus pa ses de origen es ah donde est el riesgo de contaminaci n

5614556 it would be logical to simply put up for sale the loss making mines
5614557 all history is about roads until the airplane came along
5614558 the reason were sitting here today is because the road came through
5614559 it was the only way through the two counties after a flood that you didnt have to cross a river
5614560 when the military cut the road they werent just going off into uncharted territory
5614561 it looked very much like any other log home with a spinning wheel and a cast iron skillet
5614562 in the 1820s the cherokee nation was only a fraction of what it once was
5614563 then three things happened that were bad for the cherokees
5614564 the trail of tears really started on the front porch of every cherokee household
5614565 the worst conditions really were during the roundup when they used bayonets to herd them conditions were similar to civil war prison camps they werent quite as bad along the trip because they could travel and have food along the way
5614566 she was 13 and shed traveled with her family 1 800 miles
5614567 do you know how close that is to indian territory she died within sight of it
5614568 we were just too late to save it there is stuff all over northwest arkansas that we didnt know about three years ago from points east we know how far it was from there to here but the research is ongoing
5614569 his goal early in life was to be a stagecoach driver by age 19 he was a driver and owned his own livery
5614570 in 1840 gold was found in california and many people migrated to the west
5614571 in 1850 california threatens succession if there is no mail
5614572 and he had a couple of partners in the business one named wells and one named fargo
5614573 in one year he had accumulated 250 concord coaches and 500 other vehicles such as water wagons hay wagons and lighter celerity coaches
5614574 he had 3 000 tons of hay stored along 2 800 miles and water wells dug at relay posts 12 to 14 miles apart he hired 1 200 employees including superintendents road bosses drivers guards conductors keepers blacksmiths harness makers hostlers and clerks he spent 1 million which would now be 15 million he started with 146 stations and increased this to 200
5614575 he wore a top hat and a yellow duster and black pants stuffed into black boots
5614576 they traveled day and night giving new meaning to are we there yet
5614577 his wife ran the station there he built a hotel across the street and the stable set about where fayetteville city hall is today
5614578 the butterfield overland express was the first overland transcontinental mail by stagecoach
5614579 it was the longest stagecoach line in world history 2 812 miles the butterfield stage line was a major factor in the settlement of arkansas and the west before the civil war
5614580 troops march down the road and they encounter other troops thats where the battle happens thats what happened at pea ridge
5614581 the battle was there because of the road from st louis to fort smith everybody used the same road the army went up and down it many times going to the indian territory
5614582 pea ridge was the largest battle west of the mississippi
5614583 arkansas at that time was the hinterlands the frontier was 20 miles away
5614584 the road was only as wide as a wagon and marching at just four men across it took a long time
5614585 the parks visitor center is where curtis makes last stand
5614586 it was so loud they could hear it in fayetteville and springfield it was the first thunder in the ozarks in march it was artillery
5614587 it was stocked full of food pickles sardines oysters eggs
5614588 they were eating not fighting and their ammunition train was far behind they had no ammunition
5614589 the wire road got more use in december 1862 union brig gen frances herron on his way to fayetteville passed the body of his dead horse lying there from a previous battle they used these roads all the time
5614590 people from the same county fought on both sides the first washington artillery for the union was out of fayetteville
5614591 the only people left were those who had no way to go
5614592 that tears at society it was so bad in northwest arkansas they built fortified towns southern towns and northern towns and set up blockades of the mail for the most part it worked
5614593 it was very dangerous tough living for those who stayed here
5614594 for as long as the hardrock mining industry has reported its toxic output its been the worst polluter in the country

5614631 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5614632 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5614633 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5614634 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5614635 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5614636 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this
5614637 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5614638 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5614639 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5614640 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy to use its military capability to damage and in some cases destroy georgian infrastructure and to try and weaken the georgian state
5614641 we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the transatlantic structures
5614642 to clearly indicate that we are not accepting a new line
5614643 is a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5614644 this is not something that is just cost free nobody needs russian strategic aviation along americas coast
5614645 an explanation from the russians for why the russian president either wont or cant keep his word
5614646 it didnt take that long for the russian forces to get in and it really shouldnt take that long for them to get out
5614647 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5614648 i am sure that such a well conducted effective peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military
5614649 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly
5614650 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5614651 i wish more of our guys would play like that up here
5614652 its not their custom to play like that in china hey thats the way we play it in america i like seeing it the old thing you hear about nice guys they finish last
5614653 im sure it was frustrating for him to see all the other young guys called up to the big leagues i hope he understands why
5614654 probably the most positive thing is to watch all those young guys get called up and not let it affect his state of mind
5614655 if youre not going to be called up to the big leagues its nice to have the olympic experience
5614656 now this whole musharraf excuse is behind us now people are going to be focusing on their performance
5614657 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5614658 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5614659 the government had been blaming musharraf for inflation power cuts and the weak economy and since now he has resigned we hope that the government will take steps to make our life better
5614660 selling our innocent brothers and sisters to america for dollars
5614661 his resignation clears the way for our government to get on with providing to the people of pakistan basic social services economic opportunities political security and law and order
5614662 its a huge challenge and they cannot face it individually its very important for them to work together and i think they know that
5614663 america wants some immediate decisions on fighting terrorism and i dont think they will be able to concentrate on that
5614664 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual
5614665 whatever one might say it may be difficult for the politicians to give him the indemnity
5614666 my colon was damaged due to radiation i received 17 years ago but ive been on a medication called lomotil it controls b ms but unfortunately not all the time i have had my shear of accidents so i can relate to marks story when he was up on the lift and had an accident you see my problem is also with my sphincter the anal muscle that holds everything up and in because of the cancer they had to removed a large portion so i have no control of any b ms i cant even feel when im having one ive been surviving because of the medication it hasnt been pleasant i need my life back so i have to go for the permanent ostomy
5614667 its not a terrible thing that we feel fear when faced with the unknown it is part of being alive something we all share fear is a natural reaction to moving closer to the truth no one ever tells us to stop running away from fear we are rarely told to move closer to just be there to become familiar with fear so next time you encounter fear consider youself lucky this is where the courage comes in usually we think that brave people have no fear the truth is that they are intimate with fear the trick is to keep exploring and not bail out even when we find out that something is not what we though thats what were going to discover again and agian and again nothing is what we thought

5614673 the character seems to be developing a little bit which is always nice for a secondary character
5614674 it seems like lorne instead of just being shepherds right hand man his military career is progressing so it feels less like a subservient kind of role on atlantis now and a bit more like i wont say an equal but a somewhat authoritative role so im kinda running my own show which is a neat way for lorne to go more so this year than any others anyway i feel like his career is sort of moving ahead
5614675 in all honesty im absolutely perplexed im absolutely shocked that just goes to show the type of fans that follow this show hes a minor character ive done a fair number of episodes and i try to do what i can with them im not always given a ton of material to create a connection with the audience but theyre really embracing the character as it is im just like man imagine where i could go if they gave me some more stuff to work on
5614676 that was the single best film experience ive had from top to bottom that show for me was so fulfilling and empowering and enjoyable im by nature quite a shy reclusive kinda guy i spend most of my time reading except now i have a son so that part of my life doesnt exist anymore but i used to read all the time that was it i wasnt very social and i dont generally hang out with actors that much but on that show i bonded with everybody immediately we went out the whole cast for dinner every single night and we shot for about five or six weeks and we were so tight on that show todd holland the director and rand ravich who wrote and produced were such a joy to work with
5614677 about half way through todd and all the producers from fox called me into the trailer and i thought i was being canned they sat me down and they were like we just want you to know the show wouldnt be nearly as good without you and if we get picked up youre on it full time and that was so confidence boosting it really boosted my morale to get that kinda feedback was such a pleasure then when we finished that project we were almost assured by fox that it was getting a pick up
5614678 what i heard the reasons why it didnt get picked up in the end was that the powers that be at fox thought it would fly over the heads of too many people that and the budget was a tad on the high side i think back then they were looking at 1 9 to 2 an episode and for not having any star power on the show they thought the budget was too high so they tried to cut some things and by the time they came in with a decent budget fox had gotten behind joss whedons project and really gone full blow with that and they dropped time tunnel
5614679 watching the show theres a scene where a bomber flies overhead and a war scene that we get transplanted into that was so fantastic the quality was so great when i saw that i was like oh my god if this gets picked up its going to be like this every week i got a little ahead of myself its the only time in my career that ive actually let myself get just a tad bit excited i was really looking forward to that show going and then in the end it didnt happen and i know better now maybe it would have found a place now because of the things are more along that vein but back then they decided to go in a different direction which to this day is one of my biggest let downs
5614680 yesterday for example my day consisted of maybe 15 lines of fairly straight forward dialogue and i got to shoot a machine gun for about three hours and you know for a kid i guess even for a gal too but stereotypically for a boy that is playing that is just playing i would never shoot a real gun its not my thing but shooting these things is really enjoyable it is the best way to get rid of stress its really empowering in a bizarre and kinda twisted way but its a lot of fun and to get together with these guys every day when i come to this show its so familial its so friendly and warm i could have like three or four episodes off come back and every single person on set is like hey kav how ya doin hows the kid hows so and so and so i think some of that sense of fun and camaraderie translates to the screen
5614681 when i got the invitation for the 100th episode party i was shocked im like whoa i guess it just sorta creeps up on you out of nowhere 100 episodes maybe maybe three percent of tv shows go that long but it does seem like my first season was just yesterday
5614682 jeg finder det rystende at folk bruger min fars navn fem r efter hans d d og tilskriver ham tro idealer v rdier og loyalitet der af gode grunde ikke kan bekr ftes i et fors ge p at fremme deres egne dagsordener
5614683 jeg kendte min far ganske godt i hvert fald bedre end nogle af dem der g r krav p at dele hans arv og hans formodede idealer og selv jeg ville ikke vove offentligt at udtale mig om hvad jeg tror han t nkte eller f lte dette er is r farligt n r det bliver blandet sammen med et politisk tilh rsforhold
5614684 det er uretf rdigt og p tr ngende at bruge hans navn til at st tte en hvilken som helst platform jeg beder om at min far ikke bliver indblandet i dette valg fra nogen som helst politisk side da han tydeligvis ikke er her for at forsvare eller give sin egen mening til kende

5614722 no hay a n se ales de retirada en absoluto
5614723 la retirada de las fuerzas rusas ya se ha iniciado por supuesto que habr que esperar unos d as para llevar a cabo el plan de paz de seis puntos
5614724 la retirada completa depende de la pol tica de mijail saakashvili el presidente georgiano y de lo que hagan sus fuerzas
5614725 tienen mandato internacional se encuentran all de manera leg tima y deben permanecer para mantener la paz
5614726 industriproduktionen r negativ och under andra kvartalet hade vi i stort nolltillv xt i sverige
5614727 detta b r vara toppen f r producentprisinflationen men det r alltf r tidigt f r ecb att bl sa faran ver banken r fortfarande oroad ver spridningseffekter fr n tidigare pris kningar och kommer att ligga stilla under versk dlig framtid
5614728 det finns en k nsla att en v ndpunkt kan vara inom r ckh ll
5614729 we have heard about suicide bombers on foot they are receiving indirect rocket and artillery fire
5614730 our commando units were deployed into the area and engaged the attackers and pushed them back
5614731 so far 13 attackers have been killed six blew themselves up six others died in the explosions and one died in gunfire from commandos their bodies have been recovered
5614732 the operation was launched approximately 12 30 local time overnight by the fighters and was aimed to storm the military base
5614733 they were not able to storm the base and were pushed back according to the governor of khost province and are now said to be hiding out in corn fields and civilian homes
5614734 they were fired at we have found six bodies which were all wearing suicide vests
5614735 some of them have blown themselves up others are hiding in nearby houses and corn fields the troops are searching for them
5614736 we are against cruelty we are against ethnic cleansing a right to come back home should be guaranteed to the refugees we all agree that murders property destruction annihilation of culture and religion are not to be tolerated that is what we are fighting against bombardments of the aggressor will be mercilessly intensified
5614737 we appeal to all free countries to join us but our actions are not determined by others i will defend the freedom and security of my citizens whatever actions are needed for it our special forces have seized airports and bridges air forces and missiles have struck essential targets
5614738 eu posso ainda n o ter comido o rei mas minha rainha e os dois cavalos j dominam o centro do tabuleiro
5614739 unternehmer wagen sich aus angst vor einer neiddebatte auch mit ihrer wohlt tigkeit nicht aus der anonymit t dabei k nnten gerade sie ein vorbild f r andere spender und sponsoren sein
5614740 in einem ordnungsrahmen der sowohl scharfen wettbewerb wie auch sozialen ausgleich sichert kann dieses streben nach pers nlichem wohlergehen zugleich zum wohlstand aller f hren
5614741 gerechte anspr che schaffung und sicherung gerechter teilhabe durch gewerkschaften ein beitrag aus evangelischer sicht
5614742 the idea is to get energy relief money as well as the permanent fund dividend before winter hits so people have their money to offset the astronomical costs we are seeing for energy
5614743 das milit r setzt kampfhubschrauber ein um sie die islamisten zu eliminieren
5614744 doch manchmal treffen sie dabei mehr zivilisten als taliban das macht b ses blut bei der lokalen bev lkerung und die regierung sollte dieses problem ernster nehmen
5614745 die situation in unseren stammesgebieten ist vergleichbar mit der afghanistans vor dem 11 september staatliche autorit t in diesen regionen existiert praktisch nicht militante die in pakistan wie auch afghanistan k mpfen kontrollieren jetzt dieses gebiet
5614746 theres a lack of well paying jobs in the area
5614747 when folks have a chance to move on they move on
5614748 teachers pay more attention to people messing around than people who want to learn
5614749 the only way to make money is selling dope on the corner
5614750 it gives a really powerful message that if youre not in school were going to your home
5614751 most of the time we find dropouts not working and not happy with life
5614752 education is truly an equalizer i want our youngsters to have that opportunity
5614753 allt bara stannade jag kommer aldrig att gl mma det
5614754 forts tt t vla efter 35 men med s nkt ambitionsniv
5614755 sverige r berett att hj lpa i den h r situationen
5614756 yes i have that problem tell me how you will help me fix it
5614757 let me point out and i am closing with this
5614758 i love the fraternity brothers because theyre so young and such a contrasting team
5614759 one takes his time to think things out the other one loves to rush and go at a million miles an hour theres definitely tension between the two of them while theyre making decisions during the race
5614760 they are small we wanted to make sure that there wasnt anything to prevent us from putting that pack underneath the seat in front of us when we got on a plane we didnt want something to happen where we got delayed because of our luggage we thought that would help us go faster
5614761 we did extensive research on what to wear what was lightweight and would help us move the fastest
5614762 i think it was the longest i ever went without wearing a logo on my t shirt
5614763 we both tried to do some training along the lines of going down to our little gym but that was pretty much it
5614764 we have an emerging farm so we do a lot of work out there splitting wood and taking care of the horses
5614765 people were a little afraid we were going to pull a borat on them i told them we werent doing borat but what happened there is very very funny its not easy to shoot in places like that because they practically have no television industry
5614766 the teams have no idea how to get from point a to point b there
5614767 they dont know the language its very difficult to get through this country they get so stuck but they find so many fascinating solutions of how to get through everything one of the things the teams do there is go to a real life floating village its insane
5614768 were just happy to continue making the show as it is
5614769 es gibt solche gespr che aber es sind nur gespr che aber ich sage nicht dass keine tatsachen dahinter stehen
5614770 die kubaner haben lange auf uns gewartet meiner meinung nach warten sie auch heute auf uns sie werden wahrscheinlich keinen einwand erheben wenn wir wieder elektronische berwachungsanlagen auf dem st tzpunkt in lourdes errichten oder irgendetwas anderes tun
5614771 wenn wir diese nicht haben dann werden wir in die strategischen spiele der anderen hineingezogen denn der planet von heute ist in kraftfelder aufgeteilt in dem die interessen von l ndern blocks und koalitionen miteinander verflochten sind wir brauchen ein system eigener st tzpunkte im ausland eine solche pr senz bietet ein effektiveres und stabileres sicherheitssystem
5614772 die us regierung muss die russen ganz klar wissen lassen dass ein solcher schritt bedeuten w rde dass eine fest umrissene schwelle berschritten wird dass sie ber eine rote linie gehen
5614773 wir m ssen unsere stellung nicht nur in kuba sondern auch in anderen l ndern wiederherstellen
5614774 russland bestrebt ist ein multipolares system internationaler beziehungen zu schaffen
5614775 der westen sein monopol auf den prozess der globalisierung verloren hat
5614776 russland ist wirklich st rker geworden und in der lage eine wichtige verantwortung f r die l sung regionaler und globaler probleme zu bernehmen
5614777 alle versuche nationale oder gruppeninteressen auf kosten des internationalen rechts durchzusetzen zu erkennen und manchmal einfach zur ckzuweisen
5614778 ziele darauf ab dem westen umfassende garantien beiderseitiger sicherheit anzubieten
5614779 die bedrohungen im 21 jahrhundert richten sich sowohl gegen russland als auch gegen den westen
5614780 wenn es im westen menschen gibt die verstehen dass sie sich ohne russland nicht gegen diese bedrohungen verteidigen k nnen dann werden wir eine bereinkunft erzielen
5614781 die aufstellung der us raketenabwehr in osteuropa ist ein l ngerfristiger prozess
5614782 und wenn das heute eine sehr umstrittene bedrohung f r russland ist dann k nnte sie morgen oder bermorgen wirklichkeit werden deshalb m ssen wir schon jetzt asymmetrische ma nahmen ergreifen um die bedrohung zu verringern und das prinzip der garantierten nuklearen erwiderung aufrechterhalten man kann sich nicht verstecken es ist genau dieser hypothetische schlag der der eckpfeiler der russisch amerikanischen beziehungen im bereich der strategischen abschreckung bleibt
5614783 liegt ganz europa mit seinen amerikanischen milit rst tzpunkten in rum nien bulgarien und den atomwaffen in deutschland in unserer reichweite
5614784 die opposition kann im herbst gegen die finanziaria demonstrieren wie sie will aber genau so gut k nnte sie gegen den hagel demonstrieren
5614785 es wird zu wenig ber das politische projekt diskutiert alle sagen man m sse rifondazione retten aber wenn ein prek r besch ftigter oder ein student zu unseren kongressen k me w rde er sich fragen warum rifondazione eigentlich gerettet werden soll
5614786 squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5614787 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5614788 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5614789 judges can punish men who force their daughters to marry like this
5614790 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5614791 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5614792 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5614793 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5614794 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5614795 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5614796 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5614797 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5614798 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5614799 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5614800 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5614801 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5614802 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5614803 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5614804 do you have any problems where is your family do your children go to school
5614805 the progress has been smooth and all the four bases will be completed by the year end
5614806 their total capacity will amount to 16 4 million cu m
5614807 coal burning leaves toxic heavy metal legacy in the arctic
5614808 conventional wisdom held that toxic heavy metals were higher in the 1960s and 70s the peak of industrial activity in europe and north america and certainly before implementation of clean air act controls in the early 1970s
5614809 but it turns out pollution in southern greenland was higher 100 years ago when north american and european economies ran on coal before the advent of cleaner more efficient coal burning technologies and the switch to oil and gas based economies
5614810 contamination of other sectors may be increasing because of the rapid coal driven growth of asian economies
5614811 the law grants the military wide powers to arrest without warrant shoot to kill and destroy property in so called disturbed areas it also protects military personnel responsible for serious crimes from prosecution creating a pervasive culture of impunity
5614812 the afspa was enacted by parliament with a view to quelling the naga insurgency in 1958 but after that there were so many insurgencies in the northeast and despite the act in force in all the insurgency hit states yet militancy is thriving in other words the afspa had miserably failed
5614813 i am not going to withdraw my fast until this black act is repealed in its totality from manipur
5614814 if timely action is not taken to repeal the act the northeast would be in turmoil

5614818 historians will not forgive musharraf he manipulated elections he hounded his opponents and he became a dictator its not much of a legacy
5614819 there will be a more balanced view of him in the future than there is now
5614820 a lot of things happened in pakistan for the good under his watch and i think that is something the history books will recall after some time
5614821 as far as democracy in pakistan is concerned historians will not forgive him says senator enver beg of the pakistan peoples party
5614822 he manipulated elections he hounded his opponents and he became a dictator its not much of a legacy
5614823 he never tried to create an impression in pakistan that we were fighting for our own country and our own good
5614824 and because of that the pakistan army became a client army and pakistan became a client state in the eyes of the people it was a major failing on his part
5614825 the overall sentiment is weak due to falling oil prices
5614826 this is due to a combination of extremely high oil prices which represent the majority of the sites costs and lower nickel mni0 prices
5614827 the resumption of activities will be assessed based on market conditions which are expected to improve towards the end of 2008
5614828 the suspension will also enable the acceleration of feasibility studies into the energy conversion project to switch the operations power source from oil to coal and the development of the loma miranda project which will provide a new higher grade mining area for falcondo and extend the mine life
5614829 all these results bode well for the commercialisation and development process which has commenced with a number of overseas and australian parties formerly expressing interest in participating in the further development of mt oxide

5614835 it would have been nice to win a medal but i am just happy to have achieved a personal best time
5614836 the public expected us to win medals we knew before we came here we wouldnt win any
5614837 the parties agreed to continue the political dialogue between themselves and refrain from making inflammatory statements
5614838 they strongly condemn the perpetrators as well as those who mastermind and fund violence which targets innocent people including killings indiscriminate shelling looting raping and acts of piracy

5614840 if the rot of bad science continues to spread to be tolerated and even to be rewarded by corporations and centrally administered government grants the heyday of scientific and technological achievement is inevitably drawing to its end in north america
5614841 in the past scientists have written their reports said this is what the science is and the policymakers made their decisions from it
5614842 decisions that come out of fish and wildlife ignore the science and fabricate evidence in the crudest most unsophisticated way
5614843 it works best when read by a leighton type reader affecting a carribbean accent accompanied by a feynman impersonator on bongos
5614844 your conduct has been excellent according to security standards and you are a hard worker with you as a member you have always completed your work and assignments however you are not displaying the growth needed to remain in the program your focus is not on god and his son to change you

5614848 assistance directly to a broad class of citizens who in turn direct government aid to religious
5614849 wholly as a result of their own genuine and independent private choice
5614850 the incidental advancement of a religious mission or the perceived endorsement of a religious message is reasonably attributable to the individual recipient not to the government whose role ends with the disbursement of benefits
5614851 available generally without regard to the sectarian nonsectarian or public nonpublic nature of the institution benefited
5614852 promoted peace and understanding advocated nonviolence fought for social justice thats a pretty good record but it says here you believed in one of those wrong religions so have fun in the lake of fire
5614853 oh theyre afraid the boys will be rowdy or misbehave because they havent been taught any rules or something
5614854 i guess character matters more than what you believe about god

5614859 it is important now that we proceed as quickly as possible with these flood relief measures
5614860 if we dont have any more heavy rain we reckon we will be able to completely pump centaur street within the next few hours
5614861 but theres nothing anybody can do if we have the same excessive weather that we have had over the last few days
5614862 overall it will be changeable but the rainfall wont be as torrential as weve seen
5614863 the flooding in carlow will ease gradually and the situation should be improving
5614864 with chip and pin now fully implemented in ireland and many countries across europe there are fewer places where the fraudsters can use the fake cards
5614865 cardholders should not be concerned as anyone who may suffer a loss due to the fraud will be reimbursed by their bank or card company
5614866 the payments industry body is extremely concerned about these fraud attacks and ensures that all appropriate action is being taken
5614867 in the meantime banking industry fraud monitoring systems will continue to work to detect where fraud is taking place
5614868 if customers feel concerned that their card has been compromised they should report their suspicions to their bank

5614873 mr johnson who holds a general science degree from west point also suggests that since slime snake monkey people insist they evolved over millions of years through a countless series of random mutations christians should also refer to them as mutants

5614893 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
5614894 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
5614895 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

5614964 i had my doubts this would happen after the fire
5614965 this solidifies for me why we liked going to sweetwater it was the employees the way they interpreted their jobs their hearts were in the right place
5614966 it was an effort by our company to say sweetwater doesnt exist right now but its time to come together as a community to help a child in need

5615042 na mijn vierde plek op de rekstok op het wk van 2007 moest ik slechts vormbehoud tonen en dat is nu gelukt maar om eerlijk te zijn kon er weinig mis gaan om de limiet van 15 000 punten te halen alleen valpartijen konden mijn olympische droom dwarsbomen
5615043 in januari begon de ellende ik kreeg steeds meer pijn een deur openen was al te veel gevraagd en ik maakte me grote zorgen ontstoken zenuwen bleek het euvel en volgens de specialist moesten de zenuwen binnen tien weken herstellen mocht dat niet het geval zijn dan kon ik wel fluiten naar peking
5615044 het lijkt me wel stoer als er straks in het internationale turnen over de zonderland wordt gesproken dat zou een door mij bedachte oefening zijn waarin je niet een tweedubbel gehurkte maar zelfs een driedubbel gehurkte salto moet doen
5615045 ik ga daar flink op trainen alleen is het risico veel te groot om dat op de spelen voor het eerst in wedstrijdverband te doen daarnaast is mijn oefening de zogenaamde kovacs kolman met dus die tweedubbel gehurkte salto al aardig gewaagd ik ben momenteel zelfs de enige in de wereld die deze combinatie maakt mijn uitgangswaarde is al erg hoog en meer dan voldoende om daar hoge ogen te gooien mits ik geen fouten maak
5615046 met trillende handjes heb je niets op het hoogste niveau te zoeken gelukkig heb ik daar bijna nooit last van de gezonde wedstrijdspanning zorgt er zelfs voor dat ik boven mezelf uit kan stijgen op het moment supr me sommige jongens falen dan juist omdat het hen niet lukt te ontspannen of de concentratie vast te houden iets wat cruciaal is bij turnen
5615047 ik had bij de pakken neer kunnen gaan zitten maar dat zit niet in mijn aard
5615048 het probleem met mijn schouder is nog niet opgelost maar ik heb er iets op bedacht weet je hoe moeilijk het is voor een rechtsbenige voetballer om met links te spelen nou zo is het met de rekstok ook toch heb ik mezelf in een paar maanden tijd geleerd om van een rechtspoot een linksbenige speler te worden om dat beeld vast te houden twee elementen uit mijn oefening doe ik nu niet meer met links maar juist met rechts hoe trainen trainen en nog eens trainen zo omzeil ik mijn nog altijd niet herstelde blessure door mijn talent voor gevoel co rdinatie en bewegen kon ik me zo snel aanpassen pas na de spelen zal mijn schouder zich weer herstellen
5615049 maar ik doe niet mee voor de troostprijzen ik houd me vast aan mijn vierde stek op het wk vorig jaar daar draaide ik met de top mee en waarom zou ik dat in peking n et kunnen door de blessure kom ik echter alleen uit op de rekstok en moet ik de meerkamp mijn specialisatie laten schieten ik heb dus een kans en die moet raak zijn
5615050 met mijn twee ntwintig jaartjes heb ik de ideale leeftijd om voor het eerst naar de olympische spelen te gaan lukt het nu niet dan wacht over vier jaar londen nog
5615051 aan de buitenkant zie je niet dat ik een gelovige jongen ben ook tref je me niet elke zondag in een kerk aan simpelweg omdat ik daar geen tijd voor heb maar het geloof zoals ik dat van mijn ouders heb meegekregen speelt op de achtergrond zeker een rol
5615052 ik zie ons zo weer zitten als gezinnetje mijn ouders geeske en mijn twee oudere broers johan en herre halverwege de dienst mochten wij naar het knutselkwartiertje en dat brak de lange zit een beetje toch ben ik de kerk nooit gaan zien als een kooi waar ik uit wilde ontsnappen wel verdween het kerkbezoek langzamerhand naar de achtergrond doordat mijn broers en ik op steeds hoger niveau gingen turnen
5615053 als ik naar deze wereld kijk kan ik me niet voorstellen dat er geen god is dat is helemaal geen vraag voor me hij is altijd bij me ook gedurende wedstrijden soms bid ik op spannende momenten kort tot hem en dat geeft rust sta je goed in het leven heb je iets over voor andere mensen dan krijg je dat op de een of andere manier van hem terug stiekem hoop ik wel eens dat hij me terugbetaalt met uitmuntende prestaties in de turnhal natuurlijk moet ik mezelf tot het uiterste dwingen voor mijn sport maar wat zou het mooi zijn als hij me straks in peking zon knipoog geeft
5615054 ik merk dat het sinds mijn nominatie voor de spelen een enorme vlucht heeft genomen ongestoord winkelen in lemmer is er niet meer bij alleen al het beantwoorden van allerlei e mails aanvragen voor sponsoring en andere ditjes en datjes slurpt veel tijd op gelukkig ondervangt een goede vriend van mijn ouders dit nu grotendeels hij is mijn manager ja ik heb door schade en schande geleerd dat mijn grootste valkuil is overal ja op te zeggen ik vind alles prachtig dus dan vergeet je snel de juiste prioriteiten te stellen
5615055 ik vraag me alleen vaak af waarom een dag maar 24 uur heeft man dat vind ik zo frustrerend om me volledig op de spelen te kunnen richten heb ik mijn studie dit jaar op een lager pitje gezet en dat geeft rust maar dat een sportcarri re niet eeuwig duurt weet ik ook wel het lijkt me prachtig om na een tijdje de deur van de sport dicht te doen en me volledig in de medische wereld te storten ik wil heel graag chirurg worden het echte handwerk h je kunt dan heel concreet iets betekenen voor je medemens dat spreek me aan niet dat ik n zo ego stisch in het leven sta al kan dat best handig zijn als topsporter maar ik voel me prettig als er mensen om me heen zijn ik ben een mensen mens ook al heb ik veel te weinig tijd om leuke dingen te doen met vrienden en familie

5615062 omg is someone taking a crap now i can smell it hell im sure they can smell it all the way from china shit this stinks pun intended
5615063 why is giving on the decline in virtually every church in america is the culprit the economy
5615064 economic downturns do make religious people more conscientious about how they invest their resources when employers freeze wageswhen prices are higher you should expect the coffers tol be lighter but the economy has little to do with the decline in the number of coins that ring in coffers even when our economy was booming giving was waning giving has been declining for decades
5615065 a more important question is what motivates generosity why would any person give anything at all
5615066 generosity is never tied to circumstances but to convictions if the economy had anything to do with giving the macedonians about whom saint paul wrote in sacred scripture had every reason to quarantine the meager resources they did have instead however their generosity was outlandish
5615067 just as in macedonia this kind of outlandish generosity exists today
5615068 but it isnt because of sermons on tithing or the pulpit scolding of those who do not give motivation for giving must come from somewhere other than guilt for not giving or shame for giving too little
5615069 you never have to beg from people who have experienced grace
5615070 but you almost always have to beg from those who have not
5615071 if there is a decline in giving in church look for a deficit of grace in peoples lives
5615072 it is there youll find the answers for what motivates giving grace is the key that unlocks generosity
5615073 if you can make it here you can make it anywhere
5615074 the first cd im doing is called stress its all in the mind through my growing up as an athlete i was always taught to be positive its kind of ingrained in me

5615076 i feel having become a citizen in 2005 and the way the world feels about america at the moment theres a lot of negativity in the world about america being the big bully from my point of view as an immigrant ive put it onto cd how i see it through my eyes
5615077 we both had a discussion about how americans are truly a great people and they dont deserve to be hated by all the other countries so we thought we would be the best people to share that not everyone in the world hates americans we wanted to speak on behalf of non americans who recognize the contributions americans have made to the world they have done so much for the world in advances in technology and then there is the support america has provided for other countries after natural disasters how quickly the world forgets so this is our way of saying thank you to the american people

5615090 a user reports that certain ingredients can be found in a store and comments on the quality of those ingredients we then take everything we know about those ingredients to create a profile of the store this allows us to recommend ingredients that have not been directly reported there and give users a more complete picture of the stores merchandise
5615091 we know that most of the ingredients in a store will never be reported
5615092 so it is important to be able to use the reported data create more information from them and returns a more useful set of information back to our users

5615125 since the foreign ministers office responded to our invitation to join us and said that we have good intentions we now fully expect to reach gaza

5615127 only 43 5 of basic commercial food import needs were met during the period between 3 and 30 december 2007
5615128 the stranglehold on gazas borders has made the work of the un and other humanitarian agencies virtually impossible only a trickle of medicine food fuel and other goods is being allowed in the israeli blockade of gaza has made people highly dependent on food aid and brought the health system and basic services such as water and sanitation near to collapse

5615136 at the start of the season its always very difficult to assess how good players like denilson and johan djourou will be they can only develop if they play its a tricky situation people want to see big names and they want to see good young players as well
5615137 the world is witnessing a digital information deluge the sheer volume and complexity of the information generated and replicated everyday has thrown up a plethora of challenges for organisations worldwide but the industry lacks the right kind of infrastructure and resource pool to tackle this situation in an efficient way our estimate says that there is a requirement of 1 million skilled information storage professionals by 2012 we are certain that this partnership with national institute of technology warangal will go a long way in helping us address this issue of storage knowledge gap existing in the industry

5615144 already there are advocates saying that injection sites are not enough that government should hand out heroin for free
5615145 others are now calling for inhalation rooms for people who smoke their drugs while i support various aspects of harm reduction i believe that we have to draw the line somewhere with regard to these kinds of measures
5615146 is it ethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
5615147 in this way the supervised injection site undercuts the ethics of medical practice and sets a debilitating example for all physicians and nurses both present and future in canada who might begin to question whether its ok to allow someone to overdose under their care
5615148 we specifically take issue with the minister using that phrase
5615149 the minister was off base in calling into question the ethics of physicians involved in harm reduction
5615150 its clear that this was being used as a political issue
5615151 i found the use of medical ethics to justify a political decision which will affect social policy to be troubling at best and misleading at worst
5615152 ethics consist of a balancing of rights and harms as do all medical decisions that physicians in this room help their patients reach every day iv drug users as the rest of us have the right to compassion and to access and care which has proven to be beneficial
5615153 if theyre infected with west nile where they have west nile fever or they have west nile virus meningitis or encephalitis these data can tell them what to expect that gradually over about a year their mental and physical function generally and on average will return to normal
5615154 i think at least it helps patients and physicians and their families to know what to expect over time
5615155 i had to learn how to start all over again walking you name it
5615156 whats interesting and what surprised us was the fact that there seems to be a lot of resiliency in individuals who had the encephalitis or meningitis or the milder symptoms

5615164 said roy louis an adviser with the samson first nation
5615165 it is up to us the four nations people we need to work together to come up with a long term solutions against the gangs the drugs and the violence but our community has to take charge
5615166 these communities have to recognize that they have a problem with some of these young people that are out there with their gang ties and this lifestyle with drugs and the violence and they can go home to grandma and grandma will accept them and love them unconditionally kamins said
5615167 well the grandmas and other community leaders have to stop and say wait a minute
5615168 the hardened criminals and the entrenched gang members are committing these crimes and they are committing violence and they are hurting the community terribly
5615169 we have to balance that on the other hand with the fact that we have a lot of people involved in gangs who may be rehabilitated
5615170 they are our people they are our children they are our community members our relatives and it may look simple and easy from someone on the outside but to us it isnt that simple
5615171 i am here to tell you today as chief of samson cree nation we are going to reclaim our youth and foster security within our community these young people are our future

5615231 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5615232 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5615233 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5615234 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

5615237 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones

5615241 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5615242 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
5615243 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5615244 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5615245 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5615246 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5615247 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5615248 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5615249 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5615250 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5615251 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5615252 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5615253 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5615254 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5615255 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5615256 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5615257 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5615258 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5615259 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5615260 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5615261 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5615262 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5615263 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

5615267 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
5615268 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5615269 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5615270 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
5615271 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

5615274 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5615275 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5615276 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5615277 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5615278 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5615279 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5615280 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5615281 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5615282 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5615283 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5615284 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5615285 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5615286 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5615287 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena

5615331 ich stehe nicht so auf diese massenveranstaltungen das gegr le finde ich anstrengend ich bin immer froh dass ich bei meinen konzerten auf der b hne stehe und nicht davor
5615332 es ist nicht so toll dass ich der meinung bin dass man an einer beziehung nicht arbeiten kann so werde ich mein leben lang wieder an diesen punkt kommen an dem ich wei man hat sich alles gesagt alle themen sind durch alle leidenschaft ist weg es wird nie wieder etwas aufflammen

5615343 developing our oil sands has had its environmental challenges but weve come a long way
5615344 we will also be introducing tough new regulations that will require even more dramatic cuts
5615345 we tried the inside approach to bringing about change and the government has said yup we hear what youre saying and we agree that these are the problems and yet they havent been willing to step up
5615346 we feel weve exhausted the possibility of working within cema to bring about changes
5615347 i dont think what pembina is saying is that cema does bad scientific work
5615348 i think pembinas frustration and the frustration of the first nations and the frustration of a lot of members is the politics that when things come out it seems to take a long time to see a result
5615349 the whole issue of north american energy security coupled with responsible environmental stewardship are the flip sides of the same issue
5615350 the oil sands are critical to north american energy security and its important that we explain not only to the americans but internationally the responsible way in which those developments are going to unfold
5615351 these communities have to recognize that they have a problem with some of these young people that are out there with their gang ties and this lifestyle with drugs and the violence and they can go home to grandma and grandma will accept them and love them unconditionally chief supt kamins said
5615352 well the grandmas and other community leaders have to stop and say wait a minute
5615353 the hardened criminals and the entrenched gang members are committing these crimes and they are committing violence and they are hurting the community terribly
5615354 we have to balance that on the other hand with the fact that we have a lot of people involved in gangs who may be rehabilitated they are our people they are our children they are our community members our relatives and it may look simple and easy from someone on the outside but to us it isnt that simple
5615355 en todos estoy d as de concentraci n estoy sintiendo un equipo muy unido en sinton a con esp ritu de victoria y nada de celos entre los jugadores
5615356 brasil lo hizo mal ante camer n pero argentina tampoco lo hizo bien ante holanda adem s hace tiempo que brasil no pierde con argentina algo que no es decisivo pero s indicativo
5615357 es m s un feeling que una opini n fundamentada pero creo que ganar brasil
5615358 argentina va a ganar por dos razones por un lado tiene m s jugadores con capacidad de decidir en brasil s lo est ronaldinho el resto son proyectos de futbolistas y muy pocos formar an parte de la selecci n absoluta no como en la albiceleste por otro argentina tendr m s ganas de vencer porque ha perdido en los ltimos enfrentamientos contra brasil
5615359 si argentina juega lo que sabe especialmente messi ganar y puede incluso golear
5615360 ah puede estar la clave en parar a messi tambi n a juan rom n riquelme creo que dunga colocar a hernanes y lucas sobre ellos
5615361 im in a state of shock and the thought of looking like this at 57 is terrifying
5615362 having seen these images i can honestly say i am never going to use a sunbed again
5615363 you can so easily get brown from a bottle these days there is just no point in ruining your looks and risking skin cancer by using sunbeds
5615364 i hope the horrible image of me will make other young people think twice before they next use a sunbed
5615365 we want to provide young people with a shocking visual representation of how sunbeds and over exposure to the sun can dramatically affect the way you look further down the line
5615366 while young people may be using sunbeds as they think they make them look good now in the long term they are doing serious damage to their looks
5615367 the lettings market is booming with many vendors opting to rent their property while sales in the housing market continue to dry up
5615368 many are willing to hold and await the return of capital appreciation becoming a landlord is now an increasingly profitable option with rising rents and yields offering good returns
5615369 established investors have been reaping the benefits of the housing downturn for sometime and will continue to do so in the short term however ever increasing supply could have an impact on rental growth as tenant options increase
5615370 our thoughts are with all of those involved and their families
5615371 were currently carrying out enquiries into how this crash happened gathering evidence from the scene and speaking to witnesses
5615372 this is likely to take some time given the nature of the incident and the diverse background of those involved
5615373 we have a number of interpreters helping us and our officers are currently liaising with the relevant embassies to keep them fully informed
5615374 at this point id like to take this opportunity to thank all of the responding agencies and alton towers for their support
5615375 our priority later this morning is to examine the bus
5615376 officers from our collision investigation unit will be at the scene along with specialist vehicle examiners from vosa
5615377 once these thorough investigations have been completed the bus will be removed using specialist equipment
5615378 station road in alton will remain closed until the removal operation is safely finished all we can say at this stage is that this is likely to be some time today
5615379 we apologise for any inconvenience this causes to local residents and alton towers visitors and would encourage those planning a trip later today to check the latest travel news or alton towers website
5615380 our thoughts are with the family and friends of the deceased and the injured
5615381 our crews have worked extremely hard in difficult circumstances and alongside the police and paramedics have helped rescue the occupants of the coach
5615382 they are now working with a specialist heavy rescue team who have been called in to support the operation to recover the coach
5615383 all the emergency services worked extremely well together in difficult circumstances
5615384 the accident occurred in a very difficult area to access with the coach ending up on its side down a steep embankment which hampered rescue attempts
5615385 west midlands ambulance service called upon a large number of resources to ensure that all patients received the best possible treatment as quickly as possible
5615386 unfortunately one person died but due to the scale and seriousness of the incident its fortunate indeed there were not more serious or indeed fatal casualties
5615387 we would also like to pay tribute to the operators of alton towers for providing a bus and facilities to help with the treatment of the casualties
5615388 12 or 15 young people standing there crying and with blood running down them
5615389 it just sounded like a clap of thunder i saw the coach flying through the garden and just dialled 999
5615390 we had a torrential downpour of rain just before it happened it was an accident waiting to happen
5615391 update releases integrate the previous major release with the latest service pack selected feature packs and new functionality because an update release is based on the previous major release customers can incorporate it into their environment without any additional testing beyond what would be required for a typical service pack any additional functionality provided by an update would be optional and thus not affect application compatibility or require customers to recertify or retest applications

5615406 independent research clearly demonstrates that the wave keyboard can help improve the comfort of your typing experience

5615408 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
5615409 roughly 58 per cent of the contestants we sent to athens in 2004 were educated at independent schools schools of a type that educate only seven per cent of the general population and in the past three olympics the independent sector has walked off with 45 per cent of the medals now there will be some who find that a sad fact a depressing commentary on the relative lack of investment in time and sporting facilities in our schools but let us look on the bright side what that statistic tells me is that there is a huge untapped reservoir of potential athletic genius in the maintained sector
5615410 is it any coincidence that most of our olympic champions were privately educated

5615446 i knew about zillow com a long time ago before the general public was made aware of it as soon as i heard about it i proceeded to try out the website and do a competitive market analysis of my own home they used comparables that were 10 15 miles away from my home they used houses twice the size and in a couple of cases 20 years older than my own home and sales that were older than 1 year further their evaluation came in 40 000 less than i knew my home was worth

5615500 i have an iq of 170 and my sister has an iq of 192 and my mother has an iq of 168 and my husband has an iq of 196 so why does my son have such a low iq
5615501 lady your son is probably smarter than all of you because he is likely the only one with a valid score but why dont you just go ahead and make him feel intellectually inferior for his whole childhood and let him grow up to resent you sounds like a good plan
5615502 thats a mental mistake he made right there its not a lack of effort
5615503 its one of those situations where he assumed weve talked about assumptions thats an assumption on his part thats part of his game weve got to get rid of
5615504 i think everybody in here will do everything possible to make sure it doesnt happen again its not in joes hands any more its in nobodys hands but ours

5615706 meu filho me havia prometido a medalha de ouro e ele o fez

5615712 am ende k nnen zehn interessant sein vielleicht aber auch 20
5615713 es ist ja bekannt dass wir mittlerweile auch in mittelzentren expandieren
5615714 from this winter that is from october end passengers travelling from delhi to helsinki and at least 12 other destinations in europe will get the advantage of morning flights
5615715 similarly our flights out of mumbai have also been pushed forward slightly to give the passengers a similar advantage
5615716 in the process we are temporarily having to reduce the frequency of our daily flights to new delhi by a day and to mumbai where we now operate six days a week to four days
5615717 we will also continue to be the fastest to ferry passengers to as many as 16 out of 38 destinations in europe what we will be unable to serve as we have been doing now is the mumbai new york sector because of the rescheduling
5615718 we certainly look forward to the review of the bilateral civil aviation pact between finland and india since we have been looking at two destinations very closely chennai and bangalore
5615719 we will reaffirm the commitment in bucharest and the meeting is also expected to approve a package of measures to support georgia
5615720 i think the allies are going to be firm that this was a violation of georgias territorial integrity

5615723 jesuss agenda is far bigger than just one or two issues we have to care about poverty we have to care about disease we have to care about illiteracy we have to care about corruption in government sex trafficking

5615727 the encouraging thing is that in 2004 we didnt have any part in the platform discussion
5615728 this time the party wanted us as a partner in the process they reached out to us and wanted to hear what we had to say

5615740 i tried to push it out with my foot but the man came back and slapped me he did not produce a card and took out a gun which he pointed at me then he sprayed pepper spray in my face

5615748 shawn ryan hat sich so seine gedanken gemacht wie er seine serie denn nun beenden wird denn er war in der beneidenswerten position dass sein sender the shield
5615749 ich habe in den vergangenen jahren die finals der serien genau beobachtet die mir gefallen hatten

5615754 thats way out of proportion for even the dramatically unpopular windows vista

5615756 the biggest challenge in integrating data is not just mapping bits and bytes but really understanding these systems
5615757 that domain expertise we dont have its in the heads of the community
5615758 salesforce can handle many calls it just doesnt want them to be large
5615759 the integration problem is a really terrific candidate for open source not only from the development side but the business perspective
5615760 been tuned mightily to move vast amounts of data to do all the things people need to do to build data warehouses for business intelligence
5615761 i see a lot more open source data integration vendors than customers today but do believe these tools can offer add value for certain types of customers
5615762 midmarket companies with less complex requirements and smaller budgets or departmental or project based initiatives within larger enterprises
5615763 a dedicated information assurance programme has been established for the coming year to address information risks and inspire public trust and confidence
5615764 this launch is just the start over time we will be expanding our offering even further with more suppliers who are at the forefront of laptop technology
5615765 unsere anwendungen sind darauf ausgerichtet it professionals bei ihrer t glichen arbeit zu unterst tzen und die verwaltung von komplexer unternehmens it so einfach wie m glich zu gestalten es freut uns deshalb besonders dass wir in diesem anliegen von so qualifizierter seite best tigt werden
5615766 the maltese proverb goes its better to know where you are than to know where you are going as you dont know what youll find when you get there i always want to be with a club who are challenging for the premier league title
5615767 if i cannot be with a title chasing club i will retire
5615768 i am pleased with our pre season form especially in both legs of the first qualifying round of the uefa champions league against slovakian champions fc artmedia petr alka
5615769 you cannot have the majority of players not being full professionals
5615770 this is the main reason why maltese football is lagging behind other nations especially at club level
5615771 i believe that there are quite a number of maltese players who could make the grade abroad
5615772 the fact that we come from a minnow nation makes it even harder for us to be taken on by foreign clubs
5615773 het pad is een onverharde weg tussen de breughelstraat en de willebrordusstraat en kronkelt tussen enkele weiden en ander groen
5615774 twee jaar geleden hebben we het gubelspad een straatnaambordje gegeven en sinds die opwaardering hebben wandelaars en joggers dit kleine verbindingspaadje weer ontdekt tot zij dus onlangs op die afspanning stootten
5615775 dat klopt maar dat geeft hem niet het recht om de boel af te sluiten het gaat om een weg die dateert uit minstens 1843 en staat geregistreerd in de offici le buurtwegenatlas het is dus een openbare weg niet zo gek heel wat neerpeltse wegen soms zelfs verharde wegen liggen op priv eigendom eigenaars zijn verplicht de toegang open te houden
5615776 the waves were tricky out there and i just looked for better potential ones
5615777 it kind of came my way then i tried to get a couple of big airs and completed them so it gave me some big scores
5615778 a large portion of those fish are still alive and moving and migrating and seeming to come out in a migratory corridor past halifax
5615779 it means that a lot of the fish are still alive that if there is massive mortality thats happening its not happening in the first part of their oceanic migration
5615780 for years scientists have struggled to understand the decline of atlantic salmon and what happens to them once they reach the ocean for the first time there is hope some answers will be found
5615781 the information has shown that while some salmon may die before reaching halifax many still survive
5615782 it passed me there on that small straight stretch and it was flying because i was doing 40 miles per hour 65 kilometres an hour and his vehicle went by me like i was stopped
5615783 my reaction at the time was whoever is driving ill be picking them up soon
5615784 i thought the truck wouldnt be staying on the road much longer
5615785 it was upside down it was 150 to 200 feet 45 to 60 metres down i had to go through a little brook and i eventually got to the truck and justin was at the back sitting on a snowbank and he was bleeding from his head
5615786 he was incoherent telling me there was two more people and i could hear colin screaming get me out of here and i could see bevs leg outside the truck but i could get no response from her colin was screaming get me out
5615787 gas was pouring out of the truck but my main focus was colin and if i could get colin out because he was still alive
5615788 there was no application of brakes prior to going into the ditch
5615789 there was 130 km h held that i took notice of
5615790 we used blankets to cover the truck to stop the wind and snow from getting into colin and bev
5615791 she was asleep and i remember waking up and i knew we were going too fast
5615792 he had no control over his truck the truck went over the shoulder and he cut back into the pavement and i felt the truck was going to flip so i managed to grab my wife next thing i knew she hit on the roof my left arm was under the cab my right arm was around her i couldnt get out
5615793 we heard people loud and clear that they didnt like that price last year
5615794 weve been getting a lot of good feedback to the idea
5615795 we want to make sure the exhibition is affordable to families because its all about family entertainment were hoping with the week pass people will be able to come and go more than once
5615796 sometimes i think we work on it so much to try to make it look as easy as we can its a tough play cause youve got to get the ball over if youre too far away from the bag youve got the pitcher covering or if you throw it youve still got to get back
5615797 when you have a pitcher covering a bag it never is normal
5615798 if its quick they need to get over there find the base and find the ball theyre not used to it
5615799 a lot of times they might have a stutter step and that can be the whole thing
5615800 you have to know what situation the game is youre trying to get two outs here or youre trying to get an out late in the game just to get outs
5615801 you have to judge how hard is the ball hit can you get one sometimes you dont want to rush the throw you want to make sure you get that one and if youre going to go to second make sure its a good throw so you at least get the one if you get two its a bonus speed of the ball speed of the runner it all dictates what youre doing
5615802 just one instance one step it almost feels like a little shock going up your back as soon as you realize what it is its too late
5615803 i just feel like the muscles stiff its grabbing my knee i think thats causing a little pain in the knee but not in the muscle
5615804 that was a good job of hitting youve got a guy hitting cleanup we dont want to take the bat out of their hands wed like to see them get him over and in but that was a great piece of hitting you could tell by his approach he was trying to get david at worst to third good way to play the game

5615812 but while obama has raised a third of a billion dollars his opponents have raised nothing they can either contribute now or pay later if we do not succeed obama will
5615813 obama has raised a third of a billion dollars to present his point of view
5615814 it is not enough to bellyache about obama as sean hannity does when obama is preparing to flood the united states with deceptive ads in september and october
5615815 i have devoted the profits from my book obama the man behind the mask to the anti obama movement
5615816 frankly i would be happy if the millions of obamas opponents gave to someone
5615817 mccain is accepting public funding for his campaign so he cannot engage in any more fund raising one he is nominated in a few days
5615818 now that mccain is showing he has a chance of winning obama is going to appeal for hundreds of millions of dollars more to drown out mccains message
5615819 we have a massive challenge ahead of us no one who says he opposes obama really oppose obama until he contributes money to his defeat
5615820 the task is not going to be easy unlike obama who is using dirty campaign finance techniques such as illegal contributions fat cats and bundling we have placed strict limits on contributions to the committee of one million if we can raise the money fairly and honestly we will do so if not then people will have to run the risk of four years of barack and michelle obama in the white house there will be no fat cats and bundlers giving money to the committee we want to provide an opportunity for small donors to finance the opposition to obama our maximum donation is 100
5615821 i pray to god we raise enough money to get the message out electing barack obama would be the end of the united states as we know and love it contribute now or pay later
5615822 i have not heard of any serious cases that have not been dealt with appropriately
5615823 but then in transport something changed understandably with the accident whether or not he went unconscious on them i dont know as time went by it became evident that he was injured more so than originally thought
5615824 we do not know what status he was in when the plane had its mishap whether he was in takeoff or landing
5615825 from what we can gather at this point hes an experienced pilot
5615826 but mr hussey loved flying he must have to go out alone
5615827 to be honest with you it didnt even occur to me at that point that we were on the road
5615828 its the last six weeks of the season and were kind of close to first place tampa bay is playing some unbelievable baseball so weve got to win games
5615829 thats a big part of my game going up the middle the other way
5615830 i just kind of got a little pull happy and so we talked today and tried to get back to staying out over the middle
5615831 i definitely wasnt trying to hit home runs that way but thats usually what happens youre not trying to youre just trying to keep it simple stay up the middle and all of a sudden boom you catch a couple
5615832 need to fight every once in a while for one at bat throughout a game one or two so maybe it will start coming together
5615833 hes standing out there like hes 6 foot 4 lefthanded strong kid
5615834 im sure if you ask him the game slowed down for him
5615835 hes accumulated some innings hes got some experience he executes pitches he gets it and throws it a little quicker than he used to hes got that cutter hes got some two seam movement with some velocity behind it hes got a lot of ways to get you out
5615836 mbs are no longer finding solace in standalone antivirus solutions they want capabilities such as anti spam firewall and intrusion detection
5615837 this is the time of the year when you have to be at your best
5615838 i know to this point its been a long season and you probably dont feel great but this is what you play for
5615839 this is the time of the year when you go out there and be your best im conscious of that from the day the season starts i dont want to run out of gas
5615840 i wouldnt be surprised if they finished where they are now
5615841 tampa bay is playing unbelievable baseball nobody expected tampa bay to be there but ive been saying since the start of the year they have the players
5615842 it almost seems that jon lester has become more of an ace than beckett it really doesnt matter who it is but lester is a lefty who when he takes the mound you feel you youre going to win the game and hes going to go deep for you
5615843 i never intended to invite him to play for iran

5615845 dejagah considers himself a german and is currently playing for german teams
5615846 in the wake of this incident the ontario government has committed to a full review of its regulations since essentially the same regulations are in place in nova scotia i urge the minister to conduct a full review of the regulations in nova scotia to ensure that an incident like the one that occurred in toronto will not happen in nova scotia
5615847 from the day of my installation meeting people in their own communities has been a priority for me
5615848 hosting a garden party outside of the halifax region seemed like the next step in making the office of the lieutenant governor accessible to as many nova scotians as possible
5615849 the smell was so strong that i thought somebody must have been smoking in the car
5615850 at first i thought it could have still been the previous passengers although that would have been illegal too
5615851 i didnt really look at the roof number because i was kind of shocked
5615852 you have a responsibility to report it thats why i ended up calling the police about this
5615853 i was home safe so it wasnt about me it was just about other people getting in with him
5615854 i was told theyre self employed theres nothing we can do
5615855 i leave a message in the evening but in the morning the drivers going to be sober and off the road
5615856 a woman said they couldnt do anything if i didnt have the roof number or the licence plate which i was really upset at myself about i felt kind of guilty for not knowing it
5615857 as soon as i mentioned the smell and all that stuff he got really really defensive and started almost yelling at me and saying that it was probably the passengers that were high as a kite
5615858 unfortunately i will say our dispatcher handled this the wrong way in our opinion at this stage
5615859 i call the driver in check the driver out check the car out
5615860 if i thought the driver was indeed high on drugs he would no longer be employed here
5615861 i would have perceived it as an impaired driving complaint
5615862 there would actually be nothing we could do about it at this point because it was two days ago
5615863 to charge someone with impaired driving you need to have them within two hours
5615864 we stopped in the middle of the northumberland strait because to put it bluntly nature was calling
5615865 when i went to take the wheel again i heard what sounded like kids playing on the beach yelling and screaming
5615866 we heard people loud and clear that they didnt like that price last year
5615867 weve been getting a lot of good feedback to the idea
5615868 we want to make sure the exhibition is affordable to families because its all about family entertainment were hoping with the week pass people will be able to come and go more than once

5615877 he had a brutal upbringing being beaten heavily by his father and harassed by the police for innocent games he became repeatedly arrested for the same offence on every occasion as far as he was concerned trumped up charges by policemen who didnt like him he joined the royal navy where he was birched and ended up in his twenties as a chimney sweep
5615878 what this report says to me is people are becoming educated
5615879 in the past its always been that if you got a mental illness you were basically doomed to an asylum
5615880 but thats no longer the case people are starting to recognize that
5615881 this years report card shines a harsh and frankly unflattering light on the attitudes we canadians have concerning mental health
5615882 in some ways mental illness is the final frontier of socially acceptable discrimination
5615883 can you imagine the public uproar if mental health was replaced with race gender or religion
5615884 these figures show clearly the insidious stigma still associated with mental health and mental illness
5615885 these are the attitudes that have kept mental health on the outside for far too long
5615886 i want to make a difference and put a smile on the kids faces

5615909 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5615910 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5615911 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5615912 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

5615920 deep testing ground would be far from ideal for him the plan is still to run him but there is now a slight doubt well discuss the situation with the owners and make a decision after that
5615921 im a great believer in my horse hes tough and hes genuine a good horse can go on any ground its a clash of the titans and its a very hot race but although i respect them all i fear nothing
5615922 terus terang habis ngomongin soal kerjaan lain atau apa pun saya terus duduk selama dua jam dengan asisten desainer saya kita bikin sepuluh desain kemudian saya mengontrol desain yang ingin saya ciptakan selalu ada proses kreatif
5615923 saya selalu melakukan show reguler bersama appmi asosiasi perancang dan pengusaha mode indonesia minimum dua kali setahun juga fashion show yang relatif lebih kecil barangkali kurang publikasi saja

5615928 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5615929 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5615930 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5615931 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5615932 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5615933 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5615934 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5615935 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5615936 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5615937 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5615938 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5615939 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5615940 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5615941 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5615942 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5615943 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5615944 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5615945 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5615946 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5615947 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5615948 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5615949 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5615950 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5615951 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5615952 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5615953 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5615954 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5615955 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5615956 the whole years before that i thought it was normal

5615965 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5615966 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5615967 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5615968 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5615969 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5615970 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5615971 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5615972 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5615973 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5615974 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5615975 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5615976 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5615977 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5615978 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5615979 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5615980 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5615981 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5615982 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5615983 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5615984 it was really really cool just to win for him in the end
5615985 sam swung over the top of that pitch to get dylan safely into second base the hit is gravy to me
5615986 we anticipated him being such a huge element on this team that we had him rostered even though he was a dead spot on our roster
5615987 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5615988 most anybody when they leave their country their first choice would be to go back home if they could
5615989 if you look at these groups coming here theyre among the most unlikely to go back and those having the most trouble
5615990 because we have the arabic speaking community and new jersey has a lot of diversity we do get them here
5615991 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5615992 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5615993 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5615994 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5615995 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5615996 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5615997 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5615998 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5615999 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5616000 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5616001 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

5616021 we have to protect these players and this is a fruitful way to avoid players like cesc fabregas moving for nothing to england
5616022 we at bayern had the best player at the last under 17 world championship toni kroos and there were 20 odd scouts from england sitting there it is not good and something must be done
5616023 they young players are not merely businesses concrete proposals must be developed to prevent the trafficking or exploitation of young players otherwise the risk is that more and more young players move abroad too early in their life
5616024 i think in football theres too much modern slavery in transferring players or buying players here and there and putting them somewhere

5616036 net energy for swine becomes more important as corn becomes more expensive
5616037 increasing energy from soybeans may provide added nutritional value so the soybean checkoff is funding research to look at this issue

5616039 especially during this time of rising feed costs net energy is a new look at how feeds can be formulated to meet the needs of pigs as well as a way to possibly save producers money this research is going to help us be much smarter with our feed

5616087 its a lot different when youre playing for your country
5616088 there were a lot of bigger players down there stronger girls
5616089 i just hope that well be able to lead our team into the medal round and bring home a medal
5616090 thats definitely my goal i think we have a lot of quick athletes a lot of heart on this team a lot of girls who really want it
5616091 we had a bit of time without them this summer and its given some of our other players time to grow
5616092 its really raised the level of our play weve come a long way this summer and having those two back has certainly helped
5616093 were not very big which is typical of nova scotian teams but our guard play is our strength

5616104 the leafs owe me 2 million i aint leaving till i get it
5616105 this is the strongest staff we have ever gone out to nationals with no question
5616106 we have the possibility of a guy like craig langille not even throwing in the round robin thats a good luxury to have
5616107 we had to get bailey some innings in truro on saturday because it was about a month since the last time he threw we had a huge gap between games so we needed to get the rust out but well be ready come thursday
5616108 we like to go with veterans and most of the pickups have been there before
5616109 its a different experience completely different from the regular season
5616110 obviously i would have liked to do better but it was only the preliminaries i have a chance to start from scratch in the semis im going to rest up and come back strong tomorrow tuesday
5616111 by way of comparison aug 8 to 18 last year the cbc ca sports website did 1 2 million page views in total
5616112 this was the first chance to put my best effort forward just to see what i could do
5616113 the race was all right definitely not good by my standards
5616114 but at the same time its a good kick in the behind for me
5616115 the first race of the regatta youre just sort of getting used to your surroundings
5616116 you just have to have races under your belt ive got lots of those
5616117 i just started this sport for fun and it wasnt an olympic sport
5616118 then it got into the olympics i went to three games and i have a third medal im still trying to soak it in i think
5616119 i remember back in the early 70s when i had a disastrous grand prix my wife lynn said to me dont worry youre going to be a late bloomer
5616120 and so the olympics dont go well and id say lynn said im a late bloomer ill go to the next one and sure enough guess what happened i bloomed
5616121 not making it out of the heats thats just ridiculous
5616122 i couldnt really get out of my bed until two days ago
5616123 it was just a lack of energy my body was just completely fatigued it hurt to touch it hurt to lay down it hurt to do everything i thought i was over it but it seems like it still has taken a lot out of my body
5616124 my coach joel filliol was there and i said i wanted to continue he asked me to try to move my elbow i tried once more and couldnt so i knew i was done
5616125 there is nothing worse than not finishing i wouldnt have cared if i finished last with a broken arm but i needed another arm to climb those hills today
5616126 obviously i would have liked to do better but it was only the preliminaries i have a chance to start from scratch in the semis im going to rest up and come back strong tomorrow tuesday
5616127 all we can do now is go back and see how it all plays out
5616128 well come out tomorrow and compete and play the way team canada is supposed to play
5616129 we didnt stick with the plan today which was to control the ball
5616130 it was really fast right from the start i am happy with my strategy
5616131 this is a new routine for us and it was really important to do well on day 1
5616132 its important for young guys to know they can come up big in those situations
5616133 hes been working with our hitting coach don long and is getting better
5616134 he worked to get a good pitch to hit im sure it was a nice boost to get that
5616135 if we hang around long enough we have the ability to get it done
5616136 we took advantage of a couple of mistakes to push across some runs
5616137 it was just a lot of pitches a lot of pitches
5616138 weve got to find a better way of economizing those pitches at some point
5616139 its not getting any worse but its not getting any better
5616140 its a little sore but i just think i have to keep doing my stuff between starts
5616141 its going to get better its not getting any worse
5616142 we had some opportunities but you have got to give their left handed pitcher credit too
5616143 he really made the pitches he had to when we had men in scoring position hes probably their hottest pitcher right now it was a difficult battle
5616144 when im good to go ill be out there i dont think its going to get any worse any better
5616145 based on my own experience i do not believe that
5616146 the most vicious short squeeze woolworths takeover rejection highlights significant risk to shareholders from pensions
5616147 the massive form of twisting geometric shapes and colours attracts just about everyone who sees it it is visually interesting and it becomes the centrepiece for meeting and conversation but that is not at the expense of the function of bloqx because of this harmony between form and function bloqx has initially been one of the most popular products we have ever shown to architects
5616148 when you reach the top it is the place to see and be seen and meet new friends
5616149 kompan was founded thirty five years ago by an artist who was inspired by children playing on his oversized colorful sculptures in a park bloqx is a perfect example that this approach is still very much at the heart of all of kompan products

5616172 anything you can do to help in terms of increasing sales retaining customers adding new customers is really going to help

5616254 i think its excellent news for quebec and for canada everyone is very excited
5616255 its going to be enormous not just for training but for the political connections as well
5616256 it will help the credibility of canada when the canadian boxers are better known to international judges and its going to get us better results
5616257 we now have taken a significant step in a project which will lift the standards across all areas of boxing
5616258 in the last couple of years canadian boxing has been a disaster
5616259 were going to see a huge improvement with the best coaches in the world coming here trupish didnt have access to all of that is going to be available at the academy
5616260 dat had ik nou nooit gedacht dat jij een vaste relatie zou krijgen
5616261 hoe moet dat straks als alle kinderen het huis uit zijn
5616262 it would be easy to give in and let inflation get out of control thats what happened in the 1970s but it would be damaging and dangerous to the economy
5616263 all being well inflation will fall again next year and will be much closer to the two per cent target by the end of 2009 but that will only happen if people dont chase inflationary wage increases
5616264 everyone wants to protect their living standard but if everyone does it prices will just go up again as businesses try to cover their higher costs then well all be back to square one but with inflation still high
5616265 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5616266 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5616267 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5616268 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5616269 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5616270 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5616271 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5616272 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5616273 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5616274 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5616275 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5616276 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5616277 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5616278 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5616279 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5616280 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5616281 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5616282 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5616283 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5616284 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5616285 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5616286 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5616287 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5616288 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5616289 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5616290 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5616291 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5616292 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5616293 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5616294 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5616295 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5616296 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5616297 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5616298 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5616299 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5616300 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5616301 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5616302 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5616303 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5616304 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5616305 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5616306 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5616307 which leads to an infinite regress and is therefore logically impossible
5616308 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5616309 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5616310 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5616311 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5616312 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5616313 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5616314 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5616315 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5616316 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5616317 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5616318 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5616319 this is a planning took where all things are going

5616324 the final communique from this crucial meeting lacks the vision to address the regions current energy and environmental crises and most importantly lack the sense of urgency to address climate change if this meeting is the yardstick to address the greatest environmental threat we are facing today our leaders have condemned us to dangerous climate change and a dirty expensive energy future
5616325 the business as usual scenario is not an option for future generations co2 emissions would almost triple by 2050 the energy ministers need to reverse all decisions taken at this meeting and revisit the need to implement legally binding target for renewable energies and introduce a renewable energy legislation to enable investments in renewable energy technologies asean member countries must provide strict and detailed regulations on how to implement renewable energy projects to minimize bureaucracy and avoid ambiguous interpretation for existing regulation

5616336 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5616337 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5616338 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5616339 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5616340 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5616341 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5616342 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5616343 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones

5616347 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5616348 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5616349 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5616350 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5616351 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5616352 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5616353 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5616354 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5616355 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5616356 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5616357 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally

5616388 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

5616404 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5616405 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5616406 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5616407 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5616408 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5616409 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5616410 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5616411 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5616412 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5616413 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5616414 why dont we create a better life for ourselves and eliminate all the suffering and misery that we see in our world
5616415 all the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players
5616416 we are all spirit children of god with the same properties and abilities god has
5616417 the second concept is that when we choose to enter the physical world of the relative we make an agreement with god to relinquish the knowledge we have that our true self is one of a spirit child of god

5616419 oftentimes it is not the dream of the teeth falling out that creates the disturbance to the psyche but the feelings that accompany the dream there is often a feeling of helplessness of powerlessness the teeth are coming out and there is nothing the dreamer can do to stop the process whichever way they make their exit the dreamer is left with not only a gap in her smile but a hole in her heart when she awakens
5616420 dreams of tooth loss coupled with anxiety reflect a fear of change fear of transition ask yourself if there is some transition that you are fearful of making
5616421 sometimes tooth loss dreams point to a fear of failure or embarrassment in waking life when people lose teeth they often cover their mouths when talking or smiling is there something you want to do but are afraid of undertaking because you fear youll look foolish if you fail

5616463 senior al qaeda leader believed to have plotted and executed attacks against u s coalition forces including a februrary 2007 bombing at bagram air base in afghanistan during a visit by vice president dick cheney
5616464 increasing role in al qaeda propaganda suggests that he would have been a top field commander and planner for al qaeda his death if confirmed clearly will have an impact on the radical jihads movement
5616465 tuesday the new york times reported that a senior intelligence official said there is new evidence al qaeda operatives in pakistan are training westerners most likely including u s citizens

5616490 i dont think it was that ragey but its all a matter of perspective i guess
5616491 guys dont always feel chipper in the first part of the week when they get dinged up but they find a way to push to saturday
5616492 thats how hes approaching the thing and thats how were approaching the thing to play in saturdays game
5616493 im sure its his wish to get as many turns as he can
5616494 sometimes they just flat dont know what to do do i shut down and sit down do i show up and treat how do you do that
5616495 they have never been part of a training room culture nor do they want to be
5616496 injuries happen its a part of football hell work hard to get back out and hell know when hes ready
5616497 i think he understands the fact that he needs to get out there for 16 games this year
5616498 maybe we learn to live to fight another day and take 2 less yards up the field
5616499 i think ive just continued to get better in the preseason in the games and in practice so this will be another step to take
5616500 to come to a decision like that weve taken a lot of things into consideration last year how orton finished the season training camp preseason games
5616501 in the end it comes down to a gut feeling that you have
5616502 completions turnovers to just the feeling we have on who can manage the game the best for us all of things like that
5616503 and the good thing about evaluating both rex and kyle weve had a long time to do it its been quite a few years weve had a chance to see both guys play
5616504 people make such a big deal about that my rookie year and everything but i think everybody on this team has gotten better since they were a rookie and not just me
5616505 that stuffs in the past and im just focused on playing good football now
5616506 my accuracy has improved my command of the offense has improved and just being able to play at a high level
5616507 both guys were in the same situation which is a good part about it
5616508 both guys played both preseason games with the same line i think we did about what we could to let them compete fairly for the position
5616509 i wasnt even sure what the contract situation was to be honest
5616510 no competitor will agree with a decision when it doesnt go their way
5616511 rex is a team player hes been in this situation before and hell do whatever he needs to do to help our football team win
5616512 we dont name any guys starters for lifetime or anything like that but we feel real good about kyle just like we feel good about olin kreutz being our center and lance briggs being our linebacker
5616513 it is kind of frustrating wondering who the starting quarterback is
5616514 thats probably one of the most important players on the team is the quarterback now that weve got it all resolved and we know who the starter is then now we can get down to business
5616515 were we perfect absolutely not weve had missteps and those are the lessons learned it was over the last few years that we were able to incorporate all of the lessons learned that we have throughout this investigation
5616516 unfortunately a lot of them are not going to be able to be answered in the immediate future
5616517 his only response was that he wanted to hang out there which was not a very compelling reason
5616518 theres always going to be a spore on the grassy knoll
5616519 that alternative treatments are touted as though they offer marvelous benefits
5616520 uninterested in determining the safety and efficacy of their interventions
5616521 chiropractors who manipulate the neck can cause a stroke some herbs can cause adverse reactions or can interfere with conventional drugs
5616522 homeopathic remedies which of course contain no active ingredient can be dangerous if they delay or replace a more orthodox treatment
5616523 the worst therapy encountered so far it is an implausible therapy that has failed to prove itself after two centuries and some 200 clinical studies
5616524 scarlett died for the simple fact that she was in the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong people as well as being blitzed with drugs late at night in a foreign country

5616527 you failed in fact for the soil to be properly dealt with at any time would you agree and i put it to you that you did that to increase the benefit to you and mr sanhueza
5616528 it turned out that way but it wasnt the initial idea
5616529 there was a deadline from the brigade to get the da through
5616530 it wasnt a monetary decision at first the da expired by a certain date and we had to get it passed
5616531 i suggest to you that you and mr sanhueza said to him mr guirguis that if he didnt buy the goods you would not give him any more work

5616558 that would be a separate league that would be nba affiliated or nba sponsored but it would be independent

5616629 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure

5616653 newly unredacted report confirms psychologists supported illegal interrogations in iraq and afghanistan
5616654 in september or october of 2002 fbi agents observed that a canine was used in an aggressive manner to intimidate detainee after he had been subjected to intense isolation for over three months during that time period was totally isolated with the exception of occasional interrogations in a cell that was always flooded with light by late november the detainee was evidencing behavior consistent with extreme psychological trauma talking to non existent people reporting hearing voices crouching in the corner of a cell covered with a sheet for hours on end it is unknown to the fbi whether such extended isolation was approved by dod authorities
5616655 enlisted medics witnessed obvious episodes of detainee abuse apparently without reporting them to superiors

5616688 we tried to have these debates in private in the first weeks after sol trujillo came to canberra
5616689 that was the day that phil burgess decided to say he wouldnt recommend telstra shares to his mother
5616690 it was workshopped in advance it was designed to give telstra some traction in the telecommunications debate the remark did earn phil some critics and did in some peoples minds brand him as a buffoon but ultimately the comment achieved its desired effect he catapulted regulation from the business pages into the general news pages and attracted an audience that it wouldnt have attracted otherwise
5616691 weve broken the habit of governments that treated telstra as community property
5616692 telstras strategy is the same as it has been for the last three years phil burgess changed telstra forever and the company will now always be one that advocates the needs of its customers and stakeholders
5616693 what we do is borrow resources from the existing corporate affairs team resources are allocated sometimes a little like the old days and we get by on a smell of an oily rag weve got some good contractors who do the work but not nearly as many as you would think it should have we fund it to some extent but not nearly to the extent i think we should thatll happen in a few years time

5616703 the last two weeks i started to get the hang of it
5616704 we didnt want to make a political manifesto we wanted to make good entertainment

5616717 es war schwierig wir wussten dass uns die strecke nicht besonders liegen w rde aber wir hatten mehr zu k mpfen als unsere direkten gegner wir haben jetzt in drei aufeinanderfolgenden rennen keine punkte geholt was uns sehr schmerzt nach dem frankreich grand prix lagen wir in der konstrukteurswertung auf platz vier heute sind wir sechste uns ist bewusst wie eng es zugeht und dass sich die kr fteverh ltnisse sehr schnell verschieben k nnen
5616718 als n chstes steht valencia auf dem programm eine f r alle neue strecke wie bereitet sich das red bull team auf diese aufgabe vor

5616720 weil die strecke durch das neu bebaute hafengebiet einige langsame kurven aufweist wird es in valencia sehr stark auf die kraft im unteren drehzahlbereich ankommen es sieht so aus als w rde der kurs die motoren nicht ungew hnlich stark fordern das ist f r uns eine gute nachricht denn wir treten in spanien mit denselben triebwerken an die wir schon in ungarn benutzt haben

5616749 in zijn antwoord op mijn vraag van 19 december 2007 leek de minister optimistisch inzake het verder verloop van het dossier inzake de teruggave aan de vlaamse gemeenschap van het meubilair uit het koninklijk paleis op de meir in antwerpen de minister had het over informele contacten met het kabinet van zijn federale collega reynders die perspectief leken te geven op een oplossing voor deze kwestie juridisch stond het voor de minister overigens vast dat de overdracht van het gebouw en van de meubelen van de belgische staat aan de vlaamse gemeenschap geformaliseerd was in een koninklijk besluit in het verlengde van een bijzondere wet hij wees er op dat de conventie van granada duidelijk zegt dat in gevallen als deze de roerende goederen mee beschermd worden de minister beloofde in deze kwestie de druk hoog te houden met het oog op de opening in 2009 thans zou blijken dat prins filip de meubelen met de steun van de federale regering zou behouden minister reynders zou inderdaad betwisten dat de meubelen aan de vlaamse gemeenschap toebehoren vermits in 1970 het paleis en dus ook het meubilair door de civiele lijst aan de belgische regering werd overgedragen hij negeert natuurlijk de overdracht die in 1996 bij koninklijk besluit werd voltrokken evenals de genoemde conventie van granada er is in dit dossier duidelijk sprake van manifeste onwil om niet te zeggen tegenwerking van het koningshuis en in diens verlengde van de federale regering hoe reageert de minister hierop heeft hij al verdere initiatieven genomen de minister zegde eind 2007 dat idealiter een naadloze aansluiting met een gerestaureerd paleis zou zijn dat de meubelen er in optimale omstandigheden zou kunnen ontvangen worden kan dat scenario nog worden aangehouden in het licht van de opening in de loop van 2009

5616751 they have however built a magnificent platform in beijing for success in 2012 the sight of britain above australia in the medal table has caused some angst down under
5616752 the last time i played at centre half was man city away last season
5616753 i dont mind playing left back but i prefer being in the centre so it was good to be back in there
5616754 i t s b e e n well publ i c i s e d that the manager is looking for a new centreback left back and centre forward
5616755 you certainly dont want players who will be happy to just sit on the bench you want people who can come in and challenge its all about working hard and trying to keep the shirt
5616756 it will hopefully work in our favour that weve got one or two tottenham old boys in our team now and im sure theyll be desperate to put one over on their old club
5616757 well go down there taking heart from what we did especially in the first 30 minutes against liverpool that first 45 minutes was some of the best football theyve seen from a sunderland side up here for a long time
5616758 i dont think well be able to get billy permanently im not totally sure what ipswichs thoughts on him are
5616759 he likes playing games regularly but hes disappointed he didnt score on saturday with that effort he had
5616760 hopefully he will continue enjoying it and ipswich will be happy for him to stay for a longer period wed love to keep him longer than a month
5616761 he went on loan to falkirk last season but didnt really enjoy it it was a six month loan and they cant be cancelled once youve started so we said come here for a month see if you enjoy it
5616762 the bookings all count at the end of the season but he was frustrated because he thought he was going to have a chance at goal and thought their defender handled the ball hes got to learn to curb that
5616763 i have said to taylor watch and learn from this guy and he will help you
5616764 if he does he will make the step up from u21s to where coloccini is at full international level he wants to learn that is the key some young players dont but he does
5616765 newcastle have tried to get a few defenders here but for one reason or another it has not worked but i think for the next five years that could be our central partnership coloccini has signed for five years and so has steven so everything is there
5616766 he has only trained with the players once but when you have played for argentina 29 times something like coming here wont faze you
5616767 he has played in brazil in front of bigger crowds just this summer i had no option because i lost cacapa on friday but i did not have any worries about it
5616768 i just told him to go out there and enjoy it and i think he did he said afterwards it was very quick and that he can normally get more passes through but i told him that was the premier league it is a little bit different what he needs to learn he will learn very quickly
5616769 when we saw him train with the lads on saturday we looked at him and i thought wow he will just love going to old trafford he came to me and said i want to play and that was it

5616808 from this winter that is from october end passengers travelling from delhi to helsinki and at least 12 other destinations in europe will get the advantage of morning flights
5616809 in the process we are temporarily having to reduce the frequency of our daily flights to new delhi by a day and to mumbai where we now operate six days a week to four days
5616810 we will also continue to be the fastest to ferry passengers to as many as 16 out of 38 destinations in europe what we will be unable to serve as we have been doing now is the mumbai new york sector because of the rescheduling

5616814 die politik soll und darf nicht von der beschimpfung anderer bestimmt sein wir lassen uns nicht auf solche spielchen ein denn unsere gesellschaftlichen werte und politischen ideen m ssen im vordergrund stehen
5616815 ich wei genau dass ich auf euch alle in den n chsten wochen z hlen kann wir haben nicht viel zeit aber umso mehr mut
5616816 nur wenn die politik die richtigen rahmenbedingungen f r wirtschaftsbetriebe stellt kann eine firma am gro en europ ischen markt erfolgreich sein investitionen in die forschung tragen immer zur sicherung des standortes bei und sind somit f r sichere arbeitspl tze unerl sslich

5616819 die entwicklung bei den bestandskunden war u erst positiv viele unternehmen die schon seit jahren erfolgreich mit oxaion arbeiten befinden sich auf expansionskurs sie haben zus tzliche module wie qualit tsmanagement oder business intelligence in ihren betrieben eingef hrt dar ber hinaus gibt es zahlreiche kunden die weitere werke und niederlassungen im ausland mit der erp software von oxaion ausgestattet haben
5616820 dass die leidige diskussion ber anzeigepflicht oder nicht immer noch gef hrt wird ja berhaupt gef hrt werden muss ist bedenklich
5616821 zum schutz von kindern ist eine anzeigepflicht unumg nglich es kann ja wohl nicht sein dass jemand von kindesmisshandlungen wei sein wissen aber zum nachteil des kindes ja zu dessen gef hrdung an seele leib und leben f r sich beh lt und daf r nicht belangt werden kann
5616822 dass sich strafbar macht wer verbrechen an kindern dadurch deckt indem er sie nicht zur anzeige bringt die politik hat zudem alle erforderlichen ressourcen f r umfassenden kinderschutz bereit zu stellen jugend mter sind in der pflicht m gliche defizite auch in den eigenen reihen schonungslos aufzudecken was nicht sein darf sind zust nde wie im fall luca wo es bis heute zwar unterschiedliche verdachtslagen aber keine klarstellungen zur rolle der mutter gibt der bruder des ermordeten luca aber unver ndert in einem haushalt mit ihr lebt
5616823 nicht nur dass der alten dame die unsicheren papier unseri s sch ngeredet wurden ist u erst bedenklich
5616824 der pensionistin wurde weil sie das geld zum kauf ja gar nicht hatte die aufnahme eines kredits eingeredet eine solche vorgangsweise widerspricht eklatant den empfehlungen der wirtschaftskammer zum damals geltenden wertpapieraufsichtsgesetz die diese zur sorgfaltspflicht bei der anlageberatung erarbeitet hat
5616825 es ist unglaublich dass nicht einmal in diesem fall das unternehmen trotz mehrmaliger schlichtungsversuche zum einlenken bereit war am ende blieb dem vki und mir also nur der rechtsweg wer solche falschen beratungen durchf hrt muss dann wohl auch die konsequenzen tragen
5616826 blitze schlagen meist in erh hte gegenst nde wie antennenmasten oder b ume ein doch auch menschen k nnen verletzt werden wenn sie die gefahr von blitzschlag untersch tzen
5616827 schwimmen kann bei gewitter lebensbedrohlich sein denn wasser zieht blitze an bei aufsteigendem unwetter deshalb sofort aus dem wasser kommen

5616830 wir sind als naturfreunde organisation bereits an die parlamentsklubs herangetreten weil wir f r eine einheitliche gesetzliche regelung in ganz sterreich eintreten ma volles schwammerl suchen bis zu 2 kilo soll f r jede waldbesucherin und jeden waldbesucher kostenlos erlaubt sein hingegen soll kommerzielles abgrasen der schwammerlbest nde im gro en stil durch entsprechende strafen und kontrollen verhindert werden
5616831 wir naturfreunde lehnen eintrittsgelder in die natur grunds tzlich ab weil die freie natur f r alle menschen da sein muss schwammerllizenzen sind nichts anderes als gesch ftemacherei ohne positive auswirkungen auf das kologische gleichgewicht denn am meisten unter den teuren lizenzen w rden jene leiden die am wenigsten sammeln wer hingegen dem kommerziellen schwammerl tourismus das handwerk legen will der muss gemeinsam mit dem gesetzgeber eine l sung suchen und nicht wahllos die naturbesucher abkassieren der von den naturfreunden eingeschlagene weg auf den bundesgesetzgeber zu zugehen kann hierbei als vorbild dienen
5616832 die bundeszusch sse zur wohnbauf rderung sind seit 1996 auf dem niveau von 1 78 mrd euro eingefroren nicht einmal die inflation wurde ausgeglichen das kommt einer stillen k rzung der wohnbauf rderungsmittel gleich es m ssen nun endlich ausreichende mittel f r die wohnbauf rderung zur verf gung gestellt werden die sowohl den ausreichenden neubau von leistbaren wohnungen als auch einen fokus auf den klimaschutz gew hrleisten wohnbauf rderungsmittel d rfen au erdem nicht mehr f r das stopfen diverser budgetl cher verwendet werden wie dies seit der abschaffung der zweckbindung f r wohnbauf rderungsmittel der fall ist
5616833 die wohnbauf rderung wurde in den vergangenen jahren oft stiefm tterlich behandelt der damalige finanzminister karl heinz grasser wollte sie im zuge der finanzausgleichsverhandlungen im jahr 2004 sogar drastisch k rzen dabei haben wir mit der wohnbauf rderung ein instrument in der hand das mit ausreichenden mitteln versehen nicht nur wesentlich zum erreichen der klimaschutzziele beitragen kann sondern zus tzlich auch leistbares wohnen und tausende arbeitspl tze sichert
5616834 der bau ist einer der stabilsten sektoren der sterreichischen wirtschaft wir brauchen eine sanierungsoffensive auch zur sicherung qualitativ hochwertiger arbeitspl tze eine sanierungsoffensive bei eigenheimen bedeutet nicht nur einen massiven beitrag zum klimaschutz sondern schafft au erdem arbeitspl tze gerade auch im l ndlichen raum in konkreten zahlen 100 millionen euro an wohnbauinvestitionen schaffen und sichern rund 2 000 arbeitspl tze j hrlich investitionen in die w rmed mmung bringen noch mehr sie sichern n mlich bis zu 3 000 arbeitspl tze
5616835 vor allem im mietwohnungsbestand der gemeinn tzigen bautr ger aber auch bei eigenheimen konnten durch das umstellen von heizsystemen und durch sanierungsma nahmen bereits erfolge bei der co2 reduktion erzielt werden hier sind wir also auf einem richtigen weg der freilich zus tzlicher f rderungen bedarf im b ro und dienstleistungsgeb udebereich haben die co2 emissionen hingegen zugenommen hier muss es ma geschneiderte sanierungsstrategien geben
5616836 denn die gute wohnversorgung in sterreich ist vor allem auf kontinuit t im neubau zur ckzuf hren
5616837 wir brauchen raschest m glich finanzierungszusagen die sich auch im budget wiederfinden die politisch verantwortlichen haben dieses thema bereits viel zu lange vernachl ssigt tatsache ist dass 0 5 prozent von jedem lohn und gehalt insgesamt rund 700 millionen euro von den arbeitnehmerinnen j hrlich als wohnbauf rderungsbeitrag geleistet werden die menschen haben ein recht darauf sich verlassen zu k nnen dass jenes geld das ihnen f r die wohnbauf rderung genommen wird von den politisch verantwortlichen in bund und l ndern auch tats chlich f r seinen verwendungszweck eingesetzt wird derzeit ist dies nicht der fall die forderungen der bau sozialpartner m ssen daher dringend umgesetzt werden es muss wieder eine zweckbindung der wohnbauf rderung und zus tzliche finanzmittel in der h he von mindestens 1 mrd euro geben derzeit werden ffentliche mittel f r dringend notwendige heizkostenzusch sse an einkommensschwache familien ausbezahlt die in wohnungen mit desolaten fenstern und schlechter w rmeisolierung leben m ssen der langfristig richtige weg w re es massiv in die geb udesanierung und in den so dringend ben tigten klimagerechten wohnungsneubau zu investieren und somit heizkostenzusch sse immer weniger notwendig zu machen und den menschen gleichzeitig lebenswerten wohnraum zu erm glichen

5616848 mandals are casual footwear thats what its meant to be
5616849 the more seriously one takes the mandal the more ridiculous one looks
5616850 unless you work at op or quicksilver mandals are not appropriate for the office
5616851 if anyone were to find me in a business suit and flip flops in midtown i hope that they would hit me with a taxi because someone has taken over my brain
5616852 the most stylish guys will just wear a rolled up skinny jean with a thong sandal that classic summery cape cod look is so big again right now
5616853 it should be simple easy and summery the mandal should not be a fashion statement

5616860 according to the world health organization depression is one of the leading causes of disability with approximately 121 million people suffering with depression worldwide the national institute of mental health states that approximately 18 million people suffer from depression in america alone depression does not discriminate across age race gender or class among teenagers it is estimated that 20 percent will suffer from depression at some point by the time they reach adulthood there are also as many as 8 3 percent of teens suffering from depression for at least a year at a time compared to 5 3 percent of the general population between 20 and 50 of depressed kids and teens have a family history of depression and children of depressed parents are more than three times as likely to suffer from depression u s surgeon general s survey 1999 depression often co occurs with anxiety disorders and substance abuse with 30 percent of teens with depression also developing a substance abuse problem nimh 2 3 of those suffering from depression never seek treatment untreated depression is the number one cause of suicide and suicide is the third leading cause of death among teenagers nimh while not always the case often untreated depression and other struggles lead to unhealthy ways in which we try and deal with the hurt and pain we are feeling we try and find anything that we can do to take away the hurt painful feelings or negative thoughts we are experiencing often the things that we turn to seem to help at first appearing to provide some of the relief that we need so badly but even though they may seem like they help often they are unhealthy themselves eventually becoming even greater struggles like addictions such as drugs alcohol eating disorders or self injury self injury remained very much a mystery until 1996 when princess diana revealed that she had struggled with it it has become much more visible in society within the last ten years self injury is also termed self mutilation self harm or self abuse it can be defined as the deliberate repetitive impulsive non lethal harming of ones self including but not limited to 1 cutting 2 burning 3 picking or interfering with wound healing 4 infecting oneself 5 punching hitting self or objects 6 inserting objects in to skin 7 bruising or breaking bones and 8 some forms of hair pulling while these behaviors pose serious risks they may be symptoms of a problem that can be treated experts estimate that 4 of the population struggle with self injury it has the same occurrence between males and females even though in popular culture it can appear to be more prevalent among girls those who struggle with self injury may have many different reasons for their behavior some of which may be feelings of emptiness inability to understand or express what they are feeling loneliness fear past abuse depression as well as many others as self injury like many addictions is often a coping mechanism to deal with some manner of internal pain many who struggle with it also struggle with other issues such as eating disorders and alcohol and drug abuse while self injury may be someones way to cope with or relieve painful or hard to express feelings and is generally not a suicide attempt relief is always temporary and usually only perpetuates a destructive cycle that continues the struggle this cycle often means that those who do not get help can become more depressed and shameful adding to the pain and need for relief thus perpetuating the cycle dangers while self injury may not be about attempting suicide the damage done while harming oneself always carries the risks of inflicting serious and even lethal harm to oneself regardless of whether suicide is intended or not also the continued cycle of addiction and self harm as in substance abuse and other eating disorders can have a destructive effect on ones health both physically and mentally and struggles worsen as time continues without treatment self injury facts from safe alternatives online self injury like alcohol and drug abuse and eating disorders is addictive and thus not something that is easy to simply stop help and treatment are available though at times may be hard to find however while all addictions are very difficult to overcome help and treatment are out there and available and recovery and freedom are possible we believe this is true whether someones struggles may be self injury depression drugs and alcohol body image issues sexual addiction or other areas of brokenness

5616876 as any politician lech kaczynski has the right to have his own opinion he may be an anti communist and a russophobe but he was elected president to care about the interests of his country not the interests of georgia its security or saakashvili it is not his task to defend the u s position in this region to say nothing of his own unrealistic projects
5616877 absolutely understands the russian reaction because it was the georgians who attacked russian peacekeepers not the other way round

5616879 dan jika kamu bertanya mereka siapakah yang menciptakan segala langit dan bumi serta menjadikan matahari dan bulan nescaya mereka berkata allah
5616880 dan jika kamu bertanya mereka siapakah yang menurunkan hujan dari langit lalu dengannya dihidupkan bumi yang gersang nescaya mereka berkata allah
5616881 kalau kamu bertanya mereka siapakah menciptakan mereka nescaya mereka menjawab allah maka bagaimanakah mereka dapat dipalingkan daripada menyembah allah yang sebenar kepada menyembah yang lain dan allah mengetahui ucapan muhammad s a w ya tuhanku sesungguhnya mereka itu adalah kaum yang tidak beriman maka berpalinglah hai muhammad daripada mereka dan katakanlah salam selamat tinggal semuanya kelak mereka akan mengetahui nasib mereka yang buruk
5616882 dan ada di antara manusia orang jahiliah yang berkata kami beriman dengan allah dan dengan hari akhirat tetapi sebenarnya mereka tidak beriman mereka hanya menipu allah dan orang orang yang beriman dengannya sedang sebenarnya mereka tidak menipu melainkan diri mereka sendiri cuma mereka tidak sedar dalam hati mereka ada penyakit hati lalu allah menambahkan lagi sakit itu dan bagi mereka azab yang bersangatan pedih sebagai balasan kepada apa yang mereka dustakan
5616883 sesungguhnya kami turunkan kepada engkau hai muhammad kitab al quran dengan membawa kebenaran maka sembahlah allah dengan seikhlas ikhlas hati kerana agamanya ingatlah hanya kepunyaan allah agama yang bersih dan murni
5616884 dan mereka mereka yang mengambil pelindung menyembah selain daripada allah mereka beralasan kami tidak menyembah mereka melainkan supaya mereka mendekatkan kami kepada allah dengan sedekat dekatnya
5616885 sesungguhnya allah akan menghukum memutuskan di antara mereka tentang apa yang mereka berselisih padanya sesungguhnya allah tidak memberi hidayat kepada orang yang amat pendusta lagi amat kufur
5616886 apakah hukm undang undang jahiliah yang mereka kehendakkan dan hukum siapakah yang lebih baik daripada hukum allah bagi orang orang yang yakin
5616887 dan apabila dikatakan kepada mereka marilah kamu semua mengikut kepada apa yang diturunkan oleh allah dan kepada rasul lalu mereka itu berkata cukup memadailah bagi kami apa yang kami dapati daripada bapa bapa kami meskipun bapa bapa mereka itu tiada pengetahuan suatu apa pun dan tidak pula mendapat petunjuk
5616888 dijadikan kepada mereka yang kafir kesombongan di hati mereka yang dikenali dengan kosombongan jahiliah
5616889 dan mereka orang orang jahiliah berkata mengapa rasul itu memakan makanan dna berjalan jalan di pasar pasar mengapa tidak diturunkan kepadanya seorang malaikat yang boleh membantu memberi peringatan kepada kamu atau dicampakkan sahaja keapdanya harta berharga dari langit atau dia mempunyai sebidang dusun kebun yang dapat dimakan hasilnya berkata lagi orang orang zalim kafir itu tiadalah yang kamu ikut itu melainkan seorang lelaki yang kena sihir
5616890 dan jika kamu ragu ragu tentang aurat yang kami turunkan ke atas hamba kami muhammad maka perbuatkanlah olehmu satu surah seumpamanya dan jemputlah saksi saksi kamu selain daripada allah jika kamu orang yang benar jikalau tidak kamu lakukan dan tak akan dapat kamu lakukan yang demikian itu maka takutlah kepada api neraka yang bahan bakarnya ialah manusia dan batu batu yang disediakan untuk orang orang kafir
5616891 telah hampir kedatangan hari kiamat dan telah terbelah dua bulan jika mereka orang orang jahiliah melihat suatu petanda yang jelas tentang kenabian muhammad s a w mereka berpaling daripadanya dan berkata semuanya itu adalah perbuatan sihir yang berterusan mereka mendustakan dan mengikut hawa nafsu mereka sedang pada tiap tiap hal yang berlaku telah ada ketetapannya
5616892 dan ingatlah ketika orang orang kafir quraish memikirkan tipu daya mereka terhadapmu untuk menangkap dan memenjarakan kamu atau membunuhmu atau mengusir kamu keluar dari makkah mereka memikirkan tipu daya yang kotor dan allah menggagalkan tipu daya itu dan allahlah sebaik baik pembalas kepada tipu daya mereka
5616893 maka datanglah sesudah mereka yang dahulu generasi baru yang jahat dan ingkar yang mewarisi al kitab mereka tidak mempedulikan al kitab tetapi lebih mementingkan harta benda dunia yang rendah mutunya lalu mereka berkata allah akan memberi ampun kepada kami
5616894 maka datanglah sesudah mereka angkatan baru yang meninggalkan solat dan menurut hawa nafsu maka kelak akan tersesat dari jalan yang benar kecuali orang orang yang bertaubat beriman dan beramal soleh maka mereka itulah yang akan masuk syurga dan tidak teraniaya sedikit pun
5616895 dan sesungguhnya kami telah mengutuskan rasul pada tiap tiap umat untuk menyeru mereka agar menyembah menyerah diri kepada allah sahaja dan hendaklah menjauhkan diri pada daripada taghut
5616896 jikalau sekiranya penduduk negeri negeri di dunia beriman dan bertaqwa kepada allah pastilah kami allah akan melimpahkan barakah rezeki dan sebagainya dari langit dan bumi tetapi mereka mendustakan kufur dengan ayat ayat kami maka kami seksa mereka disebabkan perbuatan mereka sendiri
5616897 dan allah telah memberikan suatu contoh peringatan dengan sebuah negeri yang dahulunya amat aman lagi tenteram rezeki didapati datang padanya melimpah ruah dari segenap tempat tiba tiba penduduknya berubah mengkufuri nikmat allah dengan menderhaka kepadanya maka kerananya dibalas dengan memberikan pula mereka merasa kesusahan sehingga terjadi kelaparan dan ketakutan berpunca daripada perbuatan kekufuran yang mereka lakukan
5616898 sesungguhnya orang yang beriman dan beramal segala yang soleh mendirikan solat dan mengeluarkan zakat bagi mereka itu pahala dari sisi tuhan mereka dengannya mereka tidak akan berasa sebarang ketakutan dan mereka tidak pula berdukacita
5616899 bukanlah kefakiran yang aku takut berlaku ke atas kamu tetapi yang paling aku takut kekayaan dunia yang melimpah ruah ke atas kamu yang dengannya kamu berlumba mengejar harta itu hingga lupa kepada allah sepertimana umat umat lain sebelum kamu berlumba lumba mengejarnya sehingga mereka binasa sepertimana kamu juga akan binasa
5616900 bacalah kepada mereka berita tentang orang orang yang kami datangkan keapda mereka ayat ayat kami hukum hukum allah lalu mereka melepaskan diri membuang danmeninggalkannya daripada ayat ayat itu maka syaitan pun menunggangi mereka sehingga mereka menjadi orang yang sesat kalau kami kehendaki nescaya kami angkat darjat mereka dengan pelaksanaan hukum hukum daripada ayat ayat itu akan tetapi mereka menumpang di bumi seperti hendak kekal selama lamanya dan menurutkan hawa nafsunya maka bandingan mereka itu sama seperti seekor anjing yang terjulur lidahnya dihalau dihina ia menjulurkan lidahnya dibiarkan sahaja pun dijulur juga lidahnya yang demikian itu adalah bandingan kepada kaum bangsa yang mendustakan membelakangkan ayat ayat kami maka ceritakanlah kisah kisah itu moga moga mereka berfikir amat buruklah bandingan kamu bangsa yang mendustakan ayat ayat kami dan kepada kami mereka sendirilah mereka berbuat zalim
5616901 maka adapun orang orang yang beriman dan beramal soleh allah akan menyempurnakan pembalasan pahala baik mereka dan menambah untuk mereka sebahagian daripada kurnianya adapun orang yang enggan mengingkari perintah dan menyombong diri menolak kebenaran maka allah akan menyeksa mereka dengan seksaan yang pedih dan mereka tidak akan memperolehi bagi diri mereka pelindung pembela dan penolong pembantu selain daripada allah
5616902 dan peliharalah dirimu daripada melakukan fitnah kerana seksaan allah terhadap kesalahan itu tidak sahaja terkena kepada orang yang melakukan kezaliman itu secara khusus sahaja malah terkena kepada semua dan ketahuilah bahawa allah itu amat keras seksaannya
5616903 hendaklah kamu menyuruh melakukan makruf dan menegah mereka melakukan mungkar kalau tidak allah akan menurunkan azabnya ke atas manusia
5616904 dan kamu masyarakat jahiliah sedang berada di tepi tebing neraka kemusnahan maka kamu diselamatkan oleh islam daripadanya
5616905 wahai orang yang beriman masuklah ke dalam islam keseluruhan kesemuanya dan janganlah kamu turut langkah langkah syaitan sesungguhnya syaitan itu musuh kamu yang paling nyata
5616906 tidak ada daya dan kekuatan melainkan dengan izin allah yang maha tinggi lagi maha adil
5616907 dan sesiapa yang bergantung dengan allah maka sesungguhnya diberi petunjuk kepada jalan yang lurus
5616908 bahawa sesungguhnya orang yang sebelum daripada kamu kerana mereka menjadi penganut islam sebenar mereka diseksa oleh musuh dengan menggunakan sikat besi sehingga tanggal daging daripada tulangnya namun mereka tidak berganjak dari agamanya akan tetapi kamu gopoh dengan tidak lebih banyak bersabar
5616909 wahai orang yang beriman sahutilah penuhilah seruan allah dan seruan rasul apabila diseru kamu kepada sesuatu yang akan memberi kehidupan yang lebih sempurna kepada kamu
5616910 dan sesungguhnya agama islam yang kami turunkan ini adalah jalanku yang lurus maka hendaklah kamu ikutinya dan jangan sekali kali kamu mengikut jalan jalan yang lain kelak jalan jalan itu akan memporak porandakan kamu menyesatkan kamu daripada jalan allah yang sebenar yang demikian itu diperintahkan allah kepaamu agar kamu bertaqwa
5616911 tidak akan menjadi baik umat ini melainkan dengan mencontohi apa yang boleh menjadi baik umat yang terdahulu
5616912 apakah dia allah yang menunjukkan kepada kebenaran lebih patut berhak kamu ikutinya ataupun kamu hendak mengikut mereka yang tidak memiliki petunjuk melainkan jika siberi petunjuk oleh allah kepadanya maka apakah kamu ini bagaimana kamu mambuat keputusan
5616913 dan sesiapa yang bertaqwa kepada allah akan dibukakan jalan keluar penyelesaian masalahnya baginya dan diberi rezeki kepadanya sehingga tidak teritung banyaknya
5616914 dan kalau sekiranya penduduk sesebuah negeri beriman dan bertaqwa nescaya kami bukakan kepada mereka keberkatan pintu rezeki dari langit dan bumi tetapi mereka mendustakan membelakangi ayat ayat kami maka kami seksa mereka dengan berbagai bagai masalah daripada perbuatan mereka sendiri

5616923 you look like one of those women who lives in a cult in texas
5616924 it is pretty obvious that she was looking forward to her time in the house but her health is the first priority and she is flying back for treatment and more tests
5616925 the most important thing is to get her back with people who care for her it is dreadful but the irony of it is that shilpa shetty was instrumental in inviting jade on the show it was a great oppportunity and something she was really looking forward to

5616927 i love the fraternity brothers because theyre so young and such a contrasting team
5616928 one takes his time to think things out the other one loves to rush and go at a million miles an hour theres definitely tension between the two of them while theyre making decisions during the race
5616929 they are small we wanted to make sure that there wasnt anything to prevent us from putting that pack underneath the seat in front of us when we got on a plane we didnt want something to happen where we got delayed because of our luggage we thought that would help us go faster
5616930 we did extensive research on what to wear what was lightweight and would help us move the fastest
5616931 i think it was the longest i ever went without wearing a logo on my t shirt

5616934 people were a little afraid we were going to pull a borat on them i told them we werent doing borat but what happened there is very very funny its not easy to shoot in places like that because they practically have no television industry
5616935 the teams have no idea how to get from point a to point b there
5616936 they dont know the language its very difficult to get through this country they get so stuck but they find so many fascinating solutions of how to get through everything one of the things the teams do there is go to a real life floating village its insane
5616937 were just happy to continue making the show as it is
5616938 after spending a number of weeks with mr ganz mr aust and members of their team we feel the future success of our company online is guaranteed and what sets them apart is their tactics are measurable they have become our digital agency of record

5616941 in any economy there are people who have money and people who need money this is especially true in a recession greedypeople com simply brings those people together and allows them to have a little fun while also overcoming difficult circumstances
5616942 there are many places where you can find a typist but what if you need something out of the ordinary what if you need a singing telegram delivered or you want 50 people to start picketing in a lawful demonstration by wednesday greedypeople com is where people go to negotiate deals for normal and not so normal services

5616963 squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5616964 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5616965 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5616966 in the end he also became the man who couldnt deliver bush was very slow to realize that he either had been had by musharraf or that musharraf was not up to the task historians will debate this for years
5616967 the new pakistani general hes just been elected not elected this guy took over office
5616968 it wasnt a personal relationship but musharraf tried to play it effectively for domestic advantage
5616969 we pretty much played the musharraf card ad nauseam eventually to pakistans detriment
5616970 so far ive found him to be a man of his word
5616971 the fundamental question i have for president musharraf is will these elections be under emergency rule or law because if they are its going to be hard for well itll be hard for those of us who have belief that hes advanced pakistans democracy to say thats thats still the case
5616972 president bush and vice president cheney backed a discredited dictator which has undercut our ability to work with the new government to eliminate the terrorist sanctuary that has re emerged in pakistans tribal areas
5616973 president musharraf took his country a long way in turning it back from the extremism that was starting to characterize it at the time of sept 11 2001 he also kept his promise to try and help a transition to free and fair elections we didnt agree with everything he did especially the state of emergency but he did take off the military uniform the elections were free and fair
5616974 he tried to play both ends moving against certain terrorist targets but more broadly letting the terrorists increase their influence in his own country he campaigned for democratic reform then staged faulty elections to help himself stay in power
5616975 it took a little while to get the plans out and just how we were going to do this
5616976 a year ago we didnt even have the equipment to move to the units
5616977 the fact that drought assistance has been extended in 32 areas shows that farmers continue to struggle with the drought in many parts of the country despite recent rainfall in certain areas
5616978 from very early on dr nelson has sided with the spirits industry in opposing this measure
5616979 but from the early evidence that we have from the tax office this measure is being successful
5616980 dr nelson needs to explain what impact his opposition to this measure will have on the health of young people and on the sorts of outcomes that we are trying to achieve for the community in making sure that young people have a healthier approach in the way they consume alcohol
5616981 we know the practicalities of working through ppps and the best and most efficient ways of being able to deliver infrastructure and thats what were looking at
5616982 we need to be able to be critical of the data that were actually putting forward
5616983 if were saying that its accurate we shouldnt be scared of scrutiny
5616984 we do actually understand that the efficiency of the public system needs to be addressed over a period of time
5616985 and we can manage the processes internally of retirement to reduce the size of the public sector
5616986 weve got to make sure that government runs effectively and efficiently and that nurses and doctors and teachers and firefighters and ambulance officers those sorts of people are our core priorities
5616987 i dont expect the polls to turn around in the short term
5616988 they are sending a message at the end of the day youve got to get on and govern for the people of this state and do what is right for them
5616989 its a one way ticket to an ofarrell victory at the 2011 election
5616990 the only winner from alp unrest is mr ofarrell and his team
5616991 this is all about morris iemma trying to preserve his leadership using an appalling poll result to shore up his hapless premiership instead of getting the real message that exists in this poll
5616992 offered by the state government for not fixing the problems they face on a daily basis he said

5616998 that particular poll in no small way reflects the enormous amount of respect and regard in this country for the job that mr costello did as treasurer
5616999 it is also a pretty stark reminder how significantly it changed under the very nervous man that is wayne swan our treasurer and indeed prime minister kevin rudd
5617000 i can assure you i am very determined and i will lead us to the next election
5617001 it will take a while before they voters reach the point of deciding when they have had enough defects disappointments and breakdowns before they decide that maybe in hindsight that they didnt do the right thing
5617002 if you have got a small business overdraft a mortgage a credit card you are trying to put petrol in your car you want the government to succeed

5617026 the late training is because we werent members and therefore eac secretariat had to give us the grace period that will enable both countries to implement what is required of the east african customs union

5617028 with our network of volunteers and the great commitment of the red cross movement to cope with this crisis we think we can do more but we consider that adaptation is critical in responding to the impacts of climate change and offers opportunities to support development
5617029 this paper is successful so far because since its establishment it has been received better than we anticipated
5617030 the success of this newspaper is attributed to the good readership it has enjoyed
5617031 the paper started as a bi weekly published on tuesdays and fridays from august last year however on november 16 the same year is when a new issue for sundays hit the streets
5617032 the paper aims at enlightening the masses on new government policies and on how rwandans can work hand in hand with the government and other partners for their benefit
5617033 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5617034 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5617035 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5617036 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5617037 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5617038 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5617039 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5617040 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5617041 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5617042 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5617043 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5617044 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5617045 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5617046 this is really showing people that the casino computer programmer volunteers business world is not elitist but really consumer friendly thoughtful and dynamic with these new views the casino computer programmer volunteers companies of today and tomorrow can move forward
5617047 this book has something for everyone there is a good true story a little suspense solid fact and a great critical analysis of casino computer programmer volunteers operation in moder society
5617048 were thrilled by these sales god knows we need them
5617049 the end of the season has been slow and without much publicity about the best sellers now we have to literally close early because we are running out of stock
5617050 shackleton ranfords book brings many important points about the casino computer programmer volunteers world into focus
5617051 and i myself plan to buy a copy and study it in depth its not often that we come across such a thorough and lucid analysis of casino computer programmer volunteers industry and design
5617052 im floored weve had to send out trucks with double and triple orders just to keep up with the rush one semi alone went to gaynelle williston inc the countrys largest casino computer programmer volunteers investment bureau weve literally made thousands in a matter of hours
5617053 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5617054 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5617055 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5617056 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5617057 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5617058 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5617059 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5617060 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5617061 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5617062 who are open to doing something on the production side
5617063 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5617064 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5617065 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5617066 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5617067 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5617068 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5617069 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5617070 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5617071 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5617072 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5617073 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5617074 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5617075 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5617076 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5617077 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5617078 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5617079 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5617080 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5617081 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5617082 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5617083 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5617084 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5617085 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5617086 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5617087 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5617088 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5617089 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5617090 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5617091 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5617092 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5617093 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5617094 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5617095 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5617096 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5617097 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5617098 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5617099 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5617100 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5617101 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5617102 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5617103 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5617104 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5617105 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5617106 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5617107 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5617108 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5617109 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5617110 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5617111 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5617112 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5617113 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5617114 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5617115 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5617116 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5617117 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5617118 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5617119 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5617120 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5617121 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5617122 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5617123 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5617124 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5617125 akagera national park has quite often suffered fire outbreaks especially during dry spells fires are normally set by poachers who wish to trap wild animals in the burnt area the recent fire outbreak started at 3pm on the night of august 15 and lasted for 38hours before it was controlled on sunday august 17 at exactly 16hours

5617139 capcom is releasing street fighter iv in 2009 which is the 20th anniversary of the game
5617140 the film and game release dates will coincide but im not certain how much of the game will coincide with the story because ours is a very partitioned off origin story of the street fighter universe
5617141 obviously its a cause thats very close to our heart and that made it a cause that we very much wanted to contribute to
5617142 we were thrilled that mary pat was able to visit the cancer center and see some of the work that is supported by football 101
5617143 its a great program thats a lot of fun for those who participate and we truly appreciate the support it garners for our research
5617144 they are obviously lower than we hoped they would be
5617145 if this is an accurate measure of our science education then we have a lot of work to do
5617146 the same pressures that came to bear for schools in math and reading will happen in science
5617147 just the fact that these are being published in newspapers puts tremendous pressure on schools
5617148 we have to seriously look at how we structure the school day because science shouldnt be just mastering a series of facts
5617149 there should be time for students to really explore subjects in depth and conduct the kind of hands on work that gives people a sense as to how science actually happens

5617154 the foreign affairs minister said that he did not want any problems with president obiang and that my case would be closed promptly
5617155 as opposition leader i have become an obstacle for the dictator obiang and that is why they want to get rid of me if they kill me now the whole world will now who gave the execution order the spanish government cannot allow a scandal like this

5617164 four years ago he was a boy in a mans body
5617165 i think david is more mobile has a good boxing brain and a big heart
5617166 over the last 18 months this guy just got stronger and stronger
5617167 every time i hit him i knew id sickened him
5617168 i slept in my own bed im all refreshed and feeling good a lot of guys we didnt even talk to each other sunday i got tired of seeing everybody
5617169 we need more playing time to come together as a team
5617170 you have to play some to tackle better and so well play more this week with our starters the same offensively to get timing especially in the passing game
5617171 after looking at the tape we made too many mental mistakes offensively and defensively both
5617172 its a gradual process and we have to embrace the process win when its time to win
5617173 but we have got to come together definitely by the end of the preseason thats our biggest goal and be hitting on all cylinders at the beginning of the regular season
5617174 even in preseason you get back in a routine and back to familiar things now well be more settled
5617175 we talked forever until 2 3 4 in the morning about life volleyball boyfriends children friends and family to get to know each other
5617176 we knew the off court relationship could help us on court now i realise that when she yells she doesnt do it to make you feel bad but because she wants the best for you
5617177 trying to find the right chemistry is tough we werent at this level in the first year you have to work through the ups and downs like in a marriage when things dont go your way you dont split up you work at it
5617178 its hard to play together for five years aleksandrs is so different and its hard always to be together
5617179 hes from texas so hes got to represent where hes from
5617180 we hadnt injected any new people in there in some time
5617181 i think it would have been a distraction going to the texans
5617182 my family is there a lot of my friends are right around the corner home is right around the corner coming out of high school thats why i went to iowa i kind of wanted to get away from all that so i could stay focused
5617183 coming to carolina its a great place and im happy to be here
5617184 hes making tremendous strides hes come and grasped this scheme like no other
5617185 if you look at him back there and you listen to him make his checks hes so confident you just have a lot of confidence in him as a linebacker taking the call from him hes been putting the work in and he knows what hes doing
5617186 i had to slow down because i was used to going up against these fast receivers
5617187 now im on tight ends where i have to slow down because i have more speeds than those guys so i can be there to make a play on the ball
5617188 hes like a bowling ball with butcher knives on him
5617189 its hard to tackle the guy hes not the biggest guy hes probably not the fastest guy thats probably why he wasnt drafted but then you look what he accomplished at oklahoma state
5617190 he doesnt go down on the first hit if you think you can just hit him with your shoulders and dont wrap him up youve got problems hes going to make yards hes got a very strong base hes got powerful legs
5617191 it meant im a little bit closer to making this team
5617192 i said i want you to catch punts everyday after practice cause i want to get you in a game and see how you react to his credit before the game they took the jugs machine out there because hes never really caught balls under the lights he wanted to be prepared to catch them in a game and he did a good job
5617193 thats what were going to find out in the next two weeks
5617194 thats a tough spot catching punts it looks easy but that ball takes funny turns
5617195 i have to adapt if i want to make the team
5617196 when you have 11 guys out there not on the same page it looks ugly and it looked ugly they came in here and out hit us and thats something we pride ourselves on being a physical team and we took a few punches to the mouth
5617197 its a preseason game you cant take it too hard but at the same time you have to learn something from it
5617198 theres nothing broken on the defense or the offense we just need to do some cleaning up
5617199 it was a series of mistakes and just getting whooped
5617200 and if we dont it is going to be another shellacking because tampa bay has been playing some good ball the past two weeks
5617201 we let it be known with the dodgers that was the one ballclub he had interest in going to that any deal we were going to do was going to be the best baseball deal we could do and it wasnt going to be a financial deal to try to move dollars we just werent happy with the prospect we would be getting back and we chose to hold onto him
5617202 yes i accept that it would have been very helpful
5617203 but i hope you understand that things like that dont get done by the click of the finger
5617204 theres considerable technology and work to be done its much more complex than that
5617205 the weekends torrential rain and flooding was not a freak event but rather part of a pattern that has emerged over the past few years
5617206 the executive is doing its best to respond to the aftermath of flooding but surely it is now time for a more strategic approach
5617207 if as seems to be the case outbursts of torrential rain are becoming a characteristic of northern irelands climate government departments and agencies should have plans in place to minimise both the chances of flooding and the disruption which follows floods
5617208 when the range of departments and agencies involved is considered doe drd northern ireland fire and rescue service northern ireland ambulance service psni roads service rivers agency local government there is a case to be made for a body to co ordinate not just the response to flooding but how best to reduce its likelihood
5617209 the recently published pitt report into the 2007 floods in england has emphasised the need for co ordinated planning and responses both in terms of addressing flood risk and in establishing best practice in the event of flooding
5617210 its recommendations should be carefully considered by the executive and any lessons for northern ireland should be learned quickly
5617211 the fact that from thursday onwards we had additional staff in brought in extra staff for the telephone centres prepared tens of thousands of sand bags we put in place and purchased additional pumping equipment for the fire service and rivers agency
5617212 but you have got to accept that when you get one months rainfall in seven hours theres a limit to what could be done
5617213 the emergency services did plan for this they met on thursday and on friday they did prepare and they did communicate with each other
5617214 we see sensationalist headlines about the real estate market every day now
5617215 yes that does get attention which does sell advertising that is how the media makes money so lets review some of the facts and opportunities that will help you make money
5617216 had huge run ups in prices driven by speculators and flippers
5617217 we must remember that all markets go through cycles like the dot com bust the housing market will in fact correct itself there are some incredible opportunities to buy great properties that will bring handsome returns over time
5617218 we must also remember that real estate markets are local
5617219 there was never any debate of anybody else doing it
5617220 a lot of leaders of real estate companies would be petrified standing there when the lights turn on whether they have a script or not
5617221 done poorly i think it hurts you more than it helps you
5617222 its classic producing work that most people in real estate have not done
5617223 there are always people on your teams who are scared to death
5617224 when you tell the truth people may not like it give dan a lot of credit the culture of our company has always been more straight shooting and open with honesty at all levels
5617225 we believed that the story wasnt really being told well in our market and people get so confused about the local market versus the national market and what that all means
5617226 we decided we needed to take a leadership role and be a thought leader in our market
5617227 the rest of the country has clearly caught the real estate bug
5617228 the expired and withdrawn listings continue to set new records signaling frustration from sellers
5617229 property values have been driven down by large numbers of foreclosures aggressive new home incentives and very motivated sellers of resale properties
5617230 we believe that atlanta home values have actually dropped 8 to 10 percent from last year
5617231 theres no better time to buy a new home in atlanta than right now
5617232 there is no guarantee that these wonderful buying conditions will last
5617233 it is an election year we have a potential recession looming inflation could return due to gas prices and natural disasters or terrorist events could occur at any time
5617234 we will actually see a sellers market return in 2010
5617235 resale inventory will be back to normal foreclosures will be down and new home engines will not be able to crank up and start quick enough to catch up
5617236 there is no doubt that it is a great time to buy in atlanta georgia
5617237 whether you want a resale a new home or a foreclosure property we can help
5617238 to get the word out to consumers about the opportunities for buyers in todays housing markets
5617239 backed by statistics and solid logic to make a very plausible case for buying a home now
5617240 people can cut right to whatever piece theyre interested in or come back and refresh their memory on what was said floyd said
5617241 they can listen for two minutes and they have what they need
5617242 a lot of businesses around the brokerage business are using these videos extensively
5617243 they dont have access to this kind of data were just trying to do our part to be the thought leader in the marketplace and help our agents get the most accurate message out to clients and customers
5617244 i just went out there to qualify and that was my first aim and i did just that
5617245 im just going out there to lay it all on the track because this is my last individual race and hope for the best
5617246 but im ok i just need some rest ahead of the semi final and final
5617247 amphibious tours offer excitement and a genuinely memorable experience but i am focusing also on the quality of the tour the accuracy of the guided commentary which will be conducted by fully trained personnel and the safety and comfort of our passengers
5617248 despite many people experiencing both internal and external flooding ni water can assure customers that their drinking water is completely safe
5617249 the only exception is an interruption to supply for customers in the south down area this is due to a damaged outlet main which was the result of rain damage over the weekend to the cavan road rathfriland
5617250 we sample and analyse drinking water 365 days a year to check the quality of water at our customers taps our water supply is stringently monitored and this scrutiny has remained in place during this flooding period
5617251 such was the deluge that it was greater than anyone expected
5617252 obviously theres a very serious failing when flash flooding is able to close that junction and fill up that underpass with water
5617253 we will need to ascertain what happened and make sure it doesnt happen again
5617254 obviously there has to be a detailed inquiry why the road wasnt tested for how it would cope with inclement weather conditions and it shows that the drd is going to have to reconsider developments in future in light of the flash flooding we have been experiencing
5617255 there did not seem to be that much water at all then all of a sudden it started flooding
5617256 at that stage i was on the roof the water was up here to my waist it was frightening
5617257 the emergency services were absolutely fantastic this one guy mark who was one of the firemen he was as brave as brave can be its thanks to him that i am standing here today
5617258 absolutely i cant swim at the best of times when i saw the fireman getting in and seen how quickly he was submerged into the water i thought thats here i am bang in the middle of this
5617259 it was amazing the water was coming in from both ends and obviously coming down from the street it was frightening
5617260 i must pay a warm tribute to the public spirited actions of the nine local farmers who answered the call for help of their distressed neighbours
5617261 their admirable willingness to respond in the circumstances and the effectiveness of their actions is in the best traditions of the farming community in the mid tyrone area
5617262 i must however be critical of the doe planning service for granting approval for these two housing developments in the first place
5617263 however i believe appropriate action by the rivers agency can prevent it happening in the future the response of the farmers demonstrated that a lowering of the river bed at the western end of the village can enable the water to escape before it reaches dangerous levels
5617264 i will be asking the rivers agency to take immediate steps to ensure that this type of flooding is averted in future indeed with a little foresight it could have been prevented in the first place

5617350 it is condescending to treat muslims like excitable children who cannot cope with the probing mocking treatment we hand out to christianity judaism and buddhism it is perfectly consistent to protect muslims from bigotry while challenging the bigotries and absurdities within their holy texts
5617351 i am very disappointed to hear that my publishers random house have cancelled another authors novel apparently because of their concerns about possible islamic reprisals
5617352 this is censorship by fear and it sets a very bad precedent indeed
5617353 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
5617354 the individual is handicapped by coming face to face with a conspiracy so monstrous he cannot believe it exists
5617355 elie wiesel won the nobel peace prize in 1986 he is generally accepted as a witness to the jewish holocaust and more specifically as a witness to the legendary nazi extermination gas chambers
5617356 zionism is an expression of jewish refusal to assimilate if the jews have suffered it is because they have regarded themselves as a chosen people
5617357 great leap forward during which many skilled farmers were herded into
5617358 those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it
5617359 schoolchildren have long been taught that jews have always been surrounded by enemies and that their victory over five arab states in the 1948 war of independence was a new miracle of david and goliath proportions
5617360 but now officially approved textbooks make plain that many of the most common israeli beliefs are as much myth as fact the new books say for example that it was the israelis who had the military edge in the war of independence
5617361 the rise of the holocaust to the top of the jewish agenda was by no means a spontaneous development
5617362 consequence of decisions made by communal leaders in response to their appraisals of current communal needs
5617363 examples of how the holocaust has been used as a weapon to promote policies favorable to israel are extensive
5617364 prison enclosures are to provide no shelter or other comforts
5617365 it is hard to escape the conclusion that dwight eisenhower was a war criminal of epic proportions his def policy killed more germans in peace than were killed in the european theater
5617366 for years we have blamed the 1 7 million missing german pows on the russians until now no one dug too deeply witnesses and survivors have been interviewed by the author one allied officer compared the american camps to buchenwald
5617367 huddled close together for warmth behind the barbed wire was a most awesome sight nearly 100 000 haggard apathetic dirty gaunt blank staring men clad in dirty gray uniforms and standing ankle deep in mud water was a major problem yet only 200 yards away the river rhine was running bankfull
5617368 my protests regarding treatment of the german defs were met with hostility or indifference and when i threw our ample rations to them over the barbed wire i was threatened making it clear that it was our deliberate policy not to adequately feed them
5617369 when they caught me throwing c rations over the fence they threatened me with imprisonment one captain told me that he would shoot me if he saw me again tossing food to the germans some of the men were really only boys 13 years of age some of the prisoners were old men drafted by hitler in his last ditch stand i understand that average weight of the prisoners at andernach was 90 pounds i have received threats nevertheless this has liberated me for i may now be heard when i relate the horrible atrocity i witnessed as a prison guard for one of ikes death camps along the rhine
5617370 by the way he was next or nearly so to the last in his class this article was first printed in 1990 but we thought it was meaningful to reprint it now
5617371 the holocaust framework has promoted as well a belligerent stance toward any criticism of israel
5617372 the gnostics derived their leading doctrines and ideas from plato and philo the zend avesta the kabbalah and the sacred books of india and egypt and thus introduced into the bosom of christianity the cosmological and theosophical speculations which had formed the larger portion of the ancient religions of the orient joined to those of the egyptian greek and jewish doctrines which the neo platonists had equally adopted in the occident
5617373 it is admitted that the cradle of gnosticism is probably to be looked for in syria and even in palestine
5617374 the jewish greek school of alexandria is known only by two of its chiefs aristobulus and philo both jews of alexandria in egypt
5617375 aristobulus declared that all the facts and details of the jewish scriptures were so many allegories concealing the most profound meanings and that plato had borrowed from them all his finest ideas
5617376 these jews had had with the orient at two different periods intimate relations familiarizing them with the doctrines of asia and especially of chaldea and persia
5617377 from egypt or persia the new platonists borrowed the idea and the gnostics received it from them that man in his terrestrial career is successively under the influence of the moon mercury venus sun mars jupiter and saturn until he finally reaches the elysian fields
5617378 in the early 1930s walter duranty of the new york times was in moscow covering joe stalin the way joe stalin wanted to be covered
5617379 now imagine that a major newspaper had had a correspondent in berlin during roughly the same period who hobnobbed with hitler portrayed him in a flattering light and denied that jews were being mistreated thereby not only concealing but materially assisting the regimes persecution
5617380 there you have an epitome of what is lamely called media bias
5617381 not only persecution of jews but any critical mention of jewish power in the media and politics is roundly condemned as anti semitism
5617382 its permissible to discuss the power of every other group from the black muslims to the christian right but the much greater power of the jewish establishment is off limits
5617383 you can read articles in jewish controlled publications from the times to commentary blaming christianity for the holocaust or accusing pope pius xii of indifference to it but dont look for articles in any major publication that wants to stay in business examining the jewish role in communism and liberalism however temperately
5617384 the position the jewish people occupy today in the world despite the enormous losses is ten times stronger than what it was twenty years ago
5617385 since hitler emerged from obscurity and became the fuhrer of germany we have heard a great deal about racialism and the nazi theory of the herrenvolk
5617386 have become used during the centuries to regarding themselves as a herrenvolk the twentieth century the century of auschwitz has also achieved he first stage in the recognition of multi racial partnership
5617387 an attempt to make a competent objective and truthful investigation of the extermination question is surely the most precarious venture that an historian or demographer could undertake today
5617388 der gelbe fleck die ausrotung von 500 000 deutschen juden
5617389 four weeks in the hands of hitlers hell hounds the nazi murder camp of dachau
5617390 the jews stand by great britain and will fight on the side of the democracies the jewish agency is ready to enter into immediate arrangements for utilizing jewish manpower technical ability resources etc
5617391 the war with the soviet union has in the meantime created the possibility of disposing of other territories for the final solution in consequence the fuhrer has decided that the jews should be evacuated not to madagascar but to the east madagascar need no longer therefore be considered in connection with the final solution
5617392 the biggest and most horrible crime ever committed in the whole history of the world
5617393 the majority of the german jews succeeded in leaving germany
5617394 2 200 000 have migrated to the soviet union since 1939 to escape from the nazis
5617395 at the outset of the war jews were amongst the first evacuated from the western regions
5617396 thanks tot he evacuation the majority 80 of he jews in the ukraine white russia lithuania and latvia before the arrival of the germans were rescued
5617397 from these scans we could clearly identify the largely undisturbed horizontal stratigraphic layering better known as horizons of the soil under the camp site
5617398 we know from scans of grave sites and other sites with known soil disturbances such as quarries when this natural layering is massively disrupted or missing altogether
5617399 historians say that the bodies were exhumed and cremated towards the end of the treblinka camps use in 1943 but we found no indication that any mass graves ever existed
5617400 personally i dont think there was an extermination camp there at all
5617401 world war ii was a war to renew jewish domination of germany and central europe and for the maintenance of the power and glory of the british jewish empire
5617402 it never would have started had not roosevelt and the half jew bullitt guaranteed to britain and france all of americas resources which meant first repeal of our neutrality act and supplying them with munitions and bombers without stint second in time the extension of unlimited credit third the use of our fleet in the pacific to protect british french and dutch interests if these did not suffice for victory then our young men as air pilots and our fleet to be sent to europe and lastly if world jewry and the british jewish empire could not win without them millions of our lads to die in europes babbles
5617403 the premeditated killing of human beings by another save in self defense is murder a crime against christianity morality humanity and civilization and this applies with greatest guilt to the wholesale slaughter by one nation of the people of another who have not attacked or harmed them
5617404 they plotted to get bonnet out of the french cabinet and to substitute the jews reynaud blum and mandel the ardent but unsuccessful courtship of stalin and soviet russia was insisted upon by roosevelt world jewry and war mongers of america england and france
5617405 one of the reasons for the roosevelt eden plot to overthrow the chamberlain government and remove bonnet from the french cabinet was because they would not agree to pay the price stalin demanded to encircle and defeat germany at roosevelts and the jews insistence england and france guaranteed the boundaries of poland in order to encircle germany and renew jewish control this guarantee of the boundaries of poland was the direct cause of world war ii it knowingly necessitated it
5617406 i was one of 34 prisoners alive out of 150 000 who had been put there
5617407 almost 3 000 prisoners died in maunhausen after the americans liberated us on may 5 1945
5617408 polish communist authorities used the number because it was established by a postwar soviet commission on nazi crimes
5617409 why is there such special treatment for an atheistic materialistic people who are self professed christ hating antichrists and who have done little more in history than act as parasites against the host nations where they have lived
5617410 the jews as outcasts jews have been a wondering people from the time of the beginning
5617411 at other times they were the consequence of economic situation which the authorities believed would be improved if the jews were removed almost always the bands were only temporary as below the culminate impact on the psychic on the jewish people however has been traumatic and may very well be indelible the following is a list far from complete hardly a major jewish community has not been expelled by its host country only to be let back in again later to be expelled once more
5617412 are not the jews the inventors of the chosen people myth the theory of hell being in the nether regions of the earth or any other place where the devil resides to burn human souls after death of the body is jewish and they obtained it from their ancestral devil god nergal shar usur a son of king nebuchadnezzar ii of babylon
5617413 but whoever will deny me before men i also will deny him before my father who is in heaven
5617414 the world is taciturn and it was only recently that we heard the polish foreign minister col beck say in many interviews in geneva and in his own country and in berlin that there were one million jews too many in poland
5617415 i do not wish to dwell on this subject any longer
5617416 if we go on and take the jews of roumania lithuania and austria into consideration then we have practically the same picture and it is therefore no exaggeration at all when i say that today six million i am not talking about the jews in persia and marocco and in such countries which can only give very uncertain information and about which very little is heard nowadays that in this part of the world six million jews are condemned to be crowded in places where they are not wanted human beings for whom the world is divided into countries in which they cannot live and countries which they are not allowed to enter
5617417 just one word about russia there are around three million jews in russia we have only very little contact with them russia is at present a closed country the situation there has i think materially improved namely due to the fact that many people who could not be incorporated into russias present society are about to disappear
5617418 but in the meaning in which the term jewry is understood by us it is disappearing in russia
5617419 with great effort we succeeded in getting one thousand or twelve hundred zionist families out of russia who had been arrested there and were incarcerated in siberia prisons
5617420 the six million whom i mentioned before are condemned to live from hand to mouth they do not know today what will happen tomorrow i am not talking about organized anti semitism and will assume for a moment that most countries are behaving quite amicably but there are a number of objective reasons purely objective reasons leading to a situation in those parts of the world where the jewish community is crushed and the jews are made the flotsam of the world where they are economically ground to dust
5617421 when saying this to you i do not wish to involve your emotions but these things are not widely known although it is common knowledge that the situation of the jews is not a very happy one i think that the real circumstances are not understood this is why i have taken the liberty to dwell a little more comprehensively on this subject this involves after all the fate of six million human beings
5617422 i took it upon myself to convey to the british government in writing and verbally the resolution of mutual assistance passed by the geneva conference
5617423 he received me not only cordially but he was also full of confidence with respect to the war his first words after he welcomed me were about as follows well dr weizmann we have as good as beaten them already
5617424 i was not quite of the same opinion at the time but i did not say so
5617425 the british government refused to believe that six million jews had been killed in europe
5617426 from across the sea six million men and women call to us for help and eight hundred thousand little children cry for bread
5617427 in the face of death in the throes of starvation there is no place for mental distinctions of creed no place for physical differentiations of race in this catastrophe when
5617428 since the second world war jews have been treated with silk gloves without auschwitz there would be no israel
5617429 no gassing took place in any camp on german soil
5617430 there does not exist then anything like a written order signed by hitler for the extermination of the jews in europe
5617431 the end policy in regard to the jews is the emigration of all jews living in the territory of the old reich
5617432 on november 12 1938 goring had mentioned the question of madagascar himmler himself had dreamed of that since 1934 a witness assures us after the armistice of june 1940 surrender of france the idea was propounded by the foreign ministry and approved by himmler as well as by hitler himself
5617433 the jews must leave europe the best thing is that they go to russia
5617434 when did you first learn that five million jews had been exterminated
5617435 most important supply centers the second in economic importance was the lodz ghetto because it manufactured all kinds of goods and in particular its textile industries constituted support of great value to the german economy
5617436 the death rate in the camps must be reduced at all costs
5617437 every means will be used to lower the death rates
5617438 100 000 jews to work on a new pursuit plane program
5617439 a large boiler for the production of superheated steam was injected into the interior of the rooms the doors are closed hermetically and the long asphyxiation of the victims by the steam begins at the start screams came from inside they die down slowly after 15 minutes the executions are completed
5617440 the jews were ordered to undress as though to take a bath they were led in fact into a building that could hold hundreds of people the water was filled up to their necks then a powerful electric current was sent into the metal flooring and within a few seconds all the jews thousands at a time were dead
5617441 zyklon b is utterly unsuited for the purposes of systematic mass murder
5617442 i traveled to poland to investigate the alleged execution gas chamber facilities at the three concentration camps of auschwitz birkenau and majdanek my forensic analysis and subsequent report proves beyond any shadow of a doubt that there were no gas execution facilities operated by the nazis at these sites
5617443 1 765 000 jews were gassed at birkenau between april 1942 and april 1944
5617444 the extermination thesis stands or falls with the allegation that auschwitz was a death factory
5617445 we have provided the definitive proof that there were no execution gas chambers utilized for genocidal purposes by the germans at these wartime camps the simple fact is that the holocaust story is not true
5617446 not until the holocaust did anti semitism become taboo there was a time when anti semitic speeches were an open factor in national political campaigns the holocaust puts a taboo on overt anti semitism among upper level statesmen and publicists
5617447 the shattering effect of the holocaust on the christian conscience results in a feeling of collective indebtedness to the jews
5617448 in the final moths of the war the camps received no food supplies at all and starvation claimed an increasing number of victims
5617449 gen kaltenbrunner allowed the red cross to distribute relief packages and one red cross delegate was authorized to stay in each camp as an observer
5617450 the holocaust was the murder of six million jews including two million children holocaust denial is a second murder of those same six million first their lives were extinguished then their deaths a person who denies the holocaust becomes part of the crime of the holocaust itself
5617451 the policy pursued by the german government resulted in the killing of six million jews of which four million were killed in the extermination institutions
5617452 in some instances attempts were made to utilize the fat from the bodies of the victims in the commercial manufacture of soap
5617453 historians have concluded that soap was not made from human fat when so many people deny the holocaust ever happened why give them something to use against the truth
5617454 the public still repeats time after time the silly story that at wannsee the extermination of the jews was arrived at
5617455 little of what was said there was executed in detail
5617456 in the new edition all references in the text to a hitler decision or hitler order for the final solution have been systematically excised buried at the bottom of a single footnote stand the solitary reference chronology and circumstances point to a hitler decision before the summer ended in the new edition decisions were not made and orders were not given
5617457 from 1942 to 1945 certainly an auschwitz but probably overall more jews were killed by so called natural causes than by unnatural ones
5617458 four million people suffered and died here at the hands of the nazi murderers between the years 1940 and 1945
5617459 many questions remain open all in all how many bodies were cremated in auschwitz how many died there all told what was the national religious and ethnic breakdown in this commonwealth of victims how many of them were condemned to die a natura death and how many were deliberately slaughtered and what was the proportion of jews among those murdered in cold blood among these gassed we have simply no answers to these questions at this time
5617460 the second world war is being fought for the defense of the fundamentals of judaism
5617461 stated that america and the world jews had forced england into war
5617462 whenever an american or a filipino fell at bataan or corrugator or at any other of the now historic spots where macarthurs men put up their remarkable fight their survivors could have said with truth the real reason that boy went to his death was because hitlers anti semitic movement succeeded in germany can you not see it world war ii was because germany and its people were being successful in their attempts to throw off the international jewish bankers rule of their country god what does it take for america to understand
5617463 if but a fraction of the atrocities reported were accurate then many thousands of defenseless jewish non combatants men women and children were butchered after september 1939
5617464 dr aaron ohrenstein chief rabbi of bavaria was sentenced to one year in prison for fraud falsification of sworn statements of the non existent victims of nazi terrorism
5617465 erich koch gauleiter of ukraine stood accused of responsibil ity or complicity in gas chamber and concentration camp death of 4 000 000 russians 160 000 jews and 72 000 poles
5617466 about 500 000 of israels 2 6 million jews had been in a nazi concentration camp
5617467 of the 3 500 000 polish jews who lived in that country before the war not less than three million were murdered by the germans the total number of jews surviving in poland is only between 70 000 and 80 000
5617468 no document no written or even spoken evidence connects hitler directly to the wannsee decision
5617469 it is not intended to evacuate jews over 65 years of age
5617470 jews who are serious war wounded cases and jews with war decorations
5617471 presents the massacre of six million jews as a myth perpetrated by jews to elicit sympathy
5617472 the incontrovertible evidence is that hitler ordered on november 30 1941 that there was to be no liquidation of the jews
5617473 sources for the study of the gas chambers are at once rare and unreliable
5617474 most of what is known is based on the depositions of nazi officials and executioners at postwar trials and on the memory of survivors and bystanders this testimony must be screened carefully since it can be influenced by subjective factors of great complexity
5617475 excavations at the killing sites and in their immediate environs
5617476 for chemical technical reasons the claimed mass gassings with hydrocyanic acid in the alleged gas chambers in auschwitz did not take place the supposed facilities for mass killing in auschwitz and birkenau were not suitable for this purpose
5617477 the present war gives germany the opportunity and also the duty of solving the jewish problem in europe
5617478 to promote the evacuation of the jews from europe in closest cooperation with the agencies of the reichsf hrer ss himmler is still in force
5617479 the number of jews deported in this way to the east did not suffice to cover the labor needs
5617480 at the end of this war all jews would have to leave europe this was an unalterable decision of the f hrer hitler and also the only way to master this problem as only a global and comprehensive solution could be applied and individual measures would not help very much
5617481 deportations of jews to the east are a further step on the way of the total solution the deportation to the polish general government is a temporary measure the jews will be moved on further to the occupied soviet eastern territories as soon as the technical conditions for it are given
5617482 most of the memoirs and reports of holocaust survivors are full of preposterous verbosity graphomanic exaggeration dramatic effects over estimated self inflation dilettante philosophizing would be lyricism unchecked rumors bias partisan attacks and apologies
5617483 the f hrer has repeatedly declared to him lammers that he wants to see the solution of the jewish problem postponed until after the war is over
5617484 the jews are interested in europe for economic reasons but europe must reject them if only out of self interest because the jews are racially tougher after this war is over i will rigorously hold to the view that the jews will have to leave and emigrate to madagascar or some other jewish national state
5617485 camp physicians must use all means at their disposal to significantly reduce the death rate in the various camps
5617486 the camp commandants the camp doctors are to see to it that the working conditions at the various labor places are improved as much as possible
5617487 the reichsf hrer ss heinrich himmler has ordered that the death rate absolutely must be reduced
5617488 as i have already pointed out every means must be used to lower the death rate in the camp
5617489 an entire industry with handsome profits for writers researchers film makers monument builders museum planners and even politicians
5617490 if the holocaust can be shown to be a zionist myth the strongest of all weapons in israels propaganda armory collapses
5617491 with regard to israel the holocaust may be used to forestall political criticism and suppress debate it reinforces the sense of jews as an eternally beleaguered people who can rely for their defense only upon themselves the invocation of the suffering endured by the jews under the nazis often takes the place of rational argument and is expected to convince doubters of the legitimacy of current israeli government policy
5617492 every jew somewhere in his being should set apart a zone of hate healthy virile hate for what the german personifies and for what persists in the german
5617493 through videotaped interviews painstaking attention to personnel files and banal documents not normally consulted by historians and spurred by a keen sense of personal mission rigg has turned up an unexplored and confounding chapter in the history of the holocaust the extent of his findings has surprised scholars
5617494 the revelation that germans of jewish blood knowing the nazi regime for what it was served hitler as uniformed members of his armed forces must come as a profound shock it will surprise even professional historians of the nazi years
5617495 startling and unexpected riggs study conclusively demonstrates the degree of flexibility in german policy toward the mischlinge the extent of hitlers involvement and most importantly that not all who served in the armed forces were anti semitic even as their service aided the killing process
5617496 riggs extensive knowledge and the preliminary conclusions drawn from his research impressed me greatly i firmly believe that his in depth treatment of the subject of german soldiers of jewish descent in the wehrmacht will lead to new perspectives on this portion of 20 th century german military history
5617497 an impressively researched work with important implications for hotly debated questions rigg tells some exquisitely poignant stories of individual human experiences that complicate our picture of state and society in the third reich
5617498 an impressive work filled with interesting stories by helping us better understand nazi racial policy at the margins i e its impact on certain members of the german military riggs study clarifies the central problems of nazi jewish policies overall
5617499 an illuminating and provocative study that merits a wide readership and is sure to be much discussed
5617500 an outstanding job of research and analysis riggs book will add a great deal to our understanding of the german military of the place of jews and people of jewish descent in the nazi state and of the holocaust it forces us to deal with the full complex range of possible actions and reactions by individuals caught up in the nazi system
5617501 with the skill of a master detective bryan rigg reveals the surprising and largely unknown story of germans of jewish origins in the nazi military his work contributes to our understanding of the complexity of faith and identity in the third reich
5617502 a major piece of scholarship which traces the peculiar twists and turns of nazi racial policy toward men in the wehrmacht often in the highest ranks who had partly jewish backgrounds rigg has uncovered personal stories and private archives which literally nobody knew existed his book will be an important contribution to german history
5617503 an original groundbreaking and significant contribution to the history of the wehrmacht and nazi germany
5617504 the jewish people as a whole will be its own messiah it will attain world dominion by the dissolution of other races by the abolition of frontiers the annihilation of monarchy and by the establishment of a world republic in which the jews will everywhere exercise the privilege of citizenship in this new world order the children of israel will furnish all the leaders without encountering opposition the governments of the different peoples forming the world republic will fall without difficulty into the hands of the jews it will then be possible for the jewish rulers to abolish private property and everywhere to make use of the resources of the state thus will the promise of the talmud be fulfilled in which is said that when the messianic time is come the jews will have all the property of the whole world in their hands
5617505 this is not an uncommon impression and one finds it sometimes among jews as well as christians that judaism is the religion of the hebrew bible it is of course a fallacious impression judaism is not the religion of the bible
5617506 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
5617507 the individual is handicapped by coming face to face with a conspiracy so monstrous he cannot believe it exists
5617508 ik trek het mij persoonlijk aan dat u de waarde van uw beleggingen zo hebt zien kelderen
5617509 de overgrote meerderheid van aandeelhouders groot en klein en ook van onze klanten is gelukkig en steunt ons
5617510 kunnen wij conclusies aan deze bijeenkomst verbinden kunnen wij ons erop beroepen
5617511 dit soort avonden zullen we op reguliere basis voor u organiseren
5617512 eigenlijk heb ik niet zo veel grote zorgen over dit bedrijf alle financi le fondsen hebben het momenteel zwaar ik dacht dat ik fortis op het dieptepunt kocht op 12 euro als ik een zorg heb gaat die over het geringe vertrouwen dat er bestaat in de financi le sector in het algemeen maar ik denk dat in 2009 en 2010 het vertrouwen weer terug zal keren
5617513 wat gaan ze doen om het geschonden vertrouwen van de aandeelhouders te herstellen
5617514 een speciale aandeelhoudersvergadering zoals door de veb wordt voorgesteld is naar mijn mening overdreven er zijn wel enkele onderdelen uit het tienpuntenplan van de veb die volgens mij belangrijk zijn fortis zou bijvoorbeeld de risico en controlesystemen moeten versterken ook zou het bedrijf moeten werken aan de transparantie en die verbeteren zoals is voorgesteld
5617515 ik erger me groen en geel aan de mediahetze die dit bedrijf treft de georkestreerde campagne van de veb beleggersvereniging red heeft de problemen waarin fortis verkeert verergerd het begon met de kritiek op de beloning van bestuursvoorzitter votron vervolgens stapt meneer slagter directeur van de veb red het fortiskantoor binnen met een cameraploeg van het journaal in zijn kielzog en dan komt de beschuldiging van misleiding aan het adres van de raad van bestuur allemaal negatieve kritiek die niet het belang van de aandeelhouders heeft gediend
5617516 wanneer houdt de veb nu eens op met die hetze
5617517 votron moet terugkeren als bestuursvoorzitter hij is een fantastische vent een ziener met amerikaanse doortastendheid alleen hij is in staat om fortis weer uit de problemen te krijgen het is een schande dat hij het veld heeft moeten ruimen
5617518 flink verlies ik heb mn aandelen gekocht voor ruim 24 euro nu staat de koers onder de 10
5617519 de situatie met de kredietcrisis bezorgt alle beleggers veel onzekerheid maar voor de aandeelhouders van dit bedrijf is het extra pijnlijk dat het bestuur anders dan beloofd toch zijn dividendbeleid heeft gewijzigd het dividend zou dit jaar gelijk blijven en wat heeft men gedaan het interimdividend is geschrapt
5617520 mijn aandelenbelang is te klein om echt boos te zijn maar ik ben erg benieuwd of het management eigenlijk zelf weet of alle leed nu is geschikt de onverwachte kapitaalmaatregelen van eind juni bewijzen dat de raad van bestuur er goed in is zaken te onderschatten
5617521 we have to look at the justice system which the deputy justice minister said was not working the problem is the justice system itself the pac is opposed to the disbandment of the scorpions corruption is a crime and we have to use whatever means at our disposal to fight corruption we have to cherish the successes of the scorpions
5617522 you say the pac is against the disbandment of the scorpions which pac are you referring to
5617523 the anc western cape places on record that it supports the dissolution of the scorpions
5617524 the anc western cape notes the ancs commitment to combating crime in south africa is an ongoing commitment
5617525 i dont know the individual members of the scorpions but ive met some black members and if they come from apartheid then i come from the moon

5617530 it occurred to me that you could make a map a whole book of maps detailing all possible routes of bank robbery within the underground foundations of a city what basements to tunnel through what walls can be hammered down you make a labyrinth of well placed incisions and the city is yours perforated from below by robbers it rips to pieces the city is a maze of unrealized break ins
5617531 recently however soil ecology has developed to the point where we can open the lid on the black box of underground processes we can begin to understand how micro organisms maintain the structure and fertility of the soil we learn that symbiotic relationships between plants and micro organisms are not the exception but the rule
5617532 the bail out itself isnt what scares investors per se as these government sponsored enterprises gses have always been implicitly backed by the us government however the fact that they have to be bailed out doesnt bode well for the housing financial sector and more specifically the mortgage related investments that sparked the credit crunch in the first place
5617533 the us is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come

5617835 based on these dates the average duration of the summer season was 152 days or just less than 5 months
5617836 the shortest summer season was only 118 days in 1983 which was the year that had the earliest ending date the longest summer season was 195 days which occurred in 1995
5617837 ranged from the least amount of 24 75 inches in 1987 to the greatest amount of 74 85 inches in 1968 the average amount was 40 86 inches
5617838 if two things happen at the same time it doesnt mean one thing caused the other
5617839 but its well known that particulate matter has the potential to affect how clouds behave and this kind of evidence makes the argument for a stronger link between pollution and heavier rainfall
5617840 a 65 percent probability of an above normal season and a 25 percent probability of a near normal season this means there is a 90 percent chance of a near or above normal season
5617841 the outlook is a general guide to the overall seasonal hurricane activity
5617842 it does not predict whether where or when any of these storms may hit land
5617843 my forecast is that two or three storms will bring at least tropical force winds to the coastline between florida and new england including one or two that bring hurricane force winds and one major hurricane
5617844 at least 7 10 days with disruptions or threats of disruptions
5617845 greatest threat of higher than average tropical storm and hurricane impact on the east coast of the united states with emphasis on the carolinas northward
5617846 and given the errors are these full season forecasts doing more harm than good
5617847 seasonal hurricane forecasts are inherently very uncertain and impossible to accurately predict critical details such as track intensity size and impact of any tropical cyclone months or weeks in advance
5617848 look doctor youve made these forecasts and you were wrong once
5617849 you made the forecast and you were wrong twice are you going to continue to make these forecasts
5617850 are the inevitable result of a culture where seasonal hurricane forecasts which are not very good are excessively hyped by both the forecasters and the media
5617851 the forecasters have set them selves up for such shrill condemnations by putting out these very public forecasts complete with press conferences but not properly emphasizing the uncertainties and low skill of their forecasts

5617945 it is an issue of significant magnitude and it does need proper assessment and all governments working together to minimise the risks and ensure there is as little damage as possible

5618037 i have been here a while so ive seen when they see rookies come in and catch a couple balls and everyone gets excited
5618038 i dont think its fair for people to look at it and say all of a sudden that he is going to be the next steve smith and compare him to some of the greats
5618039 you kind of have to give people an opportunity to get adjusted to this league i think we also have to put him in a position to make plays thats something this year that will be very important for us to get guys involved and call plays for them
5618040 the biggest thing for me every time i get an opportunity is to do great things for this team

5618046 we need to find a spot for this guy somewhere
5618047 thats about it just from playing last year you understand that brians going to play at running back and theres not really much room for a lot of other guys to play you just know that you just want to play football you want to get in the game so any time theyre telling you they want to put you on the football field thats a good thing
5618048 im not going to say i expected it but i was ready for it
5618049 he has to be able to block or at least sustain a block where hes not getting pushed back and then understand his leverage of that
5618050 then he has to be effective in the pass game and be able to catch the football and the handful of times that we give him the ball during the season he has to be productive with those we ask our fullback to be a good special teams player or at least a contributor so that ends up being the main part
5618051 the thing he has improved at most is we knew he could run the football but hes a special teams player he deserves an opportunity hes a big kid who wants to be on the field and he doesnt really care where he plays he just wants to play so well give him a shot
5618052 i think its something that hes going to have to work hard to be able to do in such a quick time
5618053 tony is an athletic guy hes also a big guy so definitely can take a pounding and he can do it its just being able to do it in a week and be really good at it its probably going to be tough youll be able to see what he can do when he gets in there on friday
5618054 maybe it would have been better earlier but thats not what it is they did it now studying the position isnt really the thing playing running back you know the fullback position most things are the same you just know it because youre in the same meeting room its not really much of a change pass plays youre still doing the same thing on every pass play the only thing that changes is the run blocking and its not that hard the guys going to come to you its more about just wanting to do it
5618055 surprise me no i kind of came in here expecting a lot of curveballs and twists and turns
5618056 for me now its a four man race instead of three
5618057 i just told them this could be your last at bat as a team
5618058 after merrell hit the home run i thought we were in good shape
5618059 i knew it was gone because i hit it long
5618060 nobody is going to beat them no way its just not going to happen
5618061 we feel like were playing very well right now but you have to keep in mind its single elimination
5618062 going against greece and going against spain it was really easy to get up for
5618063 and we could have easily came in and had one of those games where we make excuses but we didnt take a step backwards today and that was good it was really good
5618064 i was like damn because i knew what was coming after that especially with what had been going on with him not running out a play
5618065 they scrutinize the small things here the way i look at it just play hard just play well all that is forgotten about if he performs well theyll forget about it
5618066 as of late its been all love youve got to understand the city hasnt had a championship in a while and the fans are very passionate about their sports ive learned there are things you just cant say even if the statement is right you can kind of get caught up in tough situations at times
5618067 there have been a number of times in his career where hes bet on himself on his confidence in what he can do
5618068 i dont like to talk about myself but i think ive done enough to earn where im at and that i have so much room to grow
5618069 im working on whats after this contract to continue to be a great player in this league i dont think you have to be a great shooter to be effective but you have to be a good shooter i work out every day trying to become a better shooter just like anybody else
5618070 if i improve every year i think ill be a shoo in if im also a winner the olympic team has guys who play well together they have some guys who have gone deep in the playoffs who have won a championship
5618071 i dont like iggy i dont mind the other a
5618072 it just shows the fans are watching basketball and know what i do i want to be dre thats it
5618073 i just have to be smart and handle myself like a professional at all times
5618074 if the doctors say he can go he says he can go and manager davey johnson says he can go he can go
5618075 time will tell but hes not a guy you write off
5618076 she wanted to win and she would run so hard that after some of her races she just practically would lay down for 3 or 4 days
5618077 she would run very very hard and give it all she had every time
5618078 he might be the best olympic athlete of all time
5618079 incredible you talk about tiger woods michael phelps and michael jordan hes part of that class where they dominate the sport
5618080 then she decided to get fit and change her speed
5618081 she needed that quick burst of speed every time both early in the game and late in the game she completely changed her fitness level
5618082 she has been one of the most important players on this team
5618083 i see it as a collective effort what weve been able to take from abbys injury is that it isnt just one person
5618084 if brazil is going to focus on me its not going to matter
5618085 it was great playing with them but lets face it
5618086 we talked about it for a long time we looked at every statistic that we kept from pass completions yards per catch yards after catch interceptions percentage of drives scoring good practices and bad practices we even consulted with some of the players
5618087 really when you look at all the data jordan steffy has earned the spot he was ahead in almost every category
5618088 sorry id love to go but i have to work that night
5618089 monotony is the poison of spirit ive had an overdose and im seeking the antidote
5618090 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5618091 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time
5618092 next i started thinking about the original plan of pitching the 2nd half of next season thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things
5618093 if a referee is going to make a judgment ok but it doesnt make any sense that everyone would come over spend all that time looking at a tape that provides incontrovertible visual evidence that a butt caused the damage and then the decision is to allow the referees first incorrect ruling to stand
5618094 the first concern should always be to get the call right
5618095 a saga of bad or poor judgment dereliction of duty total lack of governance greed breach of rules and law gross negligence and possibly criminal acts cascading down from the very top of aibas former administration
5618096 i opened it up right when i got on the plane and i finished it up right when we were rolling up to the stadium
5618097 i was must sitting around flipping pages man and i didnt get the proper warmup in ive got to remind myself sometimes that im not 21 its feeling a lot better now
5618098 pits the legendary profiler now retired from law enforcement and working as a psychiatrist in private practice against two serial killers kyle craig cross former colleague in the fbi who was revealed to be the mastermind a particularly vicious and resourceful murderer in 2001s violets are blue has managed to escape from a colorado maximum security prison and is steadily working his way through his list of those he holds responsible for his capture and incarceration cross who heads the list is drawn back into police work by his love interest maryland homicide detective brianna stone whos been assigned to the task force focusing on the d c audience killer or dcak who stages high profile and sadistic murders to get the most public attention possible
5618099 it was a good book i blame it on the book
5618100 i just didnt get up and walk around like im supposed to my back just kind of froze up on me a little bit
5618101 talk to him there he is right now in all his splendor
5618102 my hands slipped a couple times and i guess they saw me
5618103 and they didnt see that one i had a big target on my back
5618104 it is painful for him but the pain is not in his leg
5618105 four years after athens his main goal was beijing gold and he has done great work for it
5618106 todays result is not perfect especially for liu xiang there is great expectation and a great pressure from all for the past 4 years liu xiang has been an athlete with great stability who never drops out of competition easily
5618107 in watching warmups we could see he wasnt quite as strong as you expect him to be
5618108 but we didnt know it was as bad as it turned out to be
5618109 liu xiang is a great athlete he stands the pressure no other athletes can simply stand
5618110 we didnt realize it was so serious and that it would cause the problem of today
5618111 we didnt want to tell people he couldnt compete because we didnt know at the time
5618112 this deal is a testament to the booming realty industry in this region this collaborative approach with a committed long term partner will strengthen the development capabilities of the vaishnavi group and exert significant influence on the development of innovative projects
5618113 my copy of the schedule said that i dont work so i took a trip to colorado
5618114 tell that mick he just made my list of things to do today
5618115 you just dont do that at a club thats not fucking cool
5618116 but i have to fucking work at 5 30 how could you just leave me here by myself i have no way to get anywhere
5618117 i know i know but im not turning around sorry

5618125 when youre not in first you pay attention a little bit sooner than you would
5618126 weve already started weve got to take care of what were doing but were interested
5618127 when you look at it theres time but at the same time you dont want to get behind
5618128 at this time of the year if you get five or six games behind especially seven its not like you cant do it but odds are youve got to really play good and the team ahead of you kind of has to fold kind of has to go through a bad streak the thing about it right now id say at 38 games a team that can get a winning streak going or can get hot thats a team that can put a good push on claiming our division weve got to stay with them
5618129 you should let it affect you psychologically in a good way like last year
5618130 having to watch the mets last year we responded and played well hopefully at this point two games behind well do the same we watch what they do they keep on winning we know we have to keep on winning its unfortunate that we put ourselves in this position but thats the position we are in so were forced to see what they do
5618131 at this time of the year when you let it slip behind its harder to gain ground so this time of year yeah you pay more attention when you are behind
5618132 if god had a face what would it look like and would you wanna see if seeing meant that you would have to believe
5618133 hi im youve probably heard of my band metro station
5618134 i came to the birds nest to lay a golden egg and thats what i did
5618135 it can be an attribute because i have long arms
5618136 but im working on my strength those throws are going to get better from here
5618137 i have the levers maybe some day ill be the first recordholder who is clean
5618138 one year of your twenties is worth five in your thirties and worth ten in your forties and if you havent settled on what youre going to do by then you should just stop and enjoy it cause then its too late to change things
5618139 iguodala is a major and integral part of our team
5618140 he is not replaceable the way the league works and the collective bargaining agreement works this man was not replaceable iguodalas option was to play for the qualifying offer and then become an unrestricted free agent
5618141 we didnt want to even get to that we wanted to make a deal so that wed have him for the long term
5618142 we made a commitment to the city and to our fans that we were going for an nba championship when we signed elton brand
5618143 this to me was a deal that we had to get done along with reserve guard lou williams who signed a 5 year deal worth about 25 million
5618144 now we have a nucleus of players that we feel real good about we wanted iguodala in a 76er uniform we were going to make a deal with him and thats what we did
5618145 said liukin who on different days competed in the qualifiers the team competition the all around which she won and the floor exercise before yesterdays bars contest
5618146 i dont think a lot of people know whats going on right now
5618147 i believe its correct to have two gold medals three
5618148 im very disappointed in that consistently it was the same country i think this was a different judge i dont want to go any further with that want to go ask her no idea theres not a single gymnast in finals from there
5618149 i know they were both from australia i dont want to start anything im just kind of stating the facts
5618150 if it had happened in the all around i would have been more disappointed
5618151 the chinese girl did an excellent routine and the girl who got third i thought got a little underscored its unfair to her
5618152 im hoping to get that gold i feel i missed out on today
5618153 gus durs was a personal expression of views by a former president of indonesia whose stand and reputation we in malaysia are aware of
5618154 beautifully realised temples in thailand replete with moving foliage and incredibly detailed environmental effects and lighting
5618155 at this point we have no relationship and i dont see that changing
5618156 its just gotten to a point where i think lines were crossed if you ask me coaches should be coaches management should be management and i dont think those lines should be crossed but when you cross those lines you put yourself in position for things like this to happen
5618157 every time we give him opportunities he seems to make plays
5618158 hes one of those guys who doesnt look great when you go to individual drills but he just finds ways to make plays

5618167 think 500 000 products and millions of skus or something close to that wed probably have to scrap subsonic but the more i work with it the less i like it its a good tool for prototyping and getting things done quickly but when you look to scale like this my thinking is that it wont hold up
5618168 oh his project is suuuuch a biitch just look at the way he wrote that test
5618169 ive read about headphones causing pressure on the eardrums but i cant live without my music
5618170 it depends on my surroundings if i were at home it wouldnt be
5618171 ive read about headphones causing pressure on the eardrums but i cant live without my music
5618172 at the end of the day all that matters is the length of time exposed to a certain level of volume
5618173 the general rule of thumb is if youre done with something and theres ringing in the ears youve done some damage and it accumulates over time once youve done that damage youre susceptible to even more damage
5618174 there will be nights where ill fall asleep with my ipod on

5618184 faced with the embarrassing prospect of holding a fundraiser with one of s closest associates the mccain campaign scrambled today to scratch ralph reed from tonights program but voters deserve to know the answers to the real questions raised by reeds involvement
5618185 first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5618186 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5618187 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5618188 it is extremely positive that the libyan ambassador was personally on board to monitor the exercises we look forward to full participation by libya in multilateral search and rescue patrols in the mediterranean in the near future
5618189 the participation of libya in joint patrols in the mediterranean sea is absolutely necessary if we want to defeat the human traffickers who are operating in this area whilst saving human lives
5618190 the process went smoothly it was mediated by the french ambassador
5618191 we waited for georgias agreement to carry out the swap for 24 hours and we received it not long ago
5618192 voor wat betreft de ideale vertrek en terugkeerdata tijdens allerheiligen is alles volzet
5618193 de terugtrekking van de russische troepen is van start gegaan maar men zal wel enkele dagen moeten wachten alvorens het zespuntenplan kan gerealiseerd worden
5618194 de volledige terugtrekking hangt af van het beleid van de georgische president mikhail saakasjvili en de acties van zijn troepen wij willen deze nachtmerrie zo snel mogelijk be indigen
5618195 ik had al pijn tijdens de warming up het was echt onmogelijk om de race te voltooien
5618196 ik wil mijn excuses aanbieden aan alle supporters ik vind het heel erg vervelend maar ben dankbaar voor alle steun die ik van iedereen heb ontvangen
5618197 de pijn was op dat moment echt ondraaglijk als ik de wedstrijd had uitgelopen liep ik het risico mijn achillespees onherstelbaar te beschadigen ik kan het gevoel dat op dat moment door me heen ging onmogelijk beschrijven
5618198 nu moet ik al mijn energie richten op het herstel van mijn blessure volgend jaar moet het dan op het wk maar gebeuren ik geef niet zo makkelijk op
5618199 we snappen allemaal dat een blessure liu dwong de race te verlaten we hopen nu dat hij snel hertelt zodat hij nog harder kan strijden voor de eer van het land
5618200 why you know you guys could go just a few minutes without each other sometimes

5618205 less restrictive monetary conditions could soon be called for otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase
5618206 they have no knowledge who carry about their wooden idols and keep on praying to a god that cannot save let them take counsel together
5618207 moses gave you circumcision not that it is from moses but from the fathers and you circumcise a man on the sabbath
5618208 just so i tell you there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety nine righteous persons who need no repentance
5618209 already you have all you want already you have become rich without us you have become kings and would that you did reign so that we might share the rule with you
5618210 15 and when he had come to the king the king said to him
5618211 men are perishing and if it be unpolite to tell them so it can only be so where the devil is the master of the ceremonies out upon your soul destroying politeness the lord give us a little honest love to souls and this superficial gentility will soon vanish i could with considerable refreshment to myself pour sarcasm after sarcasm upon religious cowardice i would cheerfully sharpen my knife and dash it into the heart of this mean vice there is nothing to be said in its favor it is not even humble it is only pride of too beggarly a sort to own itself

5618243 we were told hed been missing for a little bit and the family had been looking for him
5618244 they cleared the swimming area by forming a human chain to search
5618245 at one point he disappeared in the water and it appears the brother waited a little while before telling the family he was missing
5618246 upon notification of a child missing in the water the park staff immediately cleared the water and started searching both the ground and water area
5618247 our thoughts and prayers are with the family with regard to this unfortunate incident and the park intends to fully cooperate with all local authorities

5618258 if the europeans let russia away with this what guarantee can they then give poland or the baltic states if the scenario repeats itself
5618259 the penalty for russia should be its withdrawal from georgia and the assurance that it will make no similar new attempt
5618260 it was a difficult decision for them but now they have left to see how things are in basra
5618261 but they were also troubled by the attention their case had generated
5618262 whether we humans are smart enough to build such machines is a different question maybe were just not smart enough that pisses off the scientists when i say that

5618283 i looked back at my 27 years as a head coach at kent roosevelt and i knew i had to take this opportunity
5618284 at my age im running out of chances and i didnt know if id ever get another try at being a head coach
5618285 only one year after making its first ever state playoff appearance with a 10 0 mark
5618286 four years ago ed becker looked at me and i told him that we needed to change our offensive style
5618287 ive studied the offenses from other area coaches to develop a system that better matched our personnel
5618288 the last time i was a head coach we always did things under center
5618289 we did some run and shoot things before but being primarily in the shotgun is a totally different thing
5618290 a rarity in the area and something nemec says means the world to todays young athlete
5618291 a big difference from when i was first coach is that i think kids these days dont necessarily have the same support system they used to
5618292 i think its wonderful to have an administration that understands having coaches around 24 7 means we can help form the support system these kids need to grow
5618293 since ive been back the people who were happy for me called and those who werent have yet to respond
5618294 seriously though weve had great success and great kids here at kent and i hope i can duplicate things im really excited about what we can all do together
5618295 im excited to be releasing news about recent internet gambling free zones item developments
5618296 and we believe this new institution of higher learning will have a great impact
5618297 dont get left out in the cold when it comes to internet gambling free zones technology
5618298 get good deals and second hand hardware when you can
5618299 but whatever you do get one of these internet gambling free zones products while supplies last
5618300 im thrilled to be one of the only stores to carry this internet gambling free zones book release
5618301 im excited to be releasing news about recent internet gambling free zones item developments
5618302 are ones that are very short and synonymous with internet gambling free zones industry terms
5618303 the constant changes and stages an organization must go through to seek after greatness
5618304 it isnt the changes that do you in its the transitions change is situational the new site the new boss the new team roles and the new policy transition is the psychological process people go through to come to terms with the new situation change is external transition is internal
5618305 the greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short but in setting our aim too low and achieving our mark
5618306 the screening for hla b 5701 prior to abacavir treatment allows the identification of patients likely to develop hsr using hla b 5701 tests as a companion diagnostic with the drug abacavir therefore helps to better protect hiv infected patients in treatment from severe additional suffering
5618307 the combination of diagnostics and therapeutics is a key approach to eliminating risks of side effects and therefore increasing the efficacy of drugs
5618308 carbamazepine for instance which is prescribed for treatment of epilepsy is more likely to cause dangerous or even fatal skin reaction in asian patients carrying the hla b 1502 allele
5618309 our new test is another great example for the advent of molecular diagnostic tests which can be used to assess the efficacy of drugs this trend holds great promises for the future enabling doctors to customize therapies based on molecular tests which create molecular profiles of patients or diseases ultimately leads to more medical innovation cost efficiency and most importantly to better and safer treatment of patients
5618310 so far we have only seen the tip of the pharmacogenomic and companion diagnostic icebergs at qiagen we are proud of the roles that our sample and assay technologies and molecular diagnostics franchise contribute to bringing the vision of personalized medicine to reality

5618312 das screening auf hla b 5701 vor der behandlung mit abacavir erm glicht die identifizierung von patienten die wahrscheinlich eine berempfindlichkeitsreaktion zeigen werden durch die gemeinsame nutzung des hla b 5701 tests in verbund mit dem wirkstoff abacavir k nnen patienten mit einer hiv infektion somit besser vor zus tzlichen leiden gesch tzt werden
5618313 die kombination von diagnostika und therapeutika ist der schl ssel zur vermeidung des risikos auf nebenwirkungen und somit zur erh hung der wirksamkeit von medikamenten
5618314 ein beispiel ist das medikament carbamazepine welches zur behandlung von epilepsie eingesetzt wird und bei patienten asiatischer abstammung mit dem hla b 1502 allel zu gef hrlichen oder sogar potenziell t dlichen berempfindlichkeitsreaktionen der haut f hren kann
5618315 unser neuer test ist ein weiteres exzellentes beispiel f r die verbreitung molekulardiagnostischer testverfahren die zur beurteilung der wirksamkeit von medikamenten eingesetzt werden k nnen diese entwicklung verspricht zuk nftig enorme vorteile wenn rzte in die lage versetzt werden mithilfe molekularer testverfahren ihre behandlungsstrategien auf basis der molekularen profile von patienten und erkrankungen individuell anzupassen f hrt dies zu mehr medizinischen innovationen einer h heren kosteneffizienz und vor allem zu besseren und sichereren versorgung der patienten
5618316 wenn es um pharmakogenomik und begleitdiagnostik geht haben wir bislang nur die spitze des eisbergs gesehen wir bei qiagen sind stolz auf den beitrag den unsere probenvorbereitungs und testtechnologien sowie unsere kompetenz im bereich der molekularen diagnostik zur verwirklichung der vision einer personalisierten medizin leisten

5618326 maha suci allah maha suci allah maha suci allah sesungguhnya aku tiada daya usaha melainkan melainkan allah lah pelindungku tuhan yang maha tinggi lagi maha agung
5618327 hai dahri apalah yang digusarkan orang yang mengetahuinya pasti menjawabnya
5618328 siapa kamu hai anak muda berani sungguh menyahut cabaranku sedangkan ulama yang hebat hebat yang berserban dan berjubah labuh telah ku kalahkan
5618329 sesungguhnya allah tidak mengurniakan kemuliaan dan kebesaran itu pada serban atau jubah yang labuh tetapi allah mengurniakan kemuliaan kepada orang orang yang berilmu dan bertakwa
5618330 hairan kau kata allah itu wujud tetapi tidak bertempat pula
5618331 ah itu senang sahaja wahai dahri cuba kau lihat pada dirimu sendiri bukankah pada dirimu itu ada nyawa
5618332 bahkan memang aku ada nyawa dan memang setiap makhluk yang bernafas itu ada nyawa
5618333 tetapi adakah kau tahu di manakah letaknya nyawa atau rohmu itu dikepalakah diperutkah atau adakah dihujung tapak kakimu
5618334 kalau begitu di manakah lemak itu berada di bahagian atasnya atau di bawahkah
5618335 untuk mencari di manakah roh dalam jasad dan di manakah kandungan lemak dalam susu ini pun kita tidak upaya masakan pula kita dapat menjangkau di manakah beradanya zat allah s w t di alam maya ini zat yang mencipta dan mentadbir seluruh alam ini termasuk roh dan akal dangkal kita ini pun ciptaan nya yang tunduk dan patuh di bawah urusan tadbir kerajaan nya yang maha agung
5618336 wahai dahri tidak ada suatu pun yang wujud sebelum allah s w t dan tidak ada sesuatu jua yang akan muncul selepas nya allah tetap qadim dan azali dialah yang awal dan dialah yang akhir
5618337 pelik sungguh mana mungkin begitu tuhan wujud tanpa ada permulaannya dan mana mungkin dia pula yang terakhir tanpa ada lagi yang selepas nya
5618338 ya dalilnya ada pada diri kamu sendiri cuba kau lihat pada ibu jari mu itu jari apakah yang kau nampak berada sebelum jari ini
5618339 dan pada jari manis kau itu ada lagikah jari yang selepasnya
5618340 jadi kalaulah pada jari kita yang kecil ini pun tidak mampu kita fikir apatah lagi allah zat yang maha agung itu yang tiada suatu pun yang mendahului nya dan tiada sesuatu yang kemudian selepas nya
5618341 allah itu ada kata mu ha apakah pekerjaan tuhanmu ketika ini
5618342 ini soalan yang sungguh menarik jadi kenalah dijawab dari tempat yang tinggi supaya dapat didengar oleh semua orang
5618343 wahai sekelian manusia ketahuilah bahawa kerja allah ketika ini ialah menggugurkan yang batil sebagaimana dahri yang berada di atas mimbar diturunkan allah ke bawah mimbar dan allah juga telah menaikkan yang hak sebagaimana aku yang berada di sana telah dinaikkan ke atas mimbar masjid jamek ini

5618371 we were looking for someone with a strong coaching and administrative background and identified neale as the best person for this role
5618372 as a player and a coach he was a high achiever and has also been successful in the last 12 months as chief executive of the afl coaches association
5618373 he is a man of impeccable character someone who will add great value to our football club as we begin our resurgence as a powerful on field force in the afl
5618374 its an exciting challenge and a great time to begin with the west coast eagles

5618376 the club has a terrific young list and i look forward to playing my role in assisting the clubs climb back up the afl ladder
5618377 i have been very impressed in the conversations i have had with neale over the past couple of months
5618378 he brings to the table exactly the attributes we were looking for and believe he will assist us greatly in our vision for the team

5618399 we have heard about suicide bombers on foot they are receiving indirect fire
5618400 our commando units were deployed into the area and engaged the attackers and pushed them back
5618401 so far 13 attackers have been killed six blew themselves up six others died in the explosions and one died in gunfire from commandos their bodies have been recovered
5618402 thirteen suicide bombers were killed in kijran area of ali sher district

5618405 we are coming here to submit a letter to the british government asking them to return thaksin to receive justice in thailand
5618406 thaksin fled the indictment to london and is planning to seek asylum in britain
5618407 if thaksin is not brought back to face the charges against him in thai courts it will further contribute to the political and democratic deadlock
5618408 extradition requests are decided in strict accordance with the law
5618409 thaksin is not a political refugee but a criminal evading an arrest warrant

5618417 we will do whatever is necessary and no one should have any illusion
5618418 nobody is planning to withdraw the russian contingent very swiftly as there is no such necessity
5618419 when a man steals your wife there is no better revenge than to let him keep her

5618422 it was a perfect marriage she didnt want to and he couldnt
5618423 my advice to you is get married if you find a good wife youll be happy if not youll become a philosopher
5618424 the general was essentially a man of peace except of course in his domestic affairs
5618425 i was married by a judge i should have asked for a jury
5618426 perfect love is rare indeed for to be a lover will require that you continually have the subtlety of the very wise the flexibility of the child the sensitivity of the artist the understanding of the philosopher the acceptance of the saint the tolerance of the scholar and the fortitude of the certain

5618438 but blandina was suspended on a stake and exposed to be devoured by the wild beasts who should attack her and because she appeared as if hanging on a cross and because of her earnest prayers she inspired the combatants with great zeal for they looked on her in her conflict and beheld with their outward eyes in the form of their sister him who was crucified for them that he might persuade those who believe on him that every one who suffers for the glory of christ has fellowship always with the living god as none of the wild beasts at that time touched her she was taken down from the stake and cast again into prison she was preserved thus for another contest that being victorious in more conflicts she might make the punishment of the crooked serpent irrevocable 38 and though small and weak and despised yet clothed with christ the mighty and conquering athlete she might arouse the zeal of the brethren and having overcome the adversary many times might receive through her conflict the crown incorruptible but attalus was called for loudly by the people because he was a person of distinction he entered the contest readily on account of a good conscience and his genuine practice in christian discipline and as he had always been a witness for the truth among us he was led around the amphitheater a tablet being carried before him on which was written in the roman language this is attalus the christian and the people were filled with indignation against him but when the governor learned that he was a roman he commanded him to be taken back with the rest of those who were in prison concerning whom he had written to caesar and whose answer he was awaiting the emperor orders that all of the prisoner be examined yet again and that any who deny christ be set free those who refuse to apostatize will be beaten to death therefore at the beginning of the public festival which took place there and which was attended by crowds of men from all nations the governor brought the blessed ones to the judgment seat to make of them a show and spectacle for the multitude wherefore also he examined them again and beheaded those who appeared to possess roman citizenship but he sent the others to the wild beasts and christ was glorified greatly in those who had formerly denied him for contrary to the expectation of the heathen they confessed for they were examined by themselves as about to be set free but confessing they were added to the order of the witnesses but some continued without who had never possessed a trace of faith nor any apprehension of the wedding garmentnor an understanding of the fear of god but as sons of perdition they blasphemed the way through their apostasy but all the others were added to the church while these were being examined a certain alexander a phrygian by birth and physician by profession who had resided in gaul for many years and was well known to all on account of his love to god and boldness of speech for he was not without a share of apostolic grace standing before the judgment seat and by signs encouraging them to confess appeared to those standing by as if in travail but the people being enraged because those who formerly denied now confessed cried out against alexander as if he were the cause of this then the governor summoned him and inquired who he was and when he answered that he was a christian being very angry he condemned him to the wild beasts and on the next day he entered along with attalus for to please the people the governor had ordered attalus again to the wild beasts and they were tortured in the amphitheater with all the instruments contrived for that purpose and having endured a very great conflict were at last sacrificed alexander neither groaned nor murmured in any manner but communed in his heart with god but when attalus was placed in the iron seat and the fumes arose from his burning body he said to the people in the roman language lo this which ye do is devouring men but we do not devour men nor do any other wicked thing and being asked what name god has he replied god has not a name as man has after all these on the last day of the contests blandina was again brought in with ponticus a boy about fifteen years old they had been brought every day to witness the sufferings of the others and had been pressed to swear by the idols but because they remained steadfast and despised them the multitude became furious so that they had no compassion for the youth of the boy nor respect for the sex of the woman therefore they exposed them to all the terrible sufferings and took them through the entire round of torture repeatedly urging them to swear but being unable to effect this for ponticus encouraged by his sister so that even the heathen could see that she was confirming and strengthening him having nobly endured every torture gave up the ghost but the blessed blandina last of all having as a noble mother encouraged her children and sent them before her victorious to the king endured herself all their conflicts and hastened after them glad and rejoicing in her departure as if called to a marriage supper rather than cast to wild beasts and after the scourging after the wild beasts after the roasting seat she was finally enclosed in a net and thrown before a bull and having been tossed about by the animal but feeling none of the things which were happening to her on account of her hope and firm hold upon what had been entrusted to her and her communion with christ she also was sacrificed and the heathen themselves confessed that never among them had a woman endured so many and such terrible tortures but not even thus was their madness and cruelty toward the saints satisfied for incited by the wild beast wild and barbarous tribes were not easily appeased and their violence found another peculiar opportunity in the dead bodies for through their lack of manly reason the fact that they had been conquered did not put them to shame but rather the more enkindled their wrath as that of a wild beast and aroused alike the hatred of governor and people to treat us unjustly that the scripture might be fulfilled he that is lawless let him be lawless still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still for they cast to the dogs those who had died of suffocation in the prison carefully guarding them by night and day lest any one should be buried by us and they exposed the remains left by the wild beasts and by fire mangled and charred and placed the heads of the others by their bodies and guarded them in like manner from burial by a watch of soldiers for many days and some raged and gnashed their teeth against them desiring to execute more severe vengeance upon them but others laughed and mocked at them magnifying their own idols and imputed to them the punishment of the christians even the more reasonable and those who had seemed to sympathize somewhat reproached them often saying where is their god and what has their religion which they have chosen rather than life profited them so various was their conduct toward us but we were in deep affliction because we could not bury the bodies for neither did night avail us for this purpose nor did money persuade nor entreaty move to compassion but they kept watch in every way as if the prevention of the burial would be of some great advantage to them

5618442 i would tell you that its a different way of building applications my prediction would be that web 3 0 will ultimately be seen as applications which are pieced together there are a number of characteristics the applications are relatively small the data is in the cloud the applications can run on any device pc or mobile phone the applications are very fast and theyre very customizable furthermore the applications are distributed virally literally by social networks by email you wont go to the store and purchase them thats a very different application model than weve ever seen in computing
5618443 web 1 0 was dial up 50k average bandwidth web 2 0 is an average 1 megabit of bandwidth and web 3 0 will be 10 megabits of bandwidth all the time which will be the full video web and that will feel like web 3 0

5618453 the biggest mistake business partners make is jumping into business before really getting to know each other
5618454 you must be able to connect in order to feel comfortable expressing your opinions ideas and expectations
5618455 any partnership that operates without a written agreement is simply playing russian roulette
5618456 if they cant get through the agreement in my office there is no way they will realistically launch a business
5618457 both parties should agree upon a cpa they trust the methodology the cpa might employ and how to value certain interests

5618479 as i suspected the mixture of three parts manganese and two parts bisulphate of barysta produces a compound that is quite potent if used as a sedative
5618480 in the past three weeks alone i have noted no fewer than four state visits from varying royal families across europe each parading as many expensive jewels as they are hoarding official documents and treaties yet my attention has not been drawn to any significant cases in the past month save perhaps the rather trifling affair concerning the duke of northumberlands missing cygnet were i a criminal watson i daresay that i would be the craftiest and hardest working in my profession
5618481 it is perhaps fortunate then holmes that you are not a criminal
5618482 you might prove so successful in your alternative profession that you would be forced to revert to your true one in a bid to catch yourself
5618483 i daresay that our guest is here on rather more personable business than our last friend from the dark continent although he has experienced a childhood of slavery i note that our guest is of noble stock in his homeland pray king jaja wont you sit down
5618484 there are several of your esteemed peers who have turned me away at the door at the mere sight of my countenance i must warn you however that my business here is of a very sensitive nature and i would much prefer if i had the opportunity to speak with you in private
5618485 dr watson is my personal physician and long time chronicler i can assure you that his discretion is of the utmost eminence and that you may speak as freely before him as before myself
5618486 very well then i know of your reputation mr holmes and that you are a fair and just man as an englishman some of the revelations i make may sit uncomfortably with you nevertheless my presence here is not so much to enlist your aid than to bear witness to the questionable actions of some of your fellow kinsmen
5618487 i have had occasion to deal with some very poor specimens of the human race irrespective of their nationality i can assure you that i will be unfazed by anything you may have to say pray continue
5618488 it would be best perhaps if i were to start at the very beginning
5618489 in my experience there is often no better place to start
5618490 i hail from amaigbo in igboland i was sold as a slave at the age of twelve and was given the name jubo jubogha i was fortunate enough to learn english to a high degree and began using this to my advantage i soon managed to pay my way out of slavery and gained a reputation noteworthy enough to allow me become the head of the anna pepple house in the bonny creek after the incumbent passed away our people can be a discordant race mr holmes almost from the start of my reign there was conflict particularly from a rival chief oko jumbo who headed the manilla pepple house it is sad that this internal strife forced me to break away from the house and set up an independent city state by a river formerly called ekomtoro in andoni country i have since renamed the town opobo
5618491 you must be aware that oil palm oil is enjoying a roaring trade in the bonny hinterland this past decade or so many of the rival chiefs have been forced to deal with the europeans who live in the coast however over the years i have built strong contacts with the british to such an extent that i am now the principal exporter of palm oil directly to liverpool in fact it is a meeting with hatton amp cookson one of my primary contacts that brings me to england
5618492 they say the atlantic slave trade is dead yet many pf our finest sons still go missing most of the chiefs have become so powerless that they cannot even mobilise enough men to search fro them in any case it is easier to just lay the blame of these kidnappings at your neighbours feet and start a civil war of late the favourite british pastime has been to wave a piece of paper under the nose of our kings in exchange for free trade they are forcing them to abdicate their thrones of course half of these kings cannot read the documents in front of them and are being wilfully deceived they call this piece of paper the protectorate treaty but who or what is being protected i have refused to sign the document as it is tantamount to a warrant that will make us serfs on our own land i have been threatened with bombardment and force mr holmes my crime it seems has been to restrict fair trade which takes precedence over free trade never mind the fact that i have created jobs all across the opobo river and beyond i have paid all my predecessors debts to the europeans and have never resorted to violence despite provocation on several occasions i fear that my days are numbered my oracle has already warned of this however our fight for free trade will continue long after i am dead the british cannot lay claim to a land that our forefathers toiled so long and hard for i will no sit idly by mr holmes i cannot
5618493 your narrative is most revealing however i must confess at being at a complete loss as to how i may be of any assistance to you i am neither a government official nor in the direct employ of her majesty
5618494 quite right mr holmes as i said at the start i have approached several individuals of repute including members of parliament and commons in an effort to state my case until now not one person has so much as opened the door to me i have grown tired of writing letters without so much as the grace of an acknowledgement no mr holmes you cannot help me but you have kindly given me your ear this past half hour there are good men here in england who i know will continue to fight the cause of an oppressed people i am confident that you and dr watson have been greater enlightened by some of the events transpiring in africa
5618495 i am in great profit for your visit this evening
5618496 there goes watson as noble a gentleman as any royal i have ever met on the subject of empire you know that i am a most ardent devotee yet i fear that the sophistication of those that we call savages on these lands is advancing at such a rate that one begins to question our continued interference invasion is only an attractive option where one has a clear and prescribed exit strategy i fear that there are dark and bloody days ahead and we may yet rue the incessant expansion of the great british empire
5618497 i have skulked indoors for far too long and i am in need of some mental invigoration there is a rendition of chopins second opus at the lyceum and if we catch a hansom we may yet be in time for the third act
5618498 if i were ever going to be a law breaker this would be the one

5618505 i just dont understand it its a never ending battle to find somewhere to ride

5618507 keluarga kami sudah jenuh dengan pengakuan pengakuan seseorang yang bernama supriyadi karena kami telah meyakini bahwa supriyadi telah meninggal dunia meskipun jasad maupun kuburannya belum ditemukan

5618510 they the mayor and the d a have gone too far when they blame these two fine young lawyers as being part of the problem they are part of the solution

5618513 the estate of danieal kelly by and through the administrators of the estate daniel kelly and andrea kelly
5618514 if theres a manner of obtaining for them compensation some benefits to make their lives a little bit better to help get them some schooling some education a decent home then it is incumbent upon any lawyer to attempt to get that for them
5618515 how are we going to get those children compensation it doesnt happen automatically if some lawyer doesnt step forward and bring the action that benefits these children it doesnt happen

5618522 after carefully reading the inspector generals report i have decided to follow the recommendation of the inspector general and discipline both pamela mayo and wesley brown
5618523 actions or inactions of these supervisors might arguably be considered criminal
5618524 a share of the stain of responsibility for danieals death remains on their hands

5618530 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah

5618532 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
5618533 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
5618534 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
5618535 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
5618536 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
5618537 we think those sprinklers would have contained the fire so that the fire department might have been able to control it and save those buildings

5618557 finding statistically robust associations linked to two proteins that may be involved in regulating such ion channels and that are also thought to be targets of drugs used to clinically to treat bipolar disorder is astonishing
5618558 faced with little agreement among previous studies searching for the genomic hot spots in bipolar disorder these researchers pooled their data for maximal statistical power and unearthed surprising results
5618559 improved understanding of these abnormalities could lead to new hope for the millions of americans affected by bipolar disorder

5618566 there were periods when i wished i was able to tell people about my condition
5618567 but now even at the age of 29 i dont want to go out on the streets without my make up
5618568 there are millions of people who do wear make up each day for different reasons and i am just one of them but i dont feel i could go out without my vitiligo covered up which sounds pretty sad
5618569 but it is just the way it is for me
5618570 wearing no make up for the ads was good i had been in front of strangers without make up for a short time but with the video a much wider range of people have seen it
5618571 of course my family have seen me before without make up as has my boyfriend and some very close friends
5618572 but even people i work with havent so doing the advert was a big deal for me
5618573 as a child of four i have to admit that i was blissfully unaware of any difference between other children and myself
5618574 i never experienced any animosity cruelty or name calling and for that i must be eternally grateful as not everyone is so fortunate
5618575 it is only when you are a teenager and start staying over at other girls houses that it becomes a bit of a pain having to put the make up on and take it off and i did not feel comfortable telling people who were not in my family
5618576 and when you are a teenager it is all about how you look
5618577 the colour match was so perfect that it meant i didnt have to tell anybody unless i wanted to
5618578 however by not being honest with people other than my family i still was not accepting the fact that this was likely to be with me for the rest of my life and i still had never asked myself if this was something i could cope with forever
5618579 teenagers and people in their early 20s are the most susceptible to psychological and emotional trauma experienced at the onset of the condition
5618580 people with vitiligo dont tend to go swimming or wear a summer dress because of the taboos associated with the skin and because of our obsession with a perfect body and especially the skin
5618581 where we are now why were here what we suspect
5618582 i see no reason why this baby should not have tubes so hes going to get them and i think well do it next thursday

5618621 he was basically very badly injured which caused him to have to take medication that morning he was distraught related to the whole lawsuit pending to the car injury situation it really made him very very upset and that kind of set him off is my guess
5618622 until we have more we dont know whether or not theres a crime involved
5618623 were waiting for the coroner to tell us whether he was medicated or not
5618624 it can take up to three to six weeks to determine manner and cause of death
5618625 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5618626 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5618627 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5618628 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5618629 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5618630 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5618631 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5618632 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5618633 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5618634 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5618635 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5618636 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5618637 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5618638 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice

5618641 if thats what hes saying then i suspect that he was looking for an excuse
5618642 i think it speaks volumes if they are not prepared to come and be accountable to forum leaders
5618643 very disappointing that he wont turn up to effectively take his medicine
5618644 i will be compelled to tell the people of my country that they must now be prepared to suffer more sanctions and international isolation as we pursue a better more durable democracy
5618645 your looks will fade and my money will likely continue into perpetuity in fact it is very likely that my income increases but it is an absolute certainty that you wont be getting any more beautiful
5618646 so in economic terms you are a depreciating asset and i am an earning asset
5618647 let me explain youre 25 now and will likely stay pretty hot for the next 5 years but less so each year then the fade begins in earnest by 35 stick a fork in you

5618650 i love the fraternity brothers because theyre so young and such a contrasting team
5618651 one takes his time to think things out the other one loves to rush and go at a million miles an hour theres definitely tension between the two of them while theyre making decisions during the race
5618652 they are small we wanted to make sure that there wasnt anything to prevent us from putting that pack underneath the seat in front of us when we got on a plane we didnt want something to happen where we got delayed because of our luggage we thought that would help us go faster
5618653 we did extensive research on what to wear what was lightweight and would help us move the fastest
5618654 i think it was the longest i ever went without wearing a logo on my t shirt
5618655 we both tried to do some training along the lines of going down to our little gym but that was pretty much it
5618656 we have an emerging farm so we do a lot of work out there splitting wood and taking care of the horses
5618657 people were a little afraid we were going to pull a borat on them i told them we werent doing borat but what happened there is very very funny its not easy to shoot in places like that because they practically have no television industry
5618658 the teams have no idea how to get from point a to point b there
5618659 they dont know the language its very difficult to get through this country they get so stuck but they find so many fascinating solutions of how to get through everything one of the things the teams do there is go to a real life floating village its insane

5618663 they were left with some financial debt so they really have a motive to run around the world

5618673 i know that ill have to break my own record to make the final but i think that i am doing everything right and my confidence is sky high
5618674 i got this one right my mind is buzzing right now but i have to keep it under control
5618675 ill be getting a lane in the midddle for the semi final getting to mix it with the big boys and i feel that im ready
5618676 it was a big achievement for me to beat spearmon and that also helps my confidence
5618677 weve abandoned racing for today following 11mm of overnight rain
5618678 there has also been continuing rain this morning which started up again at around 8am
5618679 we will also hold an inspection at 4pm for racing for the rest of the week
5618680 we are looking at the feasibility with the british horseracing authority and other parties at staging todays group races later this week
5618681 we can feel its euro 2008 still in their mind and that they cant wait for the competition and the qualifying campaign to start
5618682 those things leave traces there are so many qualities within the team that this failure can hardly be understood
5618683 after a bad competition we are always expecting the next game to show it was just an accident
5618684 the new generation is coming and mixed with the experienced ones i believe we can do something good
5618685 he cant be captain of the team on the bench i pick over what ive seen over the last two or three weeks and weve lifted the standard
5618686 now i look on the bench and i see dean sitting there along with carlos edwards michael chopra and anthony stokes thats a good sign of the progress weve made as a club
5618687 als ik weer de studio induik zal het wel een ander muzikaal genre worden
5618688 in ieder geval in het engels en iets puurder een beetje in de stijl van duffy en amy winehouse
5618689 ik snap dat wel ze zien mij niet als zangeres ik vind het ook moeilijk om mijzelf als zodanig te betitelen
5618690 een wereldzangeres ben ik niet maar ik kan een liedje wel vol overtuiging brengen
5618691 there is much pleasure to be gained from useless knowledge
5618692 it just feels fantastic to come in with a medal this time and the fact that its gold is just amazing
5618693 i always knew it was going to be a bit of an up and down regatta i didnt start great in the first race but bounced straight back and then from there i was always within reaching distance and sailed a superb day yesterday to give myself the cushion i needed for today
5618694 i think that if the winds here had been a little bit stronger and the racing had been normal then i would have just sailed my race because i would have been more confident that i wasnt going to lose
5618695 but because the wind was so light and so random the only way to guarantee winning was to do what i did
5618696 my heart feels for him i feel sorry for him but at the end of the day you have to do whats best for you
5618697 maybe tomorrow i might be happy im in the final but right now im still a bit mad with myself the 28 year old said
5618698 i always make hard work of it when have i ever had an easy ride never once i just accept that im never going to have an easy ride ill be fine
5618699 i was hoping not to need two throws because there were so many people in the pool but i had a bit of food poisoning last week at our training camp in macau and nerves mixed with food poisoning in an olympic qualifying round doesnt make for very good stomach cramps
5618700 i was struggling a bit and it wasnt a great first round but im pleased to be through
5618701 ik ben opgegroeid in deze stad ik kwam vroeger altijd al in deze bioscoop en dan eerst een frietje halen bij de macdonalds dat kwam nu helaas even niet uit
5618702 we zijn van plan heel veel naar nederland te vliegen ik kan geen afscheid nemen van ons huis in laren daarom zullen we er ook verblijven als we in het land zijn
5618703 het gaat mij er niet om hoeveel mensen mij zien maar om wat voor rollen ik speel het is niet mijn doel de bekendste nederlander te worden
5618704 net als mijn ouders en mijn twee jongere broertjes of ik hier ooit zou vertrekken nou ja het is niet ondenkbaar stel dat ik verliefd zou worden op een vrouw die niet kan verhuizen voor haar werk of zo maar ik zal haar dan toch eerst naar den haag proberen te lokken haha
5618705 de tweeling die ik speel is inderdaad een dubbelrol de broers kennen elkaar niet het aardige is dat ze totaal verschillende karakters hebben de een is een hagenaar de ander is een hagenees ja dat is een duidelijk verschil pauwen en reigers slaat daar ook op hagenaren de pauwen zijn zeg maar mensen die het wat ruimer hebben hagenezen reigers hebben wat minder te besteden ik vind dat ik er zelf een beetje tussenin zit maar ik ben in het huis van hagenezen geboren
5618706 we hadden het niet arm thuis maar we woonden zeker niet in een villa mijn ouders moesten gewoon hard werken om hun drie zoons naar school te kunnen sturen weet je ik ben er trots op dat ik in den haag woon veel mensen verhuizen naar bijvoorbeeld amsterdam omdat dat makkelijker is ik heb mijn vrienden familie voetbalclub en het strand nooit willen achterlaten nu komt het een keer in mijn voordeel uit want ik kan straks voor het eerst op de fiets naar mijn werk
5618707 ik heb nog geen ervaring met presenteren ik heb nu een paar opnamedagen achter de rug en het is moeilijker dan ik van tevoren had gedacht ik mag geen fouten maken alles moet in n keer goed gaan
5618708 als we elkaar even zat zijn zeggen we gewoon he ga jij eens naar het bijhuis
5618709 doordat ik zwanger was en een poosje niet heb gewerkt was ik veel thuis en zaten we voortdurend op elkaars lip
5618710 dat is niet goed geweest voor onze relatie en daarom leek het ons beter om elkaar wat adem te geven
5618711 het verbouwen is klaar ik ben nu aan het inrichten toe
5618712 when i was a kid there was an ice storm in the suburbs we went to manhattan to stay with a friend of my moms there was nobody on the road it was this moment that couldve been scary for a kid but she made it festive
5618713 thats what nick is like he takes the hard part of a situation and makes it celebratory
5618714 hans klok komt hier we proberen er voor waar is de mol achter te komen of zijn droom om met een show in las vegas te staan aan zijn verwachtingen heeft voldaan de productie was nog bang dat ik in het pokertoernooi zou blijven ze werden al helemaal gek qua opnameschema dus ik heb ze net even dat ik er nog inzit haha
5618715 ik ga voor het programma ook met mijn tante linda naar de camping in itali waar zij als klein meisje kwam ik mag steeds met mensen naar eigen keuze op reis het is echt leuk om te doen
5618716 maar niks gaat vanzelf in het leven dat heb ik geleerd ik moet wel zelf actie ondernemen ik heb bijvoorbeeld met theodor holman een toneelstuk bedacht het was eerder een idee van theo van gogh hij wilde iets met mij n locatie en n vrouw helaas overleed hij nu komt het er hopelijk toch we willen na het toneelstuk meteen de film opnemen en zijn nu nog op zoek naar geld het gaat de gelukkigste dag heten over een jongen die dertig wordt het helemaal heeft gemaakt en alles heeft gedaan hij nodigt op zijn verjaardag al zijn vrienden uit en heeft het plan om als iedereen er is van dertig hoog te springen alleen er komt niemand behalve een serveerster en tussen mij en haar ontstaat een soort relatie
5618717 wie haar gaat spelen weet ik nog niet de eerste die bij mij en thijs r mer die het stuk regisseert opkwam was ariane schl ter ze is een fantastische actrice en heeft ook vaak met theo gewerkt maar we hebben haar nog niet gebeld dat thijs regisseert maakt voor mij de cirkel weer rond hij heeft in het verleden ook veel met theo gedaan
5618718 ja in januari word ik zelf dertig maar verder het is eigenlijk het toppunt van triestheid die jongen heeft het eigenlijk helemaal niet zo goed gedaan want hij heeft geen vrienden mijn vrienden zijn juist heel belangrijk voor me
5618719 ik zie niet op tegen dertig worden ik heb ook niet het idee over tien jaar wil ik dat en dat hebben bereikt dan word je teleurgesteld ik ben niet doelloos maar ik wil niet roepen als ik veertig ben dan in nederland word je snel arrogant genoemd daar heb ik trouwens een beetje schijt aan gekregen en aan vooroordelen dat vind ik een achterhaalde situatie
5618720 ik heb inmiddels dertig veertig films en series op mijn cv staan en die zijn cht niet allemaal betaald door mijn vader
5618721 youve got to start slow and give yourself time this is not something that is natural to me but its something that is a challenge
5618722 im always into challenging myself and seeing what i can do you have to start little by little and you just work up to it
5618723 the swimming is a killer im not going to lie im not a natural swimmer
5618724 het karakter liep gewoon ten einde bij een soap hoort nou eenmaal dat karakters komen en gaan
5618725 je hebt een zwarte vrouw in de serie doe er iets mee vanwege het beperkte aantal allochtonen geeft goede tijden slechte tijden geen goede afspiegeling van de nederlandse samenleving
5618726 het blijft natuurlijk ook een sprookje bovendien is bing nog een belangrijk karakter
5618727 ik ga quinty trustfull wel missen maar ze heeft het hartstikke druk en doet allemaal leuke dingen
5618728 ik denk dat ze bij goede tijden slechte tijden een vergissing hebben begaan ze willen verjongen omdat de kijkcijfers teruglopen en vonden dat chris nog niet zo verankerd was in de serie en dus weggeschreven kan worden als je als schrijver een personage niet de kans geeft om te verankeren zal dat ook niet gebeuren lijkt mij bovendien dalen de kijkcijfers altijd in het voorjaar dus dat argument is onzin
5618729 ik hou er gemengde gevoelens aan over ik heb zoveel goede vrienden gemaakt het is gewoon heel jammer als het aan mij lag zat ik er nog gewoon in wat vind ik dit een domme beslissing van de makers goed dorothea is een bemoeizuchtig karakter maar je vind haar wel ontzettend lief en ze is heel gevat en humoristisch volgens mij zijn er nog genoeg boeiende verhaallijnen voor haar te verzinnen en dan haal je zon anker uit je serie als die verjonging betekent dat er nog meer geneuzel over puberale romances en schooltentamens komen weet ik niet of ik nog wel blijf kijken ben ook erg benieuwd wat die verjongingsdrift gaat betekenen voor ankers als laura selmhorst jef alberts en barbara fischer
5618730 haar verhaallijn was gewoon ten einde onlangs zijn ook jonge acteurs als

5618733 were so looking forward to working with each again and we just need to find a time in our diaries when we can get into the studio together
5618734 she was called into the diary room and spoke to her agent and then her consultant in the uk she just burst into tears ran out and said to housemates i have cancer

5618739 lets lose the government centric mentality and engage in cooperative marketing with americas dynamic private sector youll find people clamoring for american products like ipods and nike shoes in places around the world where weve never had a consulate much less a library or a cultural center why not harness the power of americas global brand leaders to tell stories with cross cultural appeal if the u s government was engaged nikes pre olympics ad campaign could feature joe alexander an all american college basketball star who grew up playing pickup games on public courts in beijing and hong kong coca cola and the u s government could team up to sponsor concerts by dhani an indonesian rock star whose father and grandfather were militant islamists but who today preaches tolerance
5618740 there are countless acts of public diplomacy being engaged in every day by ngos companies cultural religious and athletic organizations but as a strategic matter it has been a scattershot approach the next u s president should make an effort to consolidate and guide these measures under a single roof that should span government and the private sector i endorse a public private institute for public diplomacy that puts public diplomacy resources where they are most needed and where they can most amplify american messages and values

5618751 me di cuenta que ra l era el nico aliado verdaderamente indispensable de su hermano y que su brillante direcci n de las fuerzas armadas asegur la revoluci n
5618752 ese papel le va perfectamente a ra l porque es mucho m s disciplinado que fidel ra l castro tiene una personalidad autoritaria

5618790 but each one of these repossession represents a tragedy for the families involved id urge the building societies and banks to do everything they can to avoid repossessions
5618791 after all its the fault of the banks and former building societies that people are in this position and the credit crunch is down to that
5618792 repossessions are increasing nationally and sadly theres no reason why cumbria should be excluded from that

5618798 the significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them
5618799 part of this evil is the attitude that it wont affect me personally yes this is more or less apolitical an outgrowth of unregulated consumerism the results of centuries of overconsumption and pollution will be starvation and death slow misery its believed throughout much of the us that individuals bear no responsibility for the fates of those whom their decisions affect its simply easier to live in denial than to confront the collective impact that our individual decisions make id be very cautious in proclaiming a message of gloom and doom people will simply turn off if 1 they think their actions will make no difference and 2 the standards of change and perfection are crafted too high people need to know that even a few little changes can make a big difference this is the flipside of the large negative collective impact that individual decisions can make if people are subjected to scorn for being anything less than vegetarians who ride their bikes and dont use fossil fuels the target audience will not identify with the environmentalist or the alternative model they are offering people need small tangible steps which theyre taking though they are coming at a pace far too slow to stop all damage this is in large part due to the anti regulatory chicago school of economics viewpoint that predominates still if you want worse look back at 1880s america change and hope for a better world are possible unless we just give up and abandon the possibility of change which is tantamount to letting evil win

5618828 simpatica che non perde occasioni per fare battute dicesi anche battutaro di prima categoria ma anche gentile allegro solare divertente
5618829 preferite che gli altri siano attratti dalla vostra personalit piuttosto che dal vostro aspetto questo non significa che non dobbiate mantenervi in forma ma che volete si sappia soprattutto che siete intelligenti
5618830 felice del binomio spirito e corpo vivi con le giuste percezioni e con la consapevolezza di chi non ha nulla da invidiare a nessuno ecco perch appari sempre sicuro di te e delle tue azioni estroverso e spregiudicato sempre allaltezza dosato

5618832 riesci a far buon uso del linguaggio sei sicuro di te stesso e non parli mai a vanvera non fai del linguaggio una ragione di vita ma quando occorre sai spiegarti perfettamente hai la capacit di trovare le parole giuste quando la situazione lo richiede senza per questo scadere nella retorica un buon uso della dialettica condito dalla condizione di saper ascoltare moderato

5618835 i pensieri che corrono le frasi che segnano le emozioni che proviamo
5618836 sei la persona pi tenera e dolce che abbia mai incontrato in questo mondo fatato
5618837 le mie coccole sono per quella persona che quando ho iniziato con il blog mi ha insegnato ad inserire immagini scritte e come si pu parlare con la gente anche se in modo virtuale sono le coccole di un genitore a cui tu come figlio hai insegnato a passare qualche ora nel blog e a conoscere tanta gente stupenda forse virutale ma forse pi vera di chi ti pi vicino una forte stretta di mano

5618865 literature adds to reality it does not simply describe it it enriches the necessary competencies that daily life requires and provides and in this respect it irrigates the deserts that our lives have already become

5618874 a very negative political atmosphere has been formed around tehran due to which frances total the last foreign company quit the country but if russia drops its attempt to consolidate its positions in the country it will cede this market to japan india and china

5618879 we cannot underestimate how intense rainstorms and flooding will be but we can prevent or lessen the damage caused by man made disaster
5618880 the presence of the figure of jesus itself is becoming diminished also with regard to the non christian contemporaries who surround us the figure is transformed from the lord a word that is avoided into a man who is nothing more than the advocate of all men the jesus of the gospels is quite different demanding bold the jesus who makes everything okay for everyone is a phantom a dream not a real figure the jesus of the gospels is certainly not convenient for us but it is precisely in this way that he answers the deepest question of our existence which whether we want to or not keeps us on the lookout for god for a gratification that is limitless for the infinite we must again set out on the way to this real jesus
5618881 it seems that if someone shows up preaching quite another jesus than we preached different spirit different message you put up with him quite nicely

5618951 left and right all americans know that freedom is better that slavery that love is better than hate kindness better than cruelty tolerance better than bigotry we dont always know how we know these things and yet mysteriously we know them nonetheless
5618952 the true complexity arises when we must defend these values in a world that does not universally embrace them when we reach the place where we must be intolerant in order to defend tolerance or unkind in order to defend kindness or hateful in order to defend what we love
5618953 whoever is kind to the cruel will end up being cruel to the kind

5618965 this study is encouraging because the fmri technique allowed us to see and compare the activity levels in specific regions of the brain before and during vision restoration therapy after examining the images the increased activity levels demonstrate progress associated with the treatment

5618967 after more than a month of use extensively testing the ts 409 we were left very favorably impressed especially with the seemingly endless array of features and available configurations the ts 409 pro offered good performance data protection and differentiated themselves from their competition
5618968 the added value comes from the extra disks and raid levels supported and when i say raid im not talking about a simple onboard controller the qnap ts 409 pro surprised me with raid 6 although slightly pointless with only 4 disks and features like online expansion and migration such functionality is usually only found on advanced controllers youd find in high end servers

5618986 the climax of the movie is really the thing that im most proud of because as a writer im a big believer in endings i think the ending of your story is when the meaning of your story is really revealed but i also think that just in terms of in setting up the story a good story for me at least always involves a character right before the climax taking a decisive action or making an important decision and usually you are going to make that decision is difficult as possible so what i was trying to do here was to push olive into this corner where she has to decide whether she is going to go on stage or not and at that moment she is weighing two value systems one is her dad who says there is no sense in entering a contest if you dont win or if you dont think you are going to win and then on the other shoulder is her grandpa who said we are going to have fun tomorrow we can tell them all go to hell and also a real loser isnt someone who doesnt win a real loser is someone who doesnt try so its that just to be didactic about it you know you are trying to have your character make a meaningful decision and really push them into the corner
5618987 in my experience people who are victim to sexual abuse as a child rarely get over it it can mean flash backs and memories triggered by something as simple as a smell
5618988 it impacts on people throughout their adult lives and can cause problems with relationships it can also cause difficulties in holding down a job because it can result in people having a mistrust of those in authority

5618993 i am proud to say that as a government and as a people we rose to the challenge and we worked in cooperation with everyone including international organisations and local non governmental organisations to ensure the safety of our fellow brothers and sisters from africa who reside in south africa
5618994 the outpouring of generosity the spirit of well being and the humanitarian assistance provided by ngos faith based organisations as well as by south africans from all walks of life is proof that our people will not tolerate the criminal acts of a few
5618995 this challenge is magnified under conditions where there is a continual influx of migrants
5618996 in multicultural diverse heterogeneous societies this is played out as a tension between a national identity and a specific group identity
5618997 for us in south africa it is important to articulate and embrace an inclusive vision that suggests common purpose and shared community can be achieved through inter group solidarity
5618998 we will fulfil our obligation to protect all people from other countries
5618999 through the work of the intergovernmental task team a coherent systematic and clear way forward was developed

5619128 in a way i quite understand why some people are put off by theology i remember once when i had been giving a talk to the r a f an old hard bitten officer got up and said ive no use for all that stuff but mind you im a religious man too i know theres a god ive felt him out alone in the desert at night the tremendous mystery and thats just why i dont believe all your neat little dogmas and formulas about him to anyone whos met the real thing they all seem so petty and pedantic and unreal now in a sense i quite agree with that man i think he had probably had a real experience of god in the desert and when he turned from that experience to the christian creeds i think he really was turning from something real to something less real in the same way if a man has once looked at the atlantic from the beach and then goes and looks at a map of the atlantic he also will be turning from something real to something less real turning from real waves to bits of coloured paper but the map is based on what hundreds and thousands of people have found out by sailing the real atlantic in that way it has behind it masses of experience just as real as the one you could have from the beach only while yours would be a single glimpse the map fits all those different experiences together in the second place if you want to go anywhere the map is absolutely necessary now theology is like the map merely learning and thinking about the christian doctrines if you stop there is less real and less exciting than the sort of thing my friend got in the desert doctrines are not god they are only a kind of map but that maps is based on the experiences of hundreds of people who really were in touch with god experiences compared with which any thrills or pious feelings you and i are likely to get on our own are very elementary and very confused and secondly if you want to get any further you must use the map you see what happened to that man in the desert may have been real and was certainly exciting but nothing comes of it it leads nowhere there is nothing to do about it in fact that is why a vague religion all about feeling god in nature and so on is so attractive it is all thrills and no work like watching the waves from the beach but you will not get to newfoundland by studying the atlantic that way and you will not get eternal life by simply feeling the presence of god in flowers or music

5619155 trojan horse technology has intrigued parkinsons researchers for years because of its theoretical potential to overcome the drug delivery hurdle one of the single most significant challenges facing the entire field

5619214 politicians will not have the luxury of blaming him any more
5619215 in no uncertain terms that governance would be impossible in the shadow of musharraf
5619216 now that that hurdle has removed itself the field is open for the politicians to address the most pressing problems facing the nation
5619217 determining what the priorities ought to be is not difficult militancy the economy and relations with india and afghanistan need to be addressed urgently
5619218 economists point out that the economic model adopted by musharrafs handpicked technocrats was a consumption boom that relied on easy credit fuelled by the inflow of dollars and global liquidity
5619219 when the spigot was shut off pakistan found itself much more economically vulnerable than it would have been if headline growth had not been the focus of economic policy
5619220 there is also the question of the stagnation of the rural economy which supports over 40 percent of the labour force on the presidents watch
5619221 was an unqualified failure when it came to developing the non economic institutions of the state
5619222 few could argue that on the generals watch parliament the judiciary the bureaucracy or the police improved in the end it is perhaps this failure more than anything else that led to his downfall
5619223 his speech monday announcing his resignation bordering towards the end on the maudlin explains a great deal of what went wrong
5619224 not because the many allegations levelled by musharraf against the elected government are accurate nor because he as he claims is the nations sole saviour but because his assessment of his tenure contains so much evidence of delusion and a refusal to acknowledge that one man alone cannot have a monopoly on altruism and good intention
5619225 it is indeed sad he was unable to recognize sooner that vast gaps existed between his deeds and his words and that as many failures as triumphs dotted the path along which he walked through the years
5619226 in the end his belief that he alone was a saint and all others villains worthy of little respect was a key factor in his undoing history shows that the greatest of leaders nelson mandela mohammad ali jinnah and mahatma gandhi to name just a few are all men able to see their own weaknesses and admit boldly to mistakes
5619227 indeed there was an edge of desperation that rang through the entire speech the final words of a man making an attempt to place a halo around his own head as he walked away into the twilight
5619228 the stance taken by the army chief in this respect is worthy true of praise and now that the field has been cleared the alleged conspiracies that hampered governance ended it is time for the elected government to show people their ballots were not wasted
5619229 had he separated them he could have squeezed some more legitimacy out of the political system at the same time his rule was not able to control lawlessness in the country
5619230 he did not like the idea of making up with the mainstream parties the national reconciliation ordinance nro was thrust on him by the americans and he went on record as saying that he had accepted it under duress

5619234 stephanie s got a sensational body all those swimmers have got bodies because they train so hard
5619235 she s on the front cover of new idea and women s day this week so she s hot
5619236 when was the last time we saw a local swimmer who s not getting married on the front cover of a magazine
5619237 stephanie s like a bullet from nowhere as far as the public s concerned
5619238 so not winning a gold medal has probably cost him millions of dollars
5619239 he s not on the scale of say stephanie rice who has three medals or libby trickett they

5619242 but tibet has been a province for them for a long long time to make the dalai lama an honorary citizen of canada was not a compliment to china
5619243 but for them the chinese the dalai lama is not a religious leader
5619244 i have to tell you that when you say they are resistant to change you should have been with me in 1994 when i visited china go to china today and youll see there has been a hell of a lot of change they have improved
5619245 you think that canada is very important in the world i remember when i was going to china the press saying mr chretien you have to tell the president of china to do this and do that oh really
5619246 you want me to tell the president of a country of 1 3 billion people you should do this and do that but i dont dare to say what to do to the premier of saskatchewan canadas province you have to put things in perspective
5619247 we are at the bottom of the ladder in terms of having any influence with china ask any businessman who has been to china and he will tell you the same thing
5619248 its 1 3 billion people and im telling you that they are moving fast

5619261 taking direct steps against infringers is an important and effective weapon in the battle against online piracy

5619292 ninety per cent of the work is convincing people that the eyes are real
5619293 the subtlety of the timing of eye movements is a big one people also have a natural asymmetry for instance in the muscles in the side of their face those types of imperfections arent that significant but they are what makes people look real
5619294 theres always been control systems for different facial movements but say in the past you had a dial for controlling whether an eye was open or closed and in one frame you set the eye at 3 4 open the next 1 2 open etc this is like achieving that degree of control with much finer movements
5619295 for instance you could be controlling the movement in the top 3 4mm of the right side of the smile

5619373 the internet moves so fast its hard to compete with
5619374 bloggers beat me to the stories most of the time but on several occasions in the past ive been able to get to the source first and report the most reliable information available to me
5619375 i have worked numerous leads for online gaming economy stories for years now
5619376 and cultured a vast quantity of insiders to feed me information with all these sources our paper will finally have the chance to write the best review possible complete with valid information and up to the minute reporting
5619377 after my stint with the daily news i moved over to investigative reporting
5619378 and i found my home i love investigative journalism particularly in the online gaming economy industry where there is always a juicy story to be told furthermore it is of great benefit to our community to report such news
5619379 as soon as our paper hit the presses i put the stories on all major wires
5619380 and response from beyond was instantaneous phone calls from various high volume news agencies rained in seeking further coverage and dibbs on the rest of the online gaming economy story
5619381 and i want to be very careful about releasing the most reliable and pertinent information related to this online gaming economy issue possible
5619382 but after about five years of experience i can say that it has become much easier and more exciting
5619383 its best to have a solid foundation in english and writing
5619384 and with time and experience youll become a pro at online gaming economy reporting in no time

5619386 ive always been weary of the online gaming economy industry and its operations but finally we now have the truth
5619387 its surprising to finally read this online gaming economy news
5619388 i thought all those rumors were just rumors but now i see that there is some truth to them after all
5619389 i knew it all along everyone told me my thoughts about the online gaming economy news stories were hyped up but now we all see that i was right on kudos to reporter rivette kawamura for an excellent piece

5619406 while its moving quite freely at the moment its condition would be expected to deteriorate over the next three days
5619407 weve consistently said it was a slim chance that it might link up with its mother or other whales but the reality is that in the wild for various reasons mothers sometimes reject their young
5619408 looking at its behaviour the way it was nuzzling up to yachts would indicate it was primarily still suckling
5619409 it really was trying to suckle just below the waterline and against the keel with its head engaged against the boat

5619424 because we have the arabic speaking community and new jersey has a lot of diversity we do get them here
5619425 at least reading this is more productive than sitting on my butt all day drinking beer and watching tv
5619426 look at the crap youre reading paris hilton like that can be compared to the olympics paris is a lazy silver spoon ditz that everyone in the world hates with a passion
5619427 well if you think that paris is a lazy ditz then how do you rate yourself
5619428 tell me exactly what you have accomplished in your life paris hilton is younger than you she has her own company she has made a movie she has recorded a song she has had a hit tv show and she is highly paid to go to events that lazy ditz has worked 1000 times harder than you ever have
5619429 which proves that she didnt have to do any of the things she has accomplished if she hadnt wanted to she doesnt have to do a thing and she still works harder than you
5619430 can you name one thing that you have done better than her

5619434 o abu abdillah the hadith that is narrated regarding the oppressors and those that aid them is it authentic
5619435 so i am considered to be an aide of the oppressors
5619436 no the aides of the oppressors are those that comb your hair and wash your clothes and prepare your meals and buy and sell from you as for you then you are one of the oppressors themselves

5619441 scientists found bird bones farther down the geologic column than archaeopteryx
5619442 i fully agree with your comments about the lack of direct illustration of evolutionary transitions in my book if i knew of any fossil or living i would certainly have included them i will lay it on the line there is not one such fossil for which one could make a watertight argument

5619448 a new survey says that british attitudes towards the united states are governed by ignorance of the facts for instance most people here and in europe believe america sold saddam most of his arsenal the truth is that just 0 46per cent of iraqs weapons came from the u s russia supplied 57 per cent china 12 per cent and the cheese eating surrender monkeys across the channel were responsible for 13 per cent the u s is routinely portrayed as anti islamic but in 11 out of 12 of the most recent conflicts between muslims and non muslims america has sided with the muslims other widespread myths such as americans being denied medical care if they dont have health insurance are simply not true filthy unregulated russian and chinese factories and power stations spew out poisonous gases but america is branded the worlds biggest polluter even though it has done more to cut carbon emissions since the year 2000 than any other country the liberal media has a vested interest in perpetuating such lies the left seems to be gripped with some kind of political penis envy of america which can be assuaged only by sucking up to tyrants and dictators
5619449 he cant be captain of the team on the bench i pick over what ive seen over the last two or three weeks and weve lifted the standard
5619450 now i look on the bench and i see dean sitting there along with carlos edwards michael chopra and anthony stokes thats a good sign of the progress weve made as a club
5619451 weve abandoned racing for today following 11mm of overnight rain
5619452 there has also been continuing rain this morning which started up again at around 8am
5619453 we will also hold an inspection at 4pm for racing for the rest of the week
5619454 we are looking at the feasibility with the british horseracing authority and other parties at staging todays group races later this week
5619455 we can feel its euro 2008 still in their mind and that they cant wait for the competition and the qualifying campaign to start
5619456 those things leave traces there are so many qualities within the team that this failure can hardly be understood
5619457 after a bad competition we are always expecting the next game to show it was just an accident
5619458 the new generation is coming and mixed with the experienced ones i believe we can do something good
5619459 i know that ill have to break my own record to make the final but i think that i am doing everything right and my confidence is sky high
5619460 i got this one right my mind is buzzing right now but i have to keep it under control
5619461 ill be getting a lane in the midddle for the semi final getting to mix it with the big boys and i feel that im ready
5619462 it was a big achievement for me to beat spearmon and that also helps my confidence
5619463 what the hell is this how could someone possibly lose a turtle
5619464 the naked truth about islam as i saw it in maharram beh
5619465 there is no sanctity but the human being and his freedom a solidarity campaign for liberal writer abdul kareem suleiman
5619466 kareems case is one example of the deterioration in egypts stated respect for human rights and religious freedom over the past year
5619467 the schools challenge aims to free chinese journalist shi tao and egyptian blogger kareem amer who are in jail for simple internet activities
5619468 listening is a great start but acting upon what you hear is more important
5619469 last year we didnt think shed even make it to the games
5619470 shes been able to be at pretty much full performance level but not train as often each week so it doesnt allow her to improve
5619471 she is pretty happy though and i think what she has achieved is starting to sink in
5619472 when you have reconstructive knee surgery at 15 you dont expect to make it to 27 so shes kind of on borrowed time
5619473 about how our lives are often dependent on the perceptions others have of us
5619474 it had a successful production at the national arts centre but i want to add to it
5619475 i believe passionately in the relationship between classical and new work thats been true of the great classic theatres including the royal shakespeare company and the national theatre of britain for a long time
5619476 if i was doing this just for myself i might have chosen a different course but i put pakistan first as always
5619477 this is the first time in pakistans political history where you have the people winning against establishment institutions
5619478 today parliament has become sovereign we can hold our head up high in the world and say that we too are a democracy
5619479 i dont want anything from anybody i have no interest i leave my future in the hands of the nation and people
5619480 even if i beat this impeachment relations between the presidency and the government can never be fixed pillars of the state parliament and the judiciary would be harmed and god forbid the army might have been dragged in
5619481 no charge sheet can stand against me because i never did anything for myself whatever i did i put pakistan first
5619482 we will continue to work with the pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on pakistans future and its most urgent needs including stemming the growth of extremism addressing food and energy shortages and improving economic stability
5619483 in the early 1970s i had a disastrous grand prix and she said dont worry
5619484 it has been a very difficult year i spent two thirds of my life with her
5619485 she was such a strategist behind everything jonathon and amy stepped up to the plate everyone picked up the load and thats the way it had to be
5619486 if you persevere long enough if you do the right things long enough good things will happen
5619487 when i found mac cones horse couldnt go i told torchy millar the canadian equestrian teams technical coach if a bookmaker was taking odds hed say the canadian team wouldnt have a shot at a medal
5619488 there was real synergy we had some issues and mac wasnt able to jump a second round but jill gave us a clear round to send us off were so pleased
5619489 theres no stable settlement these two guys mr sharif and mr zardari will now start slugging it out
5619490 the government says that it cant do its job because of his mr musharrafs interference now well see if that is true well see whos stopping who
5619491 and they are greedy corrupt there has been no change for 60 years so why should we expect it now
5619492 this resignation shows that pakistans political system has come of age everyone has shown maturity starting with mr musharraf it shows that the system works and the army did not intervene
5619493 if this continues i strongly suspect that pakistan will move from the ally category to the foe category
5619494 the impeachment threat was a very necessary step to restoring the constitution and getting civilian control over the military
5619495 she went for tests and results have come back and she has cancer
5619496 she was phoned up and informed this is a massive blow for her

5619503 i dont think there is nearly enough pro toronto urban credibility that the stephen harper government has established for there to be a swing in that tradition
5619504 does not have a city agenda does not have a toronto agenda and has a finance minister who says we are just whine a lot
5619505 there is a lot of good stuff this government has done for toronto
5619506 de terugtrekking van de russische troepen is van start gegaan maar men zal wel enkele dagen moeten wachten alvorens het zespuntenplan kan gerealiseerd worden
5619507 de volledige terugtrekking hangt af van het beleid van de georgische president mikhail saakasjvili en de acties van zijn troepen wij willen deze nachtmerrie zo snel mogelijk be indigen
5619508 ik had al pijn tijdens de warming up het was echt onmogelijk om de race te voltooien
5619509 ik wil mijn excuses aanbieden aan alle supporters ik vind het heel erg vervelend maar ben dankbaar voor alle steun die ik van iedereen heb ontvangen
5619510 de pijn was op dat moment echt ondraaglijk als ik de wedstrijd had uitgelopen liep ik het risico mijn achillespees onherstelbaar te beschadigen ik kan het gevoel dat op dat moment door me heen ging onmogelijk beschrijven
5619511 nu moet ik al mijn energie richten op het herstel van mijn blessure volgend jaar moet het dan op het wk maar gebeuren ik geef niet zo makkelijk op
5619512 we snappen allemaal dat een blessure liu dwong de race te verlaten we hopen nu dat hij snel hertelt zodat hij nog harder kan strijden voor de eer van het land
5619513 if i was doing this just for myself i might have chosen a different course but i put pakistan first as always
5619514 this is the first time in pakistans political history where you have the people winning against establishment institutions

5619520 since 1990 industry has reduced the co2 carbon dioxide intensity of oilsands production by 45 per cent
5619521 we will also be introducing tough new environmental regulations that will require even more dramatic cuts
5619522 insists that canada be the most responsible environmental producer of oil and gas in the world
5619523 we have developed under the auspices of nafta the most successful trading relationship in the world
5619524 the free flow of energy is an important part of that
5619525 weve actually developed the largest free flowing energy arrangement in the world thats working quite successful
5619526 and on the manufactured goods side we have a similarly extraordinary good arrangement but we are facing difficulties at the border
5619527 new fees and regulations are creating costly delays at the canada u s border
5619528 now more than ever we must take advantage of our proximity to each other so that we can reap all of the benefits offered by trade liberalization in our hemisphere

5619531 they just came flying out with no consideration at all for pedestrians
5619532 its a very difficult road because it all looks like its pedestrianised
5619533 it is very unclear where the road stops and starts
5619534 there are no road markings or curbs but they let motor vehicles down it and cyclists as and when they like they weave in and out of the pedestrians
5619535 maybe there should be a chicane that might make the cyclists slow down and dismount
5619536 if it had been an old lady it could have been a lot worse
5619537 this boy has suffered a nasty injury but the cyclist only stopped briefly to say sorry
5619538 i am keen to track down this cyclist and anyone who was in the area at the time who witnessed the incident

5619542 heels may look glamorous on the catwalks and on hollywood stars but theyre not appropriate for day to day work wear these dress codes apart from being blatantly sexist can lead to long term foot and back problems as women are forced to stand or walk around in high heels or ill fitting footwear feet bear the brunt of the daily working life and instead of worrying about what their staff look like employers should focus on the effect that the wrong shoes and prolonged standing can have employers should look at encouraging their staff to come to work in comfortable shoes and where possible provide the option of sitting
5619543 oh no apology is necessary actually i want to thank you you see im a genie and ive been trapped in that bottle for a thousand years now that youve released me im allowed to grant three wishes ill give you each one wish but if you dont mind ill keep the last one for myself

5619548 well since ive been trapped in that bottle and havent been with a woman in more than a thousand years my wish is to have sex with your wife
5619549 gee honey you know we both now have a fortune and all those houses what do you think
5619550 you know youre right considering our good fortune i guess i wouldnt mind but what about you honey
5619551 oh no apology is necessary actually i want to thank you you see im a genie and ive been trapped in that bottle for a thousand years now that youve released me im allowed to grant three wishes ill give you each one wish but if you dont mind ill keep the last one for myself

5619558 you know youre right considering our good fortune i guess i wouldnt mind but what about you honey
5619559 we in the south pacific take democracy seriously which is why we believe we cant sit idly by while our principles of democracy are shredded
5619560 when i was a kid there was an ice storm in the suburbs we went to manhattan to stay with a friend of my moms there was nobody on the road it was this moment that couldve been scary for a kid but she made it festive
5619561 thats what nick is like he takes the hard part of a situation and makes it celebratory
5619562 well see if they can turn their attention to governance and get a handle on their problems they have been using the musharraf thing as an excuse for non governance
5619563 this is really the moment of truth for pakistan if this fails it is unclear what will happen
5619564 it will take the new government a full year to work things out on counterterrorism a year to make the mistakes they have to make it is a huge experiment
5619565 the resignation of president pervez musharraf is a step toward moving pakistan onto a more stable political footing pakistan is a critical theatre in countering the threat of al qaeda and violent islamic extremism and i look forward to the government increasing its future cooperation
5619566 he hasnt effectively been leading pakistan for the last six months
5619567 youre truly not going to see any great changes in pakistan with musharrafs resignation with the exception you will start to see greater political infighting among the coalition partners
5619568 you could count on him to make tough decisions even though you could never count on him to completely follow through
5619569 it will probably be much harder to get decisive action as we did with musharraf the good news is that the democracy process is moving forward and it may be possible to create a more durable political framework
5619570 we have masses of water its just that the water companies let everything leak into the rivers germans are being ripped off because our politicians are useless everything has been run wrong for 20 years
5619571 in the uk it seems to be constantly raining and yet the reservoirs seem to dry out so quickly you have towns flooded the whole time and yet hosepipe bans are in force
5619572 theres just not enough being spent on infrastructure and the pipelines are just really bad thames water is dreadful they blame it on the wartime damage that nothings been really properly repaired since the 1940s
5619573 youve got to start slow and give yourself time this is not something that is natural to me but its something that is a challenge
5619574 im always into challenging myself and seeing what i can do you have to start little by little and you just work up to it
5619575 the swimming is a killer im not going to lie im not a natural swimmer
5619576 swimming is very foreign im a good athlete i feel like my stamina i can get it up there if i work really hard but the swimming is a killer olympic swimmer michael phelps he has nothing on me
5619577 the results from the stress tests indicate that the capital ratios of the banks are solid and can withstand considerable financial shocks
5619578 we put some urchins in a tank and got them feeding on algae then we recorded them the noise they were producing caused spikes at certain frequencies
5619579 the noise they make is the sound of those teeth scraping on the rocks a large urchin will have a low resonance frequency while a small urchin will have a higher frequency
5619580 when they emerge from their crevices at dusk theyre probably really hungry munching away quite rapidly
5619581 they have another big feed before they go to sleep at dawn
5619582 its a huge increase 20 to 30 decibels which is an increase of a hundred to a thousand times the background level
5619583 this discovery may eventually lead to enhanced understanding of psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia obsessive compulsive disorder and attention deficit disorder all conditions in which a persons ability to remember and change such rules is impaired
5619584 this indicates that different parts of our brains store different kinds of memories and information
5619585 that provides clues about how the human brain accomplishes complex goal directed behaviours that require remembering and changing abstract rules an ability that is disrupted in many mental illnesses
5619586 we are delighted that the british public has voted enid blyton its best loved author her storytelling is timeless and this result confirms that her books are still a firm favourite today
5619587 what makes blyton so successful is her imaginative exciting and magical style her writing has sent countless young readers on thrilling adventures and we hope that new generations will continue to enjoy her enchanting stories
5619588 after consulting with advisors listening to people who understand the conflict and polling the issue let me reiterate my previous statement whatever john mccain said goes double for me you guys should stop fighting and play nice together if you dont im going to tell the un security council and then youll be sorry
5619589 if you looked at barack obamas record public statements and campaign platform as of any time before june 3 2008 the last day of the democratic primaries you could detect a trend on issue after issue after issue there was a conservative position a moderate position a liberal position and then there was an obama position once he felt he won the democratic nomination nothing is final until after the democrat convention though obama started moving so quickly to re brand himself as a centrist that youd be forgiven getting whiplash watching him move his own supporters have ranged from bewildered to in denial to enraged to laying out lists of things he must not concede meanwhile in some cases the mccain camp is simply refusing to accept that obama has abandoned his former position preferring to run against the less ambiguous left winger
5619590 basically mccain over the years has presented himself to the public not as an ideas guy but as a moderate pragmatist one who goes here and there sometimes without a ton of predictability or philosophical consistency
5619591 at the end of the day john mccain can get away with this approach on domestic policy issues because nobody doubts that the test of mccains leadership in foreign affairs or in times of crisis is his very lengthy record in those areas regardless of the more mundane business of domestic government unlike obama mccain has earned that credibility because unlike obama mccain has more to back up his words than just words themselves
5619592 she is devastated it is a terrible thing to be told you have cancer she broke down while she was on air and told some of the other housemates she had some bad news and had to go home when i spoke to her she was very upset frightened and i tried to reassure her as best i could
5619593 it looks like her cancer is at an early stage but we will have to wait until she gets back to britain and sees a specialist and has more tests
5619594 it is pretty obvious that she was looking forward to her time in the house but her health is the first priority and she is flying back for treatment and more tests

5619621 it is important now that we proceed as quickly as possible with these flood relief measures
5619622 thats why i did give an absolute commitment to the council that we will ensure that money is made available and it happens
5619623 were providing clarity for planning authorities in assessing flooding risk
5619624 if you take a major urban centre and theres a town centre at risk of flooding were not blocking the local authority from considering development but they must consider what to build not a hospital or sewerage treatment works but maybe a car park

5619632 i have noticed including myslef websites are flying up and down the serps for me it started about july 20th two sites lost ranking for every keyword then two weeks later came back with worse ranking these are not a penalty when you have a penalty goolge will inform you via webmaster tools matt cutts has confirmed this also its nothing to do with the google dance the google dance lasts no more than 10 days
5619633 google wouldnt introduce it so quickly if they were to bring a new algo in think about it
5619634 definitely some major changes are taking place especially in terms of pr
5619635 i hope so its very frustrating one week im ranking 5th page 1 the next im page 15
5619636 i have similar problem so donot know what is going on with g have to do alot on content and link building then wait
5619637 google did about 450 algo changes in 2007 it means 1 2 changes per week do we have a reason to believe that there will be less changes this year google does not publish or promote all smaller adjustments
5619638 a major algo change would cause big ranking changes for millions of sites that hasnt happened
5619639 yeah i was a pr2 site i added a ton more backlinks from higher ranked sites pr 4 and my page rank is now 0 and my serps are down a bit
5619640 i have a number of high traffic keywords that are bobbing up and down on page 1 of google
5619641 worlds longest holocaust in the history of mankind and loss of human lives
5619642 the brownback legislation did not authorize or support any claims or settlements from indians or tribes against the united states campbell believes that any formal federal apology should not incorporate the words holocaust or genocide since he feels the processes of colonization were complex and that purposeful extermination of indians wasnt always the intent of early colonists he also notes that its easy to blame everything on europeans but the fact is that some of the bad things that were happening were here long before they got here the colorado resolution specifically mentions the forced removal of the cherokee nation in 1838 and the sand creek massacre of between 150 and 200 indian people composed of mostly elderly men women and children by members of the colorado territory militia in 1864 it also notes the many indian deaths due to disease that were magnified by european conquest
5619643 its a horrendous slap in the face after 120 years of injustice to have this kind of ruling come down

5619652 over the long run fuel prices do have an effect a longer term process of adaption is set off
5619653 it is possible that the recent oil price increases have set off such a process and that if oil prices remain on an upward trajectory the adaption process may still have a long way to run

5619659 screen shot showing me that google may have added some relevant blog posts under the search result as opposed to showing the typical sitelinks
5619660 i noticed a few weeks ago that sites using google knol or google pages were getting great positions in the google serps search engine result pages but now the trick is out and people are inundating knol to grab greater positions in the serps than they could attain with normal means
5619661 google analyzes backlinks posted on web pages to calculate pagerank which in turn influences the search results ranking of pages but web pages arent the only places to find url pointers
5619662 seo has evolved into more than what it was 24 months ago as google slowly expands its ability to read flash objects as mobile search begins to pick up steam as new search engines hit the ground running seo shows no signs of stunting its evolution

5619666 you could hear her going on and on because she was standing right behind the stage curtain shes talking and talking meanwhile you have the entire audience waiting almost two hours for the taping to start
5619667 she leaves us waiting and everyone is sitting there complaining and then she comes out and doesnt say a word about it she didnt even say hello she got right into her script
5619668 she had the audience prance down the street and then release black balloons it was so disorganized people fell over the press outside and almost trampled two little girls

5619672 you all know we have bent as far backward as possible to give peace a chance
5619673 the patience of our soldiers in trying to uphold the primacy of the peace process is very commendable but at some point we really have to act decisively
5619674 if they cant control them the government will certainly control them

5619679 i had a drill sergeant with the full tower of power
5619680 this is a guy you dont want to mess with
5619681 mentally ive been ready for it since i signed the papers even though i was still a kid when i signed them
5619682 i guess i still am just a more mature kid
5619683 ive just personally decided im not going to watch the news the whole year hes gone
5619684 i know that neils time is always in gods hands
5619685 its amazing when you see so many dead people you stop feeling very much about it one way or the other
5619686 i didnt think at the time that it would be any big deal
5619687 i admit i got arrested i put myself in the spotlight so to speak
5619688 but for them to keep me there for seven months to find out i was telling the truth come on thats a little much
5619689 and when information came to our attention that he was a naturalized u s citizen we released him
5619690 she told me that people say anything to get out of here
5619691 which means we would meet with people and give them advice on what they can do when they represent themselves
5619692 i was naturalized here in the seattle ins building your honor while i was in the service
5619693 sir you get documentation when you become a united states citizen
5619694 where is your documentation you simply say im a citizen you get a piece of paper
5619695 i dont think youre a united states citizen simply because you think that some paper was filed on your behalf
5619696 at one point i just figured there was nothing more i could do
5619697 its not because we think were making mistakes hand over fist
5619698 but more because we want to ensure were doing the job the best we can
5619699 the more the detention system and the more the whole process of enforcement happen the more we get these situations
5619700 this case highlights the issues but its not just about this one case its about the problems that exist when you put people in detention and they dont always have access to legal assistance
5619701 even if they admit they were wrong what is that going to change they can say we detained you were sorry mistakes happen what good is that going to do im sure im not the first person im quite certain i wont be the last
5619702 returning these properties to the nisqually tribe allows us to preserve our cultural heritage and honor our ancestral home
5619703 our people have lived on this land for hundreds of years and we are honored to once again be stewards of these important sites
5619704 theyre just going to be a property developer on that
5619705 its not trust land so what its not going to be is a casino
5619706 the primary is the place where you take stock and say are there any surprises there
5619707 we have to be more thoughtful in terms of how we spend it and more effective

5619710 we already offer two really well diversified international etfs so i dont think we have any plans to offer this as an etf
5619711 i think it would only follow that they do an etf
5619712 anything that vanguard launches thats broad based would attract assets
5619713 were trying to reflect those underlying stock assets rather than fund ownership
5619714 the foreign tax credit is one of them we can better track the index and we have more flexibility in how we manage taxes in the portfolio
5619715 its an opportunity to make some transactions in a tax free way
5619716 we want to make sure we do this in a way that has the lowest impact to shareholders its a combination of markets and cash flows in and out of the funds that will allow us to get to that point
5619717 it is consistent with vanguards mission and a good idea
5619718 its a relief to all the families and the victims in this case
5619719 i was just hoping that he would never get out of prison praying that he would never get out to hurt anybody again
5619720 i wish i could meet them and give them a hug
5619721 as it is and i hope it is i will die in prison
5619722 i believe the punishment does fit the crime and i understand that i hear on tv all the time that everybody deserves a second chance i know i dont
5619723 im just sorry that we had to go to court
5619724 it is our intention to move forward with the relocation of the division of traffic safety to harrisburg after sept 11
5619725 we are confident the law is on our side in this matter
5619726 there was absolutely no rational basis for moving jobs from springfield
5619727 i wouldnt be here tonight if i didnt think we could do it
5619728 were in negotiations for financing for the property acquisition and the hotel construction
5619729 by reducing the residential component by 25 percent i no longer see a benefit to the city that warrants the use of such powerful tools as eminent domain and tif
5619730 although we dont see a lot of cases the cases that we do see its just a horrible disease
5619731 when they get infected the horse develops a fever theyre getting depressive and dopey and go off their feed and look sad
5619732 if your horse has a fever treatment needs to be started right away
5619733 it was definitely frightening and there was a lot of whoa what are we going to do next and whats the morning going to bring
5619734 i did give documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned
5619735 dont cry im here across the hall 10 feet away
5619736 and there will be probably be a lot more than that before its over
5619737 last year we wound up with 16 to 17 different languages
5619738 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5619739 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5619740 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5619741 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5619742 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5619743 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this
5619744 eric boquet eyeblaster le march a plus que jamais besoin dun adserver ind pendant
5619745 the idea is to get energy relief money as well as the permanent fund dividend before winter hits so people have their money to offset the astronomical costs we are seeing for energy
5619746 most anybody when they leave their country their first choice would be to go back home if they could
5619747 if you look at these groups coming here theyre among the most unlikely to go back and those having the most trouble
5619748 because we have the arabic speaking community and new jersey has a lot of diversity we do get them here
5619749 well have muslim and christian refugees too so we hope the community will welcome everyone
5619750 theres a lack of well paying jobs in the area
5619751 when folks have a chance to move on they move on
5619752 teachers pay more attention to people messing around than people who want to learn
5619753 the only way to make money is selling dope on the corner
5619754 it gives a really powerful message that if youre not in school were going to your home
5619755 most of the time we find dropouts not working and not happy with life
5619756 education is truly an equalizer i want our youngsters to have that opportunity
5619757 i did give documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned
5619758 everybody in this room could be donating to some other cause or to their own well being but i want to thank you
5619759 faced with the embarrassing prospect of holding a fundraiser with one of jack abramoffs closest associates the mccain campaign scrambled today to scratch ralph reed from tonights program but voters deserve to know the answers to the real questions raised by reeds involvement
5619760 first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5619761 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5619762 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5619763 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5619764 squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5619765 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5619766 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home

5619769 in the end he also became the man who couldnt deliver bush was very slow to realize that he either had been had by musharraf or that musharraf was not up to the task historians will debate this for years
5619770 the new pakistani general hes just been elected not elected this guy took over office
5619771 it wasnt a personal relationship but musharraf tried to play it effectively for domestic advantage
5619772 we pretty much played the musharraf card ad nauseam eventually to pakistans detriment
5619773 so far ive found him to be a man of his word
5619774 the fundamental question i have for president musharraf is will these elections be under emergency rule or law because if they are its going to be hard for well itll be hard for those of us who have belief that hes advanced pakistans democracy to say thats thats still the case
5619775 president bush and vice president cheney backed a discredited dictator which has undercut our ability to work with the new government to eliminate the terrorist sanctuary that has re emerged in pakistans tribal areas
5619776 president musharraf took his country a long way in turning it back from the extremism that was starting to characterize it at the time of sept 11 2001 he also kept his promise to try and help a transition to free and fair elections we didnt agree with everything he did especially the state of emergency but he did take off the military uniform the elections were free and fair
5619777 he tried to play both ends moving against certain terrorist targets but more broadly letting the terrorists increase their influence in his own country he campaigned for democratic reform then staged faulty elections to help himself stay in power
5619778 it took a little while to get the plans out and just how we were going to do this
5619779 a year ago we didnt even have the equipment to move to the units
5619780 the intent of this ordinance is to try to smear protesters and make them look as if they are somehow criminal or somehow going to engage in some kind of gross conduct
5619781 anarchists witches clowns iraq vets artists sdsers radical queers immigrants earth first ers rebel democrats parents precarious workers and others
5619782 come august the democrats attempt at co opting our energies and power will fall short as we make it clear that change will come from below not above in the streets and not in their stadiums

5619785 the world has seen that even today there are political morons who are ready to kill innocent and defenseless people in order to satisfy their self serving interests while compensating for their own inability to resolve complicated issues by using the most terrible solution by exterminating an entire people
5619786 i think that there should be no mercy for that we will do our best not to let this crime go unpunished
5619787 you just dont move more than 1 200 tanks and 15 000 soldiers into a country within 12 hours without previous planning
5619788 were talking about pulling our troops away to the borders of south ossetia they will not be on georgia territory
5619789 russians have committed to withdrawing and they need to withdraw and so that is what we are looking for
5619790 we were all set and then the georgians came up with a bunch of new requirements with no time for us to act so the time to exchange prisoners was interrupted
5619791 russian forces continue to consolidate their enclaves in south ossetia and abkhazia
5619792 mounting evidence that russian and georgian military used armed force unlawfully during the south ossetian conflict
5619793 highlights the need for international fact finding missions in georgia
5619794 i really look forward to it they honour certain years but even if it isnt your year you get to meet people who come back again and again
5619795 i was very shy so i wasnt too outgoing but it was a good year we all worked hard
5619796 in all my years of teaching i never met a child i didnt like some might drive you crazy but not one i didnt like
5619797 all in all were pretty impressed it was definitely a success
5619798 there were a few bugs to work out but that comes with every new event
5619799 the rain hurt us a bit it downpoured for about five minutes and most people went to their cars
5619800 its the dirt man the mud thats the attraction you just hang on and go for the ride
5619801 it was like a beacon canadian tire they help people but they wouldnt even look at us
5619802 its sitting in front of a 10 bay garage and another mechanic is sitting in their parking lot fixing it
5619803 our bays are equipped to only handle a regular car
5619804 its not because we didnt want to help but through insurance reasons were not covered working out in the parking lot
5619805 marty cagan is a product visionary his addition to our board is a major win for our product direction and for our company
5619806 martys leadership in developing and managing product roadmaps will help us drive the onforce marketplace forward as we expand into new categories and countries
5619807 it all originated when we were looking for a project to raise further money for the terry fox foundation
5619808 pat mccallum kim dawe val shupe carol thorne judy matheson and i met in judys kitchen when we came up with the idea of a terry fox texas scramble golf tournament little did we realize how it would grow and grow and grow in the coming years
5619809 none of us had been involved in anything like organizing a golf tournament for charity we had a very small committee back then compared to today we had to find our way but fortunately we got off on the right foot
5619810 we travelled that first year to the lost creek golf club near waverley the course appeared to be quite new and we had entries from 10 teams
5619811 first of all its just a great team taking part with this tournament the organizers deserve so much credit we all get so much out of it we all have a great time every year and wed miss any other golf tournament just to play in this one
5619812 money is raised for a great cause because cancer touches so many families its such a serious disease but its uplifting to see people come together and rise to the occasion year after year to walk around and see those signs on every hole with the donations attached to me thats really something
5619813 our terry fox golf idea has come a huge way
5619814 we have a great group of about 12 working on planning everyone gets a lot of enjoyment out of seeing everything come together and for such an important and worthwhile cause terry fox money goes completely to cancer research
5619815 that will importantly mean 14 400 towards cancer research adding extra money to the cause we have also received donations for 32 signs that will be positioned on greens around the course
5619816 a donation is made on behalf of someone deceased or in honour of someone it is a real good feeling when you come up to a hole and see a sign dedicated in memory of someone it is a nice way to remember people
5619817 when the rain lingers it creates a sense of isolation for the average person it might not be so bad but for someone with a mental health illness negative feelings are magnified it implies a feeling of hopelessness
5619818 its like the rain clouds follow me everywhere and a few days of rain can feel like months theres a sense of lost time and even the small things trigger negative emotions
5619819 i sleep more and isolate myself more ive cancelled appointments and isolated myself instead of being with others which would have been healthier
5619820 the numbers this summer have been higher and i believe it is directly related to the lack of sunshine weve gone from typically eight participants to 14
5619821 people are indoors more and that can lead to isolation daily sudoku
5619822 the conventions are an important part of the presidential election process and hp is pleased to partner with both parties for the conventions in 2008 just as we did in 2000 and 2004
5619823 the first pcs in the industry to meet the latest energy star standards meaning they use less energy and will cost less for the conventions to power compared to older pcs
5619824 squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5619825 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5619826 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5619827 is not something we can negotiate bilaterally with the united states
5619828 we regret that formal consultations have not been successful in resolving our concerns over the duties that the eu is imposing on several high tech products
5619829 we believe that these duties are inconsistent with the eus commitments on these products and that they discourage technological innovation in the it sector
5619830 is not something we can negotiate bilaterally with the united states
5619831 in effect the eu is taxing innovation a move that could impair continued technological development in the information technology industry and raise prices for millions of businesses and consumers
5619832 zander will probably miss the rangers and st mirren games but we have a week off after that so he should be available for the hamilton game

5619863 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country

5619865 it is an issue of significant magnitude and it does need proper assessment and all governments working together to minimise the risks and ensure there is as little damage as possible

5619914 if it does continue to strengthen you could see some of that be a headwind to top line growth

5619917 i think most of my constituents want to see these things on their television
5619918 a lot of them dont use the internet they want to see our meetings on tv where the other cities are
5619919 im not sure how many people watch the meetings on television
5619920 i know i never do i get my news from the newspaper and the pamphlets that are sent out
5619921 i think we need to discuss whats the best bang for our buck as far as communicating with constituents before we just say this is what were going to do
5619922 we need to focus on whats happening in puyallup and not whats on tv
5619923 id like to see all of us focus on our issues and not what camera were looking at

5619927 theres a collection of ideas about parenting that are implicated through research that i want to share with people
5619928 weve made enough progress in narrowing gaps in the last 31 years that im suggesting its highly plausible that we can do more
5619929 my focus and our focus really has been how do we move further down that path of closing the achievement gap
5619930 theres some issues with black and latino parenting that we need to take seriously
5619931 we accept closing achievement gaps as one of our major goals
5619932 a great deal still depends on the decisions and good judgment of the next president the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines
5619933 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5619934 first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5619935 its because of that experience that when i hear that women are being treated unfairly in the workplace where theres injustice and were not seeing the basic principle of equal pay for equal work i get mad and i get frustrated
5619936 the truth is although weve made enormous strides over the last 20 30 years what remains the case is that women typically make a little over 75 cents on every dollar thats earned by men
5619937 but they rarely matter in terms of winning a state or region

5619942 i knew i had to throw well i had to step it up

5619948 if there was a hunting trip if he could hunt wild pigs in china he would be here
5619949 he even has a valid passport no one in my family has a valid passport traveling to china was not the highest priority
5619950 we have lived in this neighborhood for 2 years we dont know any of our neighbors and that is totally sad because basically we rock and they need to know us so an ice cream party would be a good excuse to get everyone together and allow them to bask in our pure awesomeness
5619951 not only do we make results but we develop players as well
5619952 at the start of the season its always very difficult to assess how good players like
5619953 its a tricky situation people want to see big names and they want to see good young players as well
5619954 there have been not that many problems for me to adapt to playing in england
5619955 when i first met the boss he said that maybe i would need a bit of time maybe up to six months but actually i felt really good straight away
5619956 i have a personal programme with the physio to get stronger because everyone has told me english football is different with more contact
5619957 it is just to be stronger and to be able to cope with the 50 50s and the intensity of english football i am working hard in training and felt really good out on the pitch
5619958 i could not dream of a better start to score in my first game after four minutes
5619959 now i will have to continue week in and week out and hopefully i can keep playing like this that will be brilliant
5619960 i did not feel nervous every time i go on the pitch i always want to take a lot of pleasure from the game i do not put pressure on myself
5619961 before the game the manager told me everything would be fine and with the football we play at arsenal we would be ok
5619962 i just wanted to enjoy myself and that is what i did
5619963 he sees a good vision of the game and that left flank suits him quite well
5619964 maybe there is a bit of robert pires in him because he looks to be able to change direction very easily and a little bit the same style of run he is a bit smaller but theres a bit of pires in there
5619965 he had a bad season last year because he had meningitis
5619966 he didnt recover properly for three months and then they rushed him back to play of course he was not at the expected level but the year before everybody wanted him
5619967 sometimes you have to be brave enough when everybody says he is not good
5619968 well it was the first game of the season we had a physical game on wednesday night and i was worried before the game that we would not be sharp we made a good start were always in control but could not finish the game off
5619969 you have that old story in the game when you cannot finish the game off you feel you deserved to be punished when theres 10 minutes to go
5619970 i am pleased with the fact that we didnt concede a goal we scored two on wednesday one today so its better than the reverse overall it was a good week for us a winning start a win in the champions league so yes a good week
5619971 he has shown he is an intelligent player he has good technique and can integrate well with the team he also worked hard for the team he added something that people wanted from him in france and that was to score goals he started to score some goals towards the end of last season and had a scoring start here today
5619972 im not really worried about the lack of goals because i dont feel we were sharp enough to finish off what we created
5619973 we created many chances but its about converting them look at the amount we scored in the last 10 years and you can see we scored a few even last year we had a very good striking force it was not so much offensively we were punished last year it was defensively
5619974 we just started the season and i know ill hear that we must win a trophy 38 times and im prepared for that
5619975 he has shown in pre season he is a good player and he will take part in our team we have four strikers and he is one of them in a season like this one we have 60 games so he will play games but he is going to mexico tomorrow afternoon
5619976 they defended intelligently and played in a positive way you expected them at some stage to crumble but they never did and they kept going until the last second of the game they have fantastic spirit and a positive attitude towards the game they were not dirty they were resilient and well organised
5619977 we made 83 points last year and lost only three games we have stability in this club that allows us to feel that we can improve on last year we lost three games and in two of the games we were leading 1 0 with 20 minutes to go we lost some big names but what is important is what we produce on the pitch last year we were four points behind man united and we didnt win a trophy however we won the trophy of the most unlucky team we had injuries to players for very long periods too we lost tomas rosicky robin van persie and eduardo
5619978 is a trophy to finish 12th and win the carling cup for me a real quality of a team is to fight for the championship if you dont win it youre very frustrated but what is important for me is the consistency of the club and of the team you have to accept that the level is very high when you fight for a title two or three points difference in the end is not a big gap last year that is where we finished we were there until the end
5619979 xbox 360 and ps3 can never recover their losses for this generation of consoles
5619980 the faster consoles move to online models the faster they will die because they will disintermediate the retail channles they depend on
5619981 two years ago we were over 20 points behind the leaders last year we were four points behind that means we made a significant move forward
5619982 a four point gap after 38 games is down to one or two decisions in your favour one or two injuries that you dont have one ball going in instead of hitting the bar
5619983 we feel we were a fraction short now we want to show we can make up the four points that made the difference last year
5619984 this season i feel it will be more down to starting well and being more relaxed when it comes to the crunch point
5619985 last year we were leading the premier league due to a good start so lets focus on the short term goals and show later on that weve learned from when we dropped off last season
5619986 usually the teams that come up give you a good game
5619987 we know west brom will be up for it out of the three teams who just came up from the championship they have the most experience in the premier league but it is always our target to win the first match
5619988 but i dont think we lost the title last year due to lack of overall experience because the young players produced a great season
5619989 we lost as a unit because we didnt have the experience of winning the title hopefully we have learnt from that now
5619990 anyway i believe it is not just experience that wins the league it is the talent and quality of your display
5619991 the dominance of english teams will be less than last year because real madrid barcelona ac milan not this year but in other years and inter will not just sit and watch the champions league
5619992 i was at the ajax tournament and inter had 18 players out on the bench they needed another bench for the players who were not involved
5619993 when i looked at the 10 names who were not involved they were 10 real names and patrick vieira wasnt even on it
5619994 it is always very nice in pre season and everyone wants to respect each other
5619995 when it comes to points it becomes a bit different
5619996 it is like when you go to church on a sunday the priest says everyone has to be respectful and generous but when you come out of the church everyone is not generous and respectful
5619997 we are prepared to do whatever it takes to win a football game but within the respect of the game
5619998 are we ready to kill someone to win a game no because you have to respect the rules in football
5619999 the beauty in the game is to win within the respect of the rules but we will do whatever it takes to win a football game
