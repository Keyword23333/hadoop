4520003 in this case the western hemisphere is facing the sun so what we see is a strong negative nee shown in green in which vegetation is taking up co2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis the yellow areas are taking up less co2 because of low sun angle e g northern canada less vegetation e g in the western u s or because of the seasonal cycle e g parts of south america
4520004 i believe this snapshot was created for the month of july from our simulation so it is summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the southern hemisphere
4520005 that animation shows a net release of co2 from the biosphere i e a positive nee primarily in the evening in red and an uptake of c02 by the biosphere i e a negative nee in green the colors change as the sun rises and sets the co2 release in the evening is primarily the result of heterotrophic respiration which comes from microbes and other organisms that decompose litter e g leaves woody debris dead roots etc and soil

4520044 we can not hope to maintain our rights as a free nation if we are willing to infringe one of our precious liberties the right to vote
4520045 i am announcing today that even though i have the law on my side i have decided not to pursue an election contest with the republican primary board i love east tennessee and i love america therefore it is in the best interest of everyone concerned that i concede the election to my primary opponent i have contacted mr roe and made him aware of my decision
4520046 we live in a blessed nation god has given me the great honor to serve the people of east tennessee in the state legislature for eight years and in washington as the congressman from the 1st congressional district for the past two years for that i will be forever grateful
4520047 the people of east tennessee both democrats and republicans are some of the best people on earth
4520048 this crossover voting is not only illegal under tennessee state law it is harmful to our very system of government
4520049 the right of political parties to determine their own nominees goes to the core of the associational rights guaranteed by the first amendment of the united states constitution and it has been upheld by the supreme court of the united states
4520050 in no area is the political associations right to exclude more important than in the process of selecting its nominees
4520051 a single election in which the party nominee is selected by nonparty members could be enough to destroy the party
4520052 tennessee law recognizes the important associational rights of political parties and it makes clear that people must be bona fide members of the political party in whose primary they seek to vote
4520053 rather state law is clear that voters seeking to cast a ballot in a party primary are only eligible if one of two conditions are met 1
4520054 this law not only protects the rights of republican voters in their primary elections it also protects the rights of democratic voters in their primary elections
4520055 for instance it is unfortunate but it appears that some members of my own party used this same crossover voting technique in west tennessee to subvert the will of democratic voters in a very close state senate race
4520056 when members of the opposing party participate in the other partys primary unlawfully they are weakening the two party system that is central to our very form of government
4520057 there is clear and overwhelming evidence that the integrity of the august 7 2008 republican primary was violated by large numbers of crossover voters who voted to change the outcome of the republican primary
4520058 both candidates and political parties should think twice before they violate the letter or intent of this law if this law is violated we are setting a very dangerous precedence for the future
4520059 we can not hope to maintain our rights as a free nation if we are willing to infringe one of our precious liberties the right to vote elections do matter
4520060 it is my sworn constitutional duty as an elected representative to fight for the rights of all citizens without regard to their political party affiliation
4520061 i am announcing today that even though i have the law on my side i have decided not to pursue an election contest with the republican primary board
4520062 may god bless the first congressional district and may god bless america

4520077 todays children are actually faster in development and must be made to recognise parts of the body on time as well as letting them know nobody should touch them unnecessarily
4520078 it is important to know proper names for all body parts they need to know that touching in secret is never okay

4520086 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4520087 why do teachers need guns what if a child steals the gun do we really need this blah blah blah
4520088 yeah id like some steam uh huh some steam would be good i said just sitting there on my ass
4520089 we did what we had to do to clarify the situation
4520090 we dug deep into our records to bring this to a conclusion regulators were satisfied with our accounting when we issued checks we closed the books on this issue
4520091 mike tyson went to jail for what cl amp p is doing to the citizens of connecticut
4520092 that cl amp p has not provided a full and fair settlement
4520093 some 10 15 soldiers sprayed our car with weapons for at least 4 or 5 minutes i could not move the vehicle since the engine broke down we shouted at the soldiers that we were journalists we also took our t shirts off and waved them out of windows some 4 or 5 minutes later soldiers approached us
4520094 besides the issue has been proven a thousand times over

4520097 2005 for the originally scheduled time of sarahs death had they not time jumped to 2007 in the premiere though i cannot imagine glau bot comes from a timeline apparently in which not only was the nuclear war delayed past the point at which it occurred in the t1 and t3 timelines 1997 and 2004 respectively but in which for some reason leukemia took at least a year longer to kill sarah
4520098 my son is destined to lead a rebellion against killer robots in the future after a nuclear war so robots have been sent to our time to kill him and one to protect him
4520099 2011 timeline created at the end of t2 but each went back into that initial timeline and created a different subsidiary timeline the loken spawned one with an earlier war and the glau spawned one we shall see 2007 and counting keep your fingers crossed
4520100 good terminators back to counter act this its because the nuclear war has already happened and terminators are always sent back post war
4520101 were trying to stop a sentient computer program from using nukes and killer robots to destroy humanity
4520102 the value of a multiverse as compared with a universe lies in this that where there are cross currents and warring forces our own strength and will may count and help decide the issue it is a world where nothing is irrevocably settled and all action matters

4520107 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4520108 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them

4520131 if scalpers had wads and wads of tickets then they must have done pretty good business

4520133 its a premium event theres not nfl games in canada we brought them theyre not happening 10 times a year like they are in the u s theyre happening once twice a year so its a premium event and its expensive were operating on a cost recovery basis in and around the games

4520143 i was impressed by the quality of the craftsmanship but just as much by the fact that they were ardent union members and socialists and anarchists who were very committed to political and economic change
4520144 all these interests in my heritage labor activism and art all came together
4520145 i went up to him and said i wanted to do a documentary
4520146 i took a sabbatical from july to october 2006 when i did the bulk of the editing
4520147 i edited on vacation days and early in the morning and at night
4520148 you start out with a mass of material and you have to carve it down to the essentials so you can communicate to an audience
4520149 im excited to share the story of how these people managed to maintain their culture their politics and their art in a new place

4520153 in earlier centuries religion prescribed a moral code of conduct which was very faithfully followed over the past few years it has gone out of control
4520154 spirituality is inspiring oneself and others on the path of illumination what is sad is that today religion has taken the form of racial and ethnic discrimination xenophobia terrorism and so on
4520155 in both cases the ideology is humane and non violent yet the way it is practised is destructive and aggressive
4520156 there is an inborn perception in people that they are good and the rest are evil and they have to destroy the evil before it overpowers them there is also the element of greed by destroying the other person you get what he has thus making you more powerful
4520157 it is the misuse of religion that is the problem when anyone starts using their religion against me i have nothing more to do with that person
4520158 make your religion better by being a better practitioner of it
4520159 religion is based on faith you arent allowed to question or discuss it and there is no logic or reason behind it what is the difference between faith and stupidity
4520160 we are living in an era of schizophrenia but there are too many people who believe and we cannot call all of them schizophrenic
4520161 having armchair discussions does not constitute religion you need to go out on the field and see
4520162 all the religions in the world claim they can tell you everything but can they tell you how to make a bicycle
4520163 mr wood undeniably shares responsibility for what happened to mr keeran and should be held accountable for his reckless acts but no man ever deserves to die for another mans acts
4520164 this guy his mental capacities are not sufficient to make him a mastermind
4520165 you have an individual that is a user or manipulator of other people and im thinking particularly in terms of where youre planning the robbery for two weeks
4520166 surely you would have thought in terms of using a mask or a disguise where you wouldnt have to kill somebody so this was a deliberate and intentional act in terms of the clerk that was going to be killed
4520167 when the law punishes by death it risks its own sudden descent into brutality transgressing the constitutional commitment to decency and restraint
4520168 that risk will have come to fruition and we all will have taken a descent into brutality unworthy of the state of texas
4520169 mr wood undeniably shares responsibility for what happened to mr keeran and should be held accountable for his reckless acts but no man ever deserves to die for another mans acts
4520170 in tune with public opinion and hes aware that public opinion doesnt support killing someone who has such a diminished role as an accomplice
4520171 jeffs case is so much like kenneths case it is like a mirror image
4520172 i remember thinking last summer that texas had already executed the killer and yet they wanted kenneth it is the same for jeff
4520173 im here because jeff wood is innocent and on death row for a murder that he didnt commit
4520174 the death penalty to me is the easy way out
4520175 if you had to be down there and get up every morning as hot and humid as it is knowing that you are going to spend the rest of your life locked up under those conditions thats punishment thats what i think my son would want for him

4520180 it should not surprise us that democrats headed home without providing relief to high gas prices which are affecting millions of americans the democrats refusal to increase domestic production and exploration has exacerbated the crisis it was claire mccaskill who said a few days ago that its not as bad as it seems when asked about the performance of the 110th congress
4520181 as many americans are struggling with the rising gas prices democrats have decided to head home to work on their tans instead of remaining in washington dc to vote on key energy legislation that could give americans relief from the high cost of fuel yes claire it is as bad as it seems the democrats in congress have failed the american people its sad that claire mccaskill is too busy trying to get barak obama elected and diluting missourians with false promises of progress to do anything about high gas prices
4520182 it is important to start by saying that there is no necessary logical connection between mr kaneshans admitted ability to continue with his employment after the accident and his claim that he was unable to do housekeeping and caregiving for one year afterwards
4520183 i find that it is completely implausible to conclude that mr kaneshan could continue to drive a transport truck full time but that he was unable to occasionally drop his children off at school in my view this is completely nonsensical and i draw the inference from it that mr kaneshan is prepared to exaggerate the level of his disability to suit his needs in this arbitration hearing

4520185 i feel a change in the attitude around energy efficiency the consciousness has changed a great deal we are way behind

4520187 oh i had a gun in my carrying case which was given to me by a marvelous marvelous engraver last year at the telethon of 07 he presented me with this gorgeous gift he presented it to me in the telethon office in 07 i put it in that traveling case and i hadnt traveled since that telethon til that day
4520188 there was a prop gun in lewis baggage besides the handgun that was given to lewis as a gift i did not previously know about the gift and did not know which gun the gift or the prop police confiscated
4520189 if it was a prop then it wouldnt be a weapon now would it
4520190 oh sure i knew about the grenade launcher jerry has had that forever the reason i didnt mention it previously was that it isnt a gun and you had asked me about a gun
4520191 honey what did you get for when you meet jerry lewis
4520192 i got em a gun polished it up real pretty

4520219 christ alone is the mirror in which we can contemplate that which the weakness of the cross hinders from being clearly seen in ourselves when our minds rise to a confident anticipation of righteousness salvation and glory let us learn to turn them to christ we still lie under the power of death but he raised from the dead by heavenly power has the dominion of life we labour under the bondage of sin and surrounded by endless vexations are engaged in a hard warfare 1 tim 1 18 but he sitting at the right hand of the father exercises the highest government in heaven and earth and triumphs gloriously over the enemies whom he has subdued and vanquished we lie here mean and despised but to him has been given a name phil 2 9 which angels and men regard with reverence and devils and wicked men will dread we are pressed down here by the scantiness of all our comforts but he has been appointed by the father to be the sole dispenser of all blessings for these reasons we shall find our advantage in directing our views to christ that in him as in a mirror we may see the glorious treasure of divine grace and the unmeasurable greatness of that power which has not yet been manifested in ourselves

4520269 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4520270 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4520271 they used a john mellencamp song until he made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4520272 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself

4520348 ive gotten a lot of questions the last few weeks asking if obama is the antichrist
4520349 i tell everyone that i dont think the antichrist will come out of politics especially american politics
4520350 i can see by the language he uses why people think he could be the antichrist
4520351 but from my reading of scripture he doesnt meet the criteria there is no indication in the bible that the antichrist will be an american
4520352 and she turned to me and smiled and said yes but she decided to leave it home that night
4520353 and that was that can i give great opening lines or what
4520354 i look at it like im still at the bottom right now because thats the best way for me to go about it
4520355 if youre still on the bottom you know you have a lot to fight for i dont want to get complacent saturday was a great game but i have to put that behind me and look forward to this week
4520356 its kind of tough but youve got to go out there and make the most of your opportunities
4520357 a lot of times you only get that one shot so youve got to take advantage of it the overtime gave a lot of us guys more of an opportunity to show what we can do
4520358 a guy that comes in undrafted he played a season or two in nfl europe now hes having great success if you want it bad enough youll stick at it and do what you have to do to make it
4520359 there going to put the best guys back there for that job my position right now if i have to block for a returner or get down and cover whatever i have to do to make the team im willing to do it
4520360 hes a young guy who has got some quickness and has pretty good vision well just keep continuing to evaluate him
4520361 they keep telling me when im not on a team during the season hey dont give up
4520362 just my family and my friends and a lot of people in my community just say stay at it a lot of times when you want to give up you cant
4520363 its just one of those things if it doesnt work out here for him its working out somewhere else a lot of coaches and players are telling guys that this is the time for young guys to come in and shine and show what youre made of when youre playing in these preseason games you are either make it or break it he could end up staying here or going somewhere else based on what he does in the preseason
4520364 sometimes the most important muscle a football player has is between his ears
4520365 when i met with the doctor they explained everything what i can expect to do
4520366 that was good for me because i could go on with my day
4520367 its something i will probably have to deal with for the rest of the season
4520368 im pretty sure its going to hang around for a little bit
4520369 when im on the field i dont really think about it so its not really an issue
4520370 it was evident their backups did better than ours especially their third team
4520371 win or lose we got out of there pretty healthy
4520372 we didnt have four of our top six receivers but i thought jake operated pretty good for the conditions
4520373 it wasnt ideal as far as the offensive passing game
4520374 i think in those conditions people are going to load up the box and that makes the running game a little tougher to get going
4520375 i think it good for his confidence to get in there
4520376 were still without three out of our four starters in the secondary so hopefully we will start to get those guys back
4520377 the motto for us has to be bend but dont break
4520378 they moved the ball but we stood up when he had to we got put in some tough situations but we came out on top when we had to
4520379 for the most part i thought we came back out after that played pretty solid for about three quarters
4520380 i was trying to keep things in perspective but its weird playing special teams here for three years and being told indirectly thats your role on this team and then having another team say hey weve seen your preseason film of you starting
4520381 its different when youre behind first round picks its tough to get in there and compete
4520382 it was kind of disappointing because i thought it would have been a great opportunity to get in there and jump start my career and show what i can do on the field as a starter and not just a special teams player
4520383 i dont get too many chances to start stuck behind first round picks at middle linebacker since ive been here but i believe in myself and im pretty sure the organization believes in me they put me out there and gave me a start and every time i get out there on the field i think i play well and try to show what i can do and show i can be a starters
4520384 hes played a lot of football for us he actually started a game for us a couple of years ago i thought he did well operating in there in jon beasons absence its unfortunate that jon wasnt in there but that usually opens the door for somebody else and i thought adam managed the game very well
4520385 when i came out i had a bad foot i was projected to go much higher but things didnt work out the fact they drafted me meant a lot that they believed in me
4520386 we kind of joked about that we have 11 linebackers and thought theyll probably draft a linebacker in the first three rounds and sure enough they did
4520387 but you cant fault the panthers for that it was a great value pick hes a great linebacker too he had a great college career and hes learning fast here any time you get a guy like that in the third round id have done the same thing
4520388 its competition it makes people better all i can do is come out every day in practice and games and do the best i can
4520389 it was a good camp it was short but it was sweet
4520390 like always there are always tougher times than others but we worked through it i like the script so far
4520391 you always have a couple of guys that you wish things didnt happen to well leave some guys behind but for the most part we made it through with nothing real severe
4520392 sometimes with those nicks and injuries it gives other people opportunities guys like jason carter chad upshaw we brought him back and hes done some good things
4520393 i like what ive seen i like the way we went about our business now its a matter of staying healthy
4520394 theres that option if we were doing the injury report it would be questionable
4520395 i like the idea of camp there are a lot of teams in the league that dont even go to camp they stay at home i like the idea of going away i think guys are kind of forced to be with each other and in my opinion thats a good thing they take great care of us here from the chow staff to the dorm staff the facilities are great the fields are great ive got no complaints
4520396 they are better off if they stay home and get treatment
4520397 i would have liked for him to have gotten more throws and he would have liked to too but at the end of the day weve got three preseason games left hell get a little more time this week against philadelphia i just didnt want to risk it
4520398 we blocked well i thought we took the next step
4520399 we dont cut block in practice when you get into a game element its a little bit different and i thought we operated pretty well there i liked our pass rush early on with our first unit then i thought there were some spotty things that need work i thought it was a pretty good outing overall for the first time
4520400 hes had some great years there so i dont know that its so much sides
4520401 i think if you asked him hes probably more comfortable because his stance is natural over there i think julius worked very hard this off season and he came ready to play for the most part hes done that i think everybody highlights on that one 2007 season but hes had a lot of good years prior to that
4520402 youve got to get your team fresh not that we wont work but we probably wont bang them quite as hard as we have in the past
4520403 jason and i have spoken its just one of those things that hopefully you learn from and its good that it was in the preseason
4520404 i thought i made some good throws there were one or two there i thought i left on the field and wished we had completed those but i thought i did all right managing the game managing the offense and moving the ball we had two good drives wished we would have punched it in we got six points out if it we just need to execute at the end
4520405 now its kind of down but weve got a great leader in moose and steve they keep preaching get better no matter what happens youve got to get better each day you go out there watching moose go out to practice every day you cant help but cling onto it and try to put that into your game
4520406 i always feel something positive is going to happen i feel like i work hard i feel like the coaches know my work ethic i feel like they know im going to do whatever i can to try to make plays when the ball goes up i feel its my ball its my job to catch it so i feel pretty good about it
4520407 sometimes setbacks and adversity are opportunities for other people it happens in this league all the time with every team and thats the challenge to our team other guys have got to step up as well as other guys have got to take advantage of opportunities
4520408 i tell you man hes doing a lot of good things
4520409 i think its the little things that make the receiver great thats executing certain techniques and routes making sure that your splits and the depths of your routes are right all the time being consistent with that
4520410 but he makes a great job of making plays out there if all else fails and youre making plays you can accept some of the other things that are not going so well as far as learning the nuances of the position from what i see hes definitely on the right track and hes doing well hes a great surprise for us
4520411 oh wow going from outside to inside to slot to other side ive been playing all four positions at the wide receiver spot
4520412 then going to special teams you get drained real quickly
4520413 not doing it for almost a year and a half im kind of rusty back there
4520414 but once i get the ball in my hands i feel like i can make plays im just trying to work on it before and after practice every day catching it and trying to get better at it
4520415 i guess i should have thrown my hand up for a fair catch but i wanted a chance to return it i didnt really care about getting hit or anything like that because its football i should have thrown my hand up and made the smart decision but you live and you learn
4520416 ive worked with them before in practice so im not going to be too excited
4520417 when you go out and play football it doesnt matter if youre with the ones the twos the threes its time to play football
4520418 its like christmas when you open the presents up i dont care how old you are when you get a box under that tree youre always excited to open it up and see whats in it were ready to get home
4520419 its still hard work any camp with john fox as the head coach youre going to work hard
4520420 hes going to get his duty days out of you i think everybody has an appreciation for how he runs his camp all the guys here have tried to utilize the time down here and take advantage of it and work hard and get better not just show up and go through the motions in doing that youre going be tired youre going to be mentally challenged but when you get to the season it makes everything else that much easier
4520421 maybe ive been down here so many times it just makes me sick on my stomach to come down here im just ready to get back to the confines of home see my family at night just the little things that you appreciate when youre down here im eager to get back to one practice a day no matter what
4520422 we want to come out and play well against philly we didnt last year and it showed
4520423 we want to go out and do well but if we dont its not the end of the world these are preseason games we do want to build on it we want to treat it like a stepping stone and we want to become better rather than get worse its going to be a little different game philly is definitely a physical football team to come in and play them early on again is an opportunity to see where we measure up from last year
4520424 i definitely feel like this is going to be best year by far
4520425 i think we should put it in the cba collective bargaining agreement if a preseason game goes to overtime its a tie regardless
4520426 i can run yet so thats not good and i havent been able to do a full revolution on a bicycle yet
4520427 whatever percentage you want to put on that i wouldnt venture to guess
4520428 its unfortunate that weve got a couple of guys down right now but youve still got to play the game of football
4520429 when the chances are given to you youve got to try to cash in on them and take advantage
4520430 i feel like im a kicker as much as john kasay is
4520431 its just that my situation is slightly different because im making my way into the league whereas john has been in the league im biding time
4520432 im tagged as a specialist because of my leg strength and the situation hasnt come up to where im kicking field goals in the league
4520433 but i didnt come into the league as a kickoff specialist i came into the league as a kicker
4520434 i feel like i can kick field goals with the best in the league so its a matter of time thats not saying im going to take over johns job in the next week or two because that is not reality the reality is im here to do a job handling kickoffs
4520435 its a combination of a lot of things but i think what helps is that i was always taught the correct way of striking a soccer ball
4520436 and i work out with a guy down in tampa and i work on a lot of stuff specifically and i have a lot more weight behind the ball than most kickers so that helps im fortunate in that i can wind up and let it go
4520437 it had pretty good hang time but i didnt get it all
4520438 thats a weapon when you can put it out of the end zone and give the other team the ball at the 20
4520439 well evaluate that as we go but hes looked very strong in camp
4520440 i want to do the same thing if not better i want to try to put every kick in the end zone but realistically that might not be possible with weather conditions and whatnot but i would love to keep doing what im doing but i still have a long way to go before final cuts
4520441 its similar to the one i was in at baltimore when i was with matt stover
4520442 here we have a guy like john who is moving on in the years and im sure he will love me for saying that but i think its helping him out too its saving his leg hes one of the best kickers around if its helping out the team thats a good thing
4520443 i just have to bide my time and wait for the right opportunity to come up
4520444 were at the low level right now and its going to take time
4520445 if that means trying to get it right with six seven or eight sports i would rather do that than try to go too wide
4520446 beijing is an indicator of what the gap is between us and our competitors
4520447 we do need to take a look at strategic investments in some of those sports where we could put in 300 000 or 400 000 and get some results
4520448 australia did it all the time in archery for example but we have to have the right information
4520449 if we dont have the expertise in canada then we need to go overseas and get them there but we have to be careful that we dont say were going to pay a coach a huge salary and then not give him the tools to do the job
4520450 ive come from a system where often in the early days so many services were pushed on sport they didnt know which ones were the important ones
4520451 i do believe we shouldnt be here just to participate
4520452 ive never believed in just making the national team and being happy and satisfied with that
4520453 if our athletes are here there should be a realistic chance to get to the podium
4520454 its never time to modify the medal projection until the gun goes at the end of the games
4520455 were not even halfway into the games right now and were a second half team
4520456 theres our bubble as we call it and we try to stay in that as much as we can
4520457 we dont read comments we dont read forums we dont read all the websites nothing like that
4520458 you dont want to get brought down by negativity we all want to be that one to win the first medal because thats pretty awesome but were all doing the best we can
4520459 you cant think about medals because then it throws you off
4520460 you have to think ok what am i going to do that is going to get me to that wall and get me there as fast as i can go
4520461 cant believe i shaved for this i mean what am i even doing here who cares about bob saget
4520462 i dont know you know i guess a few other people turned it down its always how i look at it
4520463 no i really like her shes a really good girlfriend
4520464 you should try that i think thatd be good for you
4520465 ok this is gods will its going ever so smoothly
4520466 its my party and ill cry if i wan to
4520467 michelle can you help me move the rest of the stuff out of the room tomorrow
4520468 you put my crap in the back of the van and i will bs with the neightbor psycho aunt next door i wont even go into detail about that witch one because she doesnt deserve a spot in my story and two because my fingers are getting tired from all of the typing
4520469 we want to come back but only if you meet our previous demand
4520470 i took a tough shot and im a little buzzing right now but its one of those things where you try to make a play and you take a shot
4520471 my head wasnt that bad of a problem at the time but i think i hurt my ribs on that play my head started to hurt more than i thought it would and i kind of pulled myself out after that
4520472 i mean anytime a team gets down there in the red zone we pride ourselves by not giving up touchdowns i just so happened to be the guy this time to be able to step up and make a big hit
4520473 ive always found theres a real turn on to watching and knowing its people you could run into in the grocery store
4520474 there has been a decision there is a first collective agreement for gatineau for the garage
4520475 its not a life or death experience but you should give it a try and see what comes out of it
4520476 its really who we think is good enough for the show
4520477 im proud to be a part of american idol even at this stage
4520478 the moment you slip into this line youre competing against everyone in music
4520479 and they have no idea whats in store its a whirlwind waiting for them
4520480 i can operate my voice to do melismas the ability to sing a variety of notes in a single syllable of a lyric runs and licks
4520481 ive had a passion for singing and i want to inspire a lot of people
4520482 david archuleta is my first true love please just let me be your wife in eternity
4520483 where did this man get these things what is the wisdom given to him how are such mighty works done by his hands 3 is not this the carpenter the son of mary and brother of james and joses and judas and simon and are not his sisters here with us
4520484 5 and he could do no mighty work there except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them 6 and he marveled because of their unbelief

4520493 i think the bills insider does a great job of following the bills they give the most accurate facts and in depth stories that i have found on the internet keep up the great work
4520494 billsinsider com is a great website bills fans are unbelievably rabid and knowledgeable good stuff
4520495 its a well attended game for a preseason game the stadium looks great and the bills organization did a great job with the field it looks first class and it is first class
4520496 its something that weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited
4520497 i think someday people will look back on this like women not having the right to vote and segregation and anything else that seems ridiculous that we dont all have the same rights
4520498 planning a wedding is very stressful its crazy my gardener is now invited

4520501 these rocks date from the carboniferous 325 mya and were layed down
4520502 i suspect that talking about named periods rather than absolute age ranges also helps geologists to handle the disconnect between the lengths of time were discussing when talking about earth history
4520503 with that in mind when you write these geology posts that the non geologist can enjoy could you please use the age instead of the geological name or even better along with
4520504 if you want to bully someone over the fate of sacred crackers donohue pick on someone your own size someone like me

4520506 when a woman develops high blood pressure two separate readings taken at least 4 hours apart of 140 90 or more and 300 mg of protein in a 24 hour urine sample
4520507 i think the big thing is that the cosmetic and beauty industry have really convinced people mainly through media and marketing of their goods that people men included now need products and procedures to make themselves beautiful
4520508 the move to the metrosexual male a few years back built on this in convincing men even heterosexual ones that they need to attend to their physical appearance and this opened up a new market for the cosmetics and beauty producers
4520509 the thing i found was that its amazing how far and wide globally these trends have stretched basically you cant go anywhere where it isnt the westernized and youth obsessed norm of beauty now
4520510 in terms of the u s we have long worshipped youth and the possibilities that attend it
4520511 we have developed a culture around terms of change and growth and each generation is raising its children in a world very different from the one it grew up in new world rather than kids following in their parents footsteps many are encouraged to go farther do more or simply are forced to different career paths because their parents paths are no longer viable we are living longer and as we age we are struggling to remain relevant in a world that doesnt especially value the wisdom of elders all of this must exert some psychological pressure why appear old when age does not accrue respect or benefit
4520512 i have won gold in the world championships many times but i was expecting something really special at the olympics and i got it i am very delighted
4520513 i havent decided whether i will run the 5 000m yet
4520514 im hoping to break the world record but not soon maybe next year if i find the right track
4520515 i had food poisoning on tuesday in our training camp
4520516 it was not pretty for 48 hours the us olympic committee got me back to the hydration levels i needed i didnt know whether my legs would be under me
4520517 my coach said to fall asleep for as many laps as you can and wake up when you feel the finish line
4520518 if i add condo fees property taxes maintenance costs furnishing costs and the opportunity cost of not investing that money and spending it on the house instead
4520519 and then you add in someone elses profit the costs are exactly the same only renting is more expensive
4520520 why do on line banking on wi fi even on a secure network how safe is that
4520521 the culture was shaping catholicism the engines of evangelization were running in reverse
4520522 by instituting a series of policy norms sought to deflect attention from their own appalling failures
4520523 the disk bloat fragmentation and ongoing degradation in performance may be an argument for having some slaves that keep the same data in myisam tables
4520524 inserting in parallel into different tables when indexes fit in memory results in very bad contention causing hundreds of thousands of context switches per second with far less work done than one would hope
4520525 cmon aggregates information from mysql cluster that earlier was only accessible from the cluster log or the management client such as cluster state node state backup statistics statistics cluster events cluster log basically and lets you access the information using sql because cmon logs the information into ordinary myisam tables
4520526 hi my name is larry and i am an oracle dba

4520533 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4520534 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4520535 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4520536 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4520537 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4520538 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4520539 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4520540 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4520541 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4520542 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4520543 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4520544 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4520545 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4520546 it just sounds like another way to get rid of them
4520547 ive heard rumors that all the homeless people are going to be sent away to aurora or somewhere else
4520548 how do you know where you are going if you dont know where you have been
4520549 can i justify this purchase to potato cheap sob that he is at the end of the month on the blog
4520550 without a loved one serving in the military it is sometimes possible for americans to overlook the sacrifices that have been made and continue to be made by members of the armed forces on behalf of our nation
4520551 by once again permitting access to accredited members of the media this legislation would honor those who have given their lives in defense of our nation
4520552 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim
4520553 it just looks like a costume with some fake guys thrown on top for effect
4520554 its not on endangered species on any list that weve got

4520566 unfortunately housing activity continues to worsen job losses continue inflation is rampant credit is more difficult to obtain and firms remain cautious about capital investments
4520567 we think manufacturing will remain in a slow shallow downward trend until early 2009
4520568 without the lifeline from the rest of the world the manufacturing picture would be a lot darker

4520638 yo fui secuestrado por ese comandante jos luis romero el 15 de octubre de 2003
4520639 desde 1999 empezamos a recibir tanta informaci n que logramos perfilar el modus operandi eran los viernes o s bados por la madrugada en tlalpan en una estaci n de metro conocida como general anaya hacia el estadio azteca entonces establecimos una vigilancia como ong para documentar el delito
4520640 en ese tiempo romero ped a rescates que no llegaban ni a 100 000 pesos unos 10 000 d lares ni duraban m s de tres d as ahora cobran en promedio un mill n 500 000 pesos unos 150 000 d lares y tienen una duraci n de un mes
4520641 the intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a package may be copied
4520642 there are a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4520643 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4520644 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4520645 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4520646 these unsubstantiated spate of reports are totally baseless and malicious
4520647 once they issue impeachment proceedings against him and issue a charge sheet then it will become almost inevitable that he will want to answer those charges
4520648 he feels very strongly that a lot of that is being said is not correct
4520649 we have conveyed to them that the coalition is determined for impeachment and if he wants to save himself the best way is for him to quit
4520650 if a person moves to the side we are not in the habit of bothering him this would not be a good attitude if someone is lying on the ground and we go aggressively against him
4520651 a tip of the hat to jon rosen for pointing out a flaw in my
4520652 regarding directions i havent investigated this but have a couple comments you can call the
4520653 i am trying to get fm to pull up a map of directions simply from
4520654 prior to fm9 the web viewer could only display urls not html directly thats why
4520655 i want to be in vegas i need to be in vegas
4520656 this is in your face comedy and an all you can stand laugh fest
4520657 well never see the old entertainment days of las vegas again
4520658 corporate says that every department has to make money so you cant experiment and take chances thats the bottom line todays performers feel that they dont need las vegas to sell records or to be successful what i mean by that is that they dont have to perform a few nights at a hotel they can do a concert and thats enough or they can get paid to make an appearance at an ultra lounge and get just as much publicity
4520659 playing vegas can help an act as long as it is the right venue years ago it meant something to headline a hotel but times have changed playing the house of blues or the pearl helps most of the others places could hurt an act
4520660 weve been doing it for along time and selling it out each weekend
4520661 its certainly an easier production it also gives our patron a choice of how to spend their entertainment dollar especially with the high cost of the production show ticket this way they can afford to see one of our cirque shows and then choose from one of our many other shows
4520662 not easy finding emerging talent newer performers today play it safe by being the opening for a major concert artist so its difficult to find anyone willing to take a chance
4520663 to be fair its a question i cant answer its mind boggling and it sure beats doing risky broadway shows theyre a great marketing tool for hotels theyre the preeminent show producers with the most talented people willing to spend unbelievable amounts of money you cant ask for more
4520664 heads up poker championship about the only poker show that wont ever have a vegas setting is the heartland poker tour and now theres the ultimate blackjack tour with some vegas locales
4520665 inside every empowered woman is a pussycat doll purring and hissing her way out they have that special kind of confidence every woman can understand what that means and live that philosophy every day every woman wants to be sexy and feel sexy its all about a girl who is very confident and loves to get dressed up like a doll not trashy or slutty but somebody who everyday whether walking down the street or going to the store just owns it with attitude and empowerment a pussycat doll gets up on stage and performs with that same confidence that every woman can have with the same feeling and same vibe about owning every day owning your womanhood its easier today for women to seize this empowerment and enjoy it it wasnt so easy in years gone by because they had to hide and cover up their strengths and just show weakness thank goodness times have changed and weve now got that power
4520666 in the pussycat dolls lounge everything is carefully choreographed but in the casino i didnt just want a go go dancer without dance training you can make go go dancing look so much better if you have that training its the same kind of girl but in the pit they have to provide a theatrical performance at the same time as the dancing i am really happy with them theyre energetic appealing and sexy in my wildest dreams i never would have imagined us being part of a casino its so incredible their outfits in the gaming pit pictured above are not exactly the same as in the lounge i designed uniform styled outfits that are just as sexy but somewhat different and now we will be selling merchandise and pcd lingerie inspired by those costumes
4520667 pure already is home to the las vegas pussycat dolls lounge and now this casino is the final part of a dream come true i began the pussycat dolls 12 years ago but only dreamed about opening a casino the last few years you always think something could go wrong and its not going to happen but honestly everything was completely smooth with this venture my partners at caesars and pure were great and i cant believe we are actually here this is such a new chapter in my life and the life of the dolls incidentally our tv show search for the next pussycat doll premieres on tuesday in the tv show we use all our vegas casino fun stuff to tie in with the show a lot of the lingerie will start in the pit and lead to the lounge and then to your own home
4520668 were tackling that competition head on its the same demographic and with a nightclub on the gaming floor weve got them beat these are just beautiful women they are not being suggestive or vulgar we watch that very carefully and dancing up a storm theyre even sexier with their clothes still on the reaction is incredible its far more than we ever expected the energy and excitement is terrific and everybody male and female young and old enjoys and welcomes their special brand of glitz and glamour we had our soft opening back on super bowl weekend and its just gone from strength to strength the numbers are really solid our dealers have great personalities and upbeat positive attitudes its become another must see attraction at caesars this has been such a big success leading up to tonights official celebrity opening that were now going to expand the 9pm 4am hours and start from noon everyday right throughout march madness well then keep the pussycats casino open much longer than we have been
4520669 intentan blanquear su r cord de los derechos humanos y ofrecer al mundo una imagen agradable cuando de hecho detr s de esa fachada se oculta una fea realidad y la situaci n en el t bet es la peor en mucho tiempo

4520671 i promise to get all the paperwork in order well release the silverton from all responsibility and liability and well return to perform the escape i have to do it
4520672 then i have to be able to get my hand outside the exposed bar and pick one lock and then unravel an un known combination of a second lock and then get to the surface without blowing out my eardrums from the pressure
4520673 this has never been done before underwater i have to hold my breath and the steel box which is no larger than an animal luggage box used on airlines gives me absolutely no room for movement
4520674 ive trained myself to hold my breath for up to four minutes underwater but with all the exertion of getting out of the metal cuffs on my hands and feet the air gets used up much faster if i could get out in 30 seconds believe me i would but it takes almost the length of the hold of my breath theres not much room for safety
4520675 houdini did this escape once in a wooden box with no openings he had it lowered into a murky river so nobody could see anything ive been called the 21st century houdini and i wanted my fans to see me inside the box and getting free
4520676 most active users of online entertainment and social networking sites
4520677 different universities run different policies and apply different network management rules to the way they deal with file sharing and p2p software largely dependent on the health of their network and their position on net neutrality
4520678 where a service will cause us bandwidth problems or is clearly illegal they students need to be restricted this is particularly true for gaming tv streaming and other video services if we did not do so the volume of traffic would begin to impede the activities of other areas of the university
4520679 stick to the legal sites and if you are in any doubt about what is legal ask
4520680 the film and music industry are working on new tactics to stem the circulation of illegal copies of their material and are targeting a number of users to warn or prosecute as an example
4520681 i think the bills insider does a great job of following the bills they give the most accurate facts and in depth stories that i have found on the internet keep up the great work
4520682 billsinsider com is a great website bills fans are unbelievably rabid and knowledgeable good stuff
4520683 its a well attended game for a preseason game the stadium looks great and the bills organization did a great job with the field it looks first class and it is first class
4520684 we have spent a large part of the summer getting ready for the new campaign
4520685 con la firma de este acuerdo todas las tropas rusas y cualquier tropa paramilitar e irregular que haya entrado con ellas deben partir inmediatamente
4520686 lo apoyamos decididamente a nombre del pueblo y gobierno de veracruz en sus esfuerzos por combatir la inseguridad para hacer respetar la ley y hacer que la convivencia en el respeto a derecho sea el signo de vida de todos los mexicanos
4520687 se que es una medida entre muchas que hay que tomar pero un viaje de mil millas comienza con un paso me parece que quien secuestra a un menor de edad secuestra a una persona y la mutila no merece salir nunca de la c rcel esa es mi opini n y la sostengo en cualquier terreno
4520688 if you had to pick one thing to make people healthier as they age it would be aerobic exercise
4520689 theres a large train of thought that one of the best ways of dealing with avian influenza is by detection and containment the ability to detect and type the influenza virus immediately is essential in setting up controls as quickly as possible to minimize the spread of any potential pandemic virus
4520690 age adjusted death rates have reached record lows and life expectancy has reached record highs in recent years likely due to a combination of behavior and societal changes as well as improved medical and surgical therapies
4520691 with the rise in life expectancy it becomes necessary to focus on improving the quality of life and functional abilities as people reach older ages regular exercise including running may contribute to improved health among older adults
4520692 our findings of decreased disability in addition to prolonged survival among middle aged and older adults participating in routine physical activities further support recommendations to encourage moderate to vigorous physical activity at all ages increasing healthy lifestyle behaviors may not only improve length and quality of life but also hopefully lead to reduced health care expenditures associated with disability and chronic diseases
4520693 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted toward men with genetically similar odors
4520694 it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pills as odor perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners

4520697 der krieg in georgien stellt eine z sur in den beziehungen zwischen russland und dem westen dar
4520698 erstmals seit dem ende der sowjetunion hat russland seine milit rische macht au erhalb der landesgrenzen eingesetzt
4520699 einen hinweis darauf wie die russische staatsf hrung denkt gab wladimir putin bereits mit seiner beinharten rede auf der vorj hrigen m nchner sicherheitskonferenz
4520700 damals hatte er als pr sident den moskauer anspruch verk ndet auf dem globus anerkannt zu werden und mitzubestimmen ohne sich einzupassen
4520701 auch bundeskanzlerin angela merkel d rfte aufgrund ihrer pers nlichen biografie f r den gewaltbereiten druck aus moskau sensibilisiert sein
4520702 zugleich gilt deutschland in der westlichen gemeinschaft als weicher verhandlungspartner russlands der w hrend der amtszeit von gerhard schr der sogar in plumpe anbiederung niedersank
4520703 in russland ist jedoch ein gro teil der zug nglichen informationen propagandistisch und widerspr chlich
4520704 es zeichnet sich ab dass der kriegswille georgiens zumindest milit rkorrespondenten und kaukasusexperten seit monaten bekannt war
4520705 oder wartete moskau nur darauf die georgischen truppen in die falle laufen zu lassen und dann nach s den vorzudringen
4520706 russische journalisten die in der stadt waren berichten dass die russische 58 armee entgegen aller kriegspropaganda erst am dritten tag zchinwali erreichte viel sp ter als im russischen fernsehen vermeldet zuvor war die stadt weitgehend in georgischer hand

4520716 sometimes it is hard for my teenagers first period to walk in eight oclock their eyes are drooping they are yawning they just look miserable
4520717 i think going to bed at an earlier time you dont want to stay up until midnight one clock watching the olympics
4520718 the first week of school sets the stage for the whole year
4520719 i sat and talked with that student and found out okay he comes to school full time he plays sports and works every evening until 10 well he is an excellent student so he stays up to study so he is going to bed at two oclock
4520720 imagine that seven swedish record companies start a network to embrace new technology and file sharing from the statement on their web site

4520722 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
4520723 russia is so 20th century this century is all about preemptive strikes
4520724 where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4520725 do you guys have any short term memory anything yeah no lets be clear about it you cant just overthrow a government occupy a capital knock over their statues stack their prisoners refer to the horrific levels of civilian casualties as birth pangs of democracy

4520730 at first we couldnt get it up so then another 10 people ran over to help and we got the bus up and the lady out
4520731 the light turned red and i couldnt stop i tried to miss her
4520732 its a terrible poignancy that donnettes sons birthday will now coincide with the day his mother died
4520733 there are a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment

4520742 no one really knew how to make a record when i started
4520743 you simply went into the studio turned on the mike and said play
4520744 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright
4520745 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4520746 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
4520747 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
4520748 among my favourite sessions i feel the things we did together were dynamite
4520749 cant believe i shaved for this i mean what am i even doing here who cares about bob saget
4520750 i dont know you know i guess a few other people turned it down its always how i look at it
4520751 no i really like her shes a really good girlfriend
4520752 you should try that i think thatd be good for you
4520753 i booked this show so natrually i must shelter the bands girlfriends and friends of the bands in addition fuck my wife if she disagrees

4520755 cualquier deportista quiere estar por lo menos una vez en la vida en unos juegos ol mpicos porque es un privilegio que pocos podemos tener estar en la villa ol mpica con los mejores deportistas del mundo es algo que a todos nos gusta poder disfrutar
4520756 hab a trabajado muy duro y exprim mi cuerpo por encima de mis posibilidades aunque me desinfl al final coment el corredor de pinto
4520757 he visto que mi preparaci n para la vuelta a espa a es id nea y que mi mejor a en contra reloj es enorme lo que me da tranquilidad respecto a otros escaladores s lo me falta afinar la puesta a punto pero creo que puedo llegar en muy buenas condiciones a la salida de la vuelta
4520758 desde luego que me gustar a volver y poder triunfar pero es muy dif cil conseguirlo creo que con los a os debo mejorar en la contra reloj y si es as me gustar a volver para luchar por el oro aunque no es un objetivo que me obsesione lo que s s es que si hubiera corrido el tour y lo hubiera terminado bien el resultado en pek n hubiera sido bastante mejor
4520759 lo afronto sobre todo con mucha ilusi n adem s la suerte es que en este equipo no tengo presi n por ganar llego con los deberes hechos todav a soy muy joven y adem s tambi n correr leipheimer que es otro que puede luchar por la general con garant as y casi seguro que tambi n vendr andreas kloden que tiene calidad de sobra para ser otro candidato el objetivo es que gane el astana y para eso tenemos tres bazas muy s lidas
4520760 la carretera dir qu opci n es la m s adecuada astana quiere ganar y es una gran suerte tener a estos dos compa eros conmigo porque as podremos doblegar incluso a rivales que est n m s fuertes
4520761 es una vuelta para escaladores aunque tampoco es mala para gente que vaya bien contra reloj y se defienda en monta a
4520762 creo que habr que esperar hasta el final para saber el ganador pero el primer test ser la primera contra reloj luego en las etapas de pirineos se comprobar el estado de forma con que ha venido cada uno y tras este primer lote de monta a lo fundamental ser n las etapas de asturias el angliru y fuentes de invierno el que salga l der de ah va a tener gran parte de la vuelta ganada

4520765 in the days before april 18 revere had instructed robert newman the sexton of the old north church to send a signal by lantern to colonists in charlestown as to the movements of the troops when the information became known one lantern in the steeple would signal the armys choice of the land route while two lanterns would signal the route
4520766 the a doctor who happened to be in lexington returning from a lady friends house at the awkward hour of 1 a m revere dawes and prescott were detained by british troops in lincoln at a roadblock on the way to nearby concord prescott jumped his horse over a wall and escaped into the woods dawes also escaped though soon after he fell off his horse and did not complete the ride revere was detained and questioned and then escorted at gunpoint by three british officers back toward lexington
4520767 if the british march by land or sea from the town to night hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch of the north church tower as a signal light one if by land and two if by sea and i on the opposite shore will be ready to ride and spread the alarm through every middlesex village and farm for the country folk to be up and to arm

4520782 monsantos own blistering 1994 arguments against the patent were ultimately key in defeating it

4520835 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4520836 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected

4520847 craze of setting fire to wheelie bins and sniffing the fumes to get a high
4520848 they were actually setting fire to the bins and the fumes that were coming off the bins they were inhaling
4520849 they were getting some sort of hallucinogenic effect i think basically the effect they were having was the oxygen starved from the brains
4520850 refused to take a householders wheelie bin away because it was more than one stride away from the kerbside
4520851 but ought it to the answer is a fairly clear no

4520863 i ask that everyone keep the curry family in your prayers also we would ask that the officers of city of gulfport be kept in your prayers and your thoughts mournful consideration given to them

4520874 orchestras finding ways to be of relevance to people who may never come to a subscription concert the truth is that if symphony orchestras only matter to people who attend their subscription concerts they will truly become extinct if orchestras are seen as true community resources each serving its particular community in unique ways suited specifically to that community they become significantly more important and meaningful

4520885 since deng xiaoping gained power in the late 1970s and liberalized the economy china has been transformed almost beyond belief its economy has expanded tenfold no country in history has ever lifted so many people out of poverty so rapidly what was once a vast prison camp has conceded a great deal of personal freedom to ordinary people they can work and live where they choose they can travel and study abroad they have access to the internet there is a growing sense among the chinese that they are entitled to certain basic human rights a startling development in a country where for centuries individual rights have been an alien concept
4520886 a market economy cant function without substantial freedom from state control as countries become richer and more educated they unleash forces that are incompatible with authoritarian rule
4520887 instead of lecturing china where i have no doubt there are problems as there are everywhere i would suggest that we turn our attention to the very real threats in the united states where our civil liberties and human rights are being eroded on a steady basis

4520923 these startling figures show that the government is building a national dna database by stealth
4520924 there can be no excuse for storing the dna of innocent adults let alone children who are entirely blameless
4520925 this is an intrusive policy that gives far too much sensitive information to the state when we know that ministers cannot be trusted with its security
4520926 the dna that should be on the database is that of past offenders yet when it comes to them there are major gaps in the database
4520927 this is yet more evidence that the dna database is totally arbitrary with tens of thousands of innocent kids on it but not every offender in our prisons
4520928 this is why we need to have a parliamentary debate on the issue and to put this database on to a statutory basis
4520929 potentially inconsistent and discriminatory and contrary to an individuals privacy rights

4520944 many of the participants in this event view it as an opportunity to validate themselves as grapplers in particular despite the fact that they are already established their reputations in mma in general
4520945 it has been interesting observing mma fighters from different systems as they embraced grappling a significant number of our fighters come to mma with an opinion that their particular form is superior to another but quickly learned two things 1 no one system is better than another the preparation and heart of the fighter are most crucial to success but 2 in order to succeed in mma all fighters will invariably find themselves on the floor and the fighter best proficient in grappling will probably prevail

4520999 florian merkels pictorial compositions depict persons in various action and behavior patterns that can be related to social realities and psychic or emotional sensibilities the designs are based on photographs that are linearly traced the photographic basis guarantees the figures individual concreteness and their motion sequences merkel accentuates the physical sensuality and the vital energy of the actors figures in lightning colors roam through his pictorial cosmos they explode the boundaries of the image through their voluminous corporeality and their expansive movements in order to passionately and energetically push forward into the space by means of glances and gestures they encourage each other to partake in dramatic situations and rituals that come to a head and even to find an attitude in this scenic play tensions hierarchies and conflicts are played out by means of paralingual gesticulations through his pictures or figures he transforms the viewers space into an experimental laboratory for communicative strategies and human manners florian merkel visualizes in this way aspects of our social reality in a concentrated form
4521000 florian merkel studied photography at the famous art academy in leipzig however in recent years merkel has started to search for new ways of creating pictures with digital media he still uses photographs as the starting point and he still brings in his knowledge of color and composition in his new digital work merkel manages to create simple pictures that are multi levelled and complex at the same time he transforms body movements or figures in social situations to symbolic patterns furthermore the viewer can sense merkels origins as a photographer in the way that he masters depth of field the structuring of the surface and the precise setting of light and colors

4521029 were going to have our hands full friday in both games but when you put two in the bank it sets you up for some possibilities
4521030 we have still lots of pitching left and our bats are coming around all we need to do now is to shore up the defensive end of things and we should be ready to battle
4521031 it was mainly defensive errors that got us into trouble
4521032 this music is sure to fill listeners with the spirit of the holidays
4521033 everyone can enjoy the concert friday night and then come back to hear the entire choir perform saturday and help light the luminarias
4521034 weve played a lot of games in a row and weve been hitting the ball in every game
4521035 theyre a good hitting team and any time they get a few guys on base they seem to get the hits that they need at the right times
4521036 we had a couple of untimely errors that hurt us too
4521037 we know what we have to do now we just have to play good ball and the pressure is on them
4521038 theres a reason theyve won so many championships theyre not going to lay down thats for sure
4521039 all playoffs weve just been hitting singles and doubles i dont know how many home runs we have but its not many
4521040 blake kept his ball low kept it away from them and got lots of ground outs
4521041 hes effective if he throws that way and we played good defence behind him
4521042 i think its tough for them to see blakes off speed stuff and change ups and then x comes in and mows them down with his speed its a good combination
4521043 were hitting the ball pretty well and the pitching is ok
4521044 weve made enough errors for both teams so far this series
4521045 they are the defending canadian champions and weve beaten b c three out of the last four times
4521046 if we play hard like this against everybody we can win we played hard wednesday too its just a matter of executing and of course getting the kind of pitching marshall dean gave us
4521047 its a tough pool but its a good pool to be in
4521048 it brings out the best in everybody you cannot take a day off against these teams in the pool that were in

4521070 its in our criminal justice system that everyone is innocent until theyre proven guilty but in all reality until you actually are proven your innocence you carry the scarlet letter of the accused

4521100 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4521101 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4521102 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4521103 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4521115 no one really knew how to make a record when i started
4521116 you simply went into the studio turned on the mike and said play
4521117 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright
4521118 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4521119 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
4521120 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
4521121 among my favorite sessions i feel the things we did together were dynamite
4521122 i talked to john edwards and hes not doing well

4521135 strong dollar is in the best interest of the united states
4521136 the u s believes in a strong dollar policy but wants the chinese to allow their currency to get stronger versus the dollar
4521137 you know there has been a change in perception of gold it is now being traded as an offset to the dollar and not the store of value or inflation hedge that it was being traded as
4521138 a return to the underlying fundamentals for the dollar should bring about a bounce in gold but when we see that bounce is unknown
4521139 while the united states may be in greater trouble than the markets realize china may be in less in other words the slump in the west may not be so soft in the east it may not be in a slump at all
4521140 retail sales in the united states are falling but sales in china are going up at 23 per year even after inflation theyre going up at 15 the fastest pace in 9 years sales of gasoline are increasing at a 55 annual rate
4521141 incomes are rising too real after inflation incomes are going up at an 8 annual rate
4521142 in other words maybe china is not slowing down very much after all

4521158 our most urgent task today is the immediate and orderly withdrawal of russian armed forces and the return of those forces to russia
4521159 we need to do our utmost to deter such behavior in the future
4521160 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4521161 we would not like of course to see relations deteriorate in the long or short term we have always based our position on full fledged development of relations with the eu separate eu states the united states and other states
4521162 if someone continues to attack our citizens our peacekeepers we will of course respond in just the same way we have responded there should be no doubt about this

4521173 youd like to see an organization dedicated to the freedom of creative expression right here in town come forth
4521174 from our standpoint it had many hours of broadcast time so it was exposed its not like it was stifled and no one heard it

4521209 the chinese economy isnt going to suddenly grind to a halt when the olympic flame is snuffed out
4521210 in fact i believe the olympics are chinas springboard to even more impressive growth with the nation of 1 3 billion at center stage look for the world to fall even more in love with the opportunity
4521211 still not convinced then ask yourself this simple question would global giants like yum brands mcdonalds and nike among countless others invest so heavily in a country whose growth could potentially dry up overnight absolutely not
4521212 in fact roughly 450 companies recently told the american chamber of commerce in beijing that china was among their top three global investment priorities many regard china as their top priority and you can bet the conclusions were based on mountains of favorable data
4521213 as incomes started to rise the chinese consumer started well buying first it was refrigerators then televisions then air conditioners and now its cars so the next logical purchase in the natural progression is real estate
4521214 to play the imminent boom go with the century 21 of china e house its chinas largest real estate agency services firm with 1 800 professionals in more than 20 cities
4521215 most important to us however is that its grossly undervalued in october shares traded for an eye popping price to earnings ratio of 91 today e house trades for less than 19 times historical earnings and roughly nine times forward earnings
4521216 thats a steal considering earnings should rise by 50 or more for the next five years indeed not too many opportunities come along to buy growth this cheaply
4521217 e house has been battling the misperception of getting lumped together with the withering u s real estate market
4521218 however a recent proposal by the chinese government to levy a new tax based on property values rather than just on transactions as it does now is the real culprit behind the decline
4521219 while the chinese government wants to cool excessive speculation there is no way that it will do anything to deepen the slide of its stock market im not the only person who feels that way the ceo of e house is buying back shares on the open market
4521220 and get this e house has a peg price earnings to growth ratio of only 0 32 any peg below 1 0 means that you are getting a ton of profits for peanuts
4521221 we are going to use this opportunity to average down and lower our cost basis in one of our holdings e house china holdings ltd
4521222 e house is chinas largest real estate company its been an extremely volatile stock since going public just about a year ago
4521223 it hit a high of 36 45 on 10 31 07 and has been as low as 9 40 the company is supposed to earn 0 82 per share this year and 1 11 per share next year they are growing extremely fast and the stock is cheap
4521224 we are switching our strategy in this stock from a buy and hold to strategic trading we will use the volatility to our advantage if the stock runs up very fast in a short amount of time we will keep a tighter stop underneath it
4521225 compassion when i was at the wharton school of business id watch him every night how could this happen

4521227 i dont know what we can do at intel to implore our partners in the software player companies to get this done implement opm but we need them to implement a fix for this issue asap i know we must be engaged with them on this i just dont see why its not implemented yet its been at least three months and its making us not them look bad in the marketplace

4521234 no one really knew how to make a record when i started
4521235 you simply went into the studio turned on the mike and said play
4521236 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright
4521237 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4521238 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
4521239 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
4521240 among my favorite sessions i feel the things we did together were dynamite
4521241 ive spoken all week about how much ive enjoyed the olympic experience how much i love the spirit of it
4521242 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4521243 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself
4521244 fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4521245 i mean its just one point there is an umpire if im 100 percent sure about it i mean i will give it but im not sure
4521246 whatever is going to get him to have some sleep tonight then thats fine
4521247 it was really one or two points and who played those one or two points better
4521248 im happy because the worst thing that can happen is im going to have all the medals

4521269 the states export performance continues to be extremely strong but we need to be realistic in looking into the future as much of the world economy has been slowing down
4521270 the export increases we have witnessed are being driven largely by the high oil and agricultural prices as well as the weakness of the u s dollar in recent years
4521271 despite the global economic slowdown there are excellent target opportunities for many louisiana companies in both exporting and importing especially in selected developing countries such as china india brazil panama and south africa

4521273 three new polls released today show significant movement toward john mccain
4521274 a similar pattern manifests itself in minnesota where rasmussen has barack obamas lead eroding to 4 points obama had held a 13 point lead last month and in the critical swing state of colorado rasmussen has john mccain edging into a 1 point lead last month it had been obama by 3
4521275 no overwhelmingly strong hints about whats going in from the cross tabular results but it appears that mccain has gained ground with independents as is almost always the case when the polls move and also that some republican voters are moving from undecided to mccain

4521342 naturally we d all like some more money who wouldn t but when you look at the market competitiveness of what we offer vs other public service employers as a general rule there is nothing like the disparity there was in executive pay there are a couple of areas where there is a gap like sheriffs and corrections staff although they are not out of step to the same degree as executive levels but in most cases the bc public service offers pay levels competitive with other public services that doesn t mean we will always be competitive with the private sector as well although in many cases we do well on that scale too

4521407 steven davis is a player we have been interested in and hopefully we can do something there but we just have to wait and see
4521408 since the end of last season we have been trying hard to bring in some players who we feel will improve positions which need improved so it has been an ongoing thing
4521409 its always a slow process in the sense that most clubs wait until nearer the end of the transfer deadline
4521410 weve been in negotiations with a number of clubs and lost out on a number of players so we continue to try to get players in who we think will improve us
4521411 weve got one or two signings we would like to make before the deadline so hopefully we have a couple more before we are finished

4521424 id be willing to lose a few hours sleep with you
4521425 this has come out of a little bit of communication with the media about how animals fare in this current climate and recession
4521426 for a lot of people it is becoming harder and harder for them to manage their animals one thing we can do is drop around dog or cat food
4521427 it also gives the older people a visitor once a week which is a good thing
4521428 for both of us its been public humiliation it hurts a big deal
4521429 brown skinned pacific islander from cannons creek a mini me of jake the muss
4521430 i dont have an anger problem im a very rational person im the female im the victim i just think they got the wrong person

4521432 for an elected councillor to find myself in the predicament im in i know that my colleagues are hurting

4521439 i know theres been a change in the coaching style and the up front nature that he de villiers has
4521440 whether thats one of his strategies to try to create an attitude that we the all blacks are not as good as people think im not too sure
4521441 they have always been massive contests and there have never been any easy ones whether thats slipped a bit i cant answer that i dont know
4521442 im not like your fella who likes to talk about the other team all the time i only have a sense for my team and what they are trying to do
4521443 weve had a good week done a lot of homework worked hard and the players are now preparing themselves mentally to be where they need to be
4521444 whatever they do is up to them but they have the responsibility to get there
4521445 the biggest challenge is sunday monday tuesday and the amount of preparation work
4521446 they are important days for getting the strategy right to get it across well to not overload the players thats the biggest challenge weekly getting those days right and setting it up so the players can enter this period in the right space so they can get it right and unleash at newlands
4521447 i think it is a step up its a challenge to us to reach the level we did in auckland and surpass it there are a lot of doubters around who doubt the team has the heart to do it again but thats the challenge to take that level and intensity offshore and put it on the field at newlands
4521448 a population pyramid looks increasingly heavy at the top end
4521449 what were seeing is the baby boomers who were born in the 1950s and early 60s coming through to the older ages and thats the big bulge in the older population coming through now
4521450 weve talked about how our cities are laid out in terms of our footpaths and things like that
4521451 were now dealing with a different looking population that may require different things widening footpaths for the trolleys and making it easier for people to cross the roads those sorts of things
4521452 theres a lot of focus on the burden but there is also a lot of opportunities
4521453 yes there will be more people retiring but a lot of those people will work for longer were certainly seeing higher labour force participation in the older ages hopefully thats people enjoying work longer

4521461 its a huge situation for me after 35 years because ive wanted to bring one back
4521462 this whole thing unfolded about two weeks ago when these two boys came on a talk show here in the states and announced theyd found a bigfoot body
4521463 the commentator asked them if they could send someone to see the body and they said the only person we would allow to come down and verify the body is the real bigfoot hunter tom biscardi
4521464 they showed me the body they took me to the area where they found it it took a day and a half to get there
4521465 i got to be honest when i first saw it i hated to see it in that state it was in i wanted to capture one so the world could see it walking i guess this is the next best thing for the time being
4521466 we trekked in for a day a half what kind of lunatic would be out here in a monkey suit i saw the thing i touched it
4521467 theyre fine guys one works for the police department in georgia and the other was a correctional officer theyre pretty credible guys
4521468 well release the dna analysis and well have the body right next to the two boys then you can see its real that its not all bullshit
4521469 as long as his part time business doesnt affect his work ethic
4521470 his claims of finding bigfoot is entirely a different matter unfortunately thats spilling over into his police life and thats where we have concerns when he comes back from medical leave well have to sit down and address those issues
4521471 ah the andrea blockage sorry to hear that the creative juices have ceased to flow and a danged beaver has dammed the rushing waters of positive thought
4521472 like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of

4521514 he shrugged his shoulders like im tired and i said i know youre tired later on that night it took a turn for the worse

4521521 it is important to note that the new estimates do not show an increase in new hiv infections the new estimates are from the first national surveillance system of its kind in the world that is based on direct measurement of new hiv infections using technology that can distinguish recent from long standing population based infections using the new surveillance system cdc estimates that 56 300 new hiv infections occurred in the united states in 2006 cdc previously estimated that approximately 40 000 new hiv infections occurred annually since the 1990s the 2006 incidence estimate is about 40 higher than the previous estimates the new system reveals that the epidemic is and has been worse than previously estimated and underscores the need to expand hiv prevention to reach those at greatest risk
4521522 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4521523 you are dealing with a people who despise anyting human
4521524 we need to do our utmost to deter such behavior in the future
4521525 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4521526 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4521527 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected

4521534 i want to be a fill in the blank when i grow up
4521535 first there is a trend in prescription drug cost growth generally prices tend to increase because of price increases for existing drugs the growth in the average number of prescriptions per person and the introduction of new drugs
4521536 second the 2008 premiums were calculated as part of a demonstration project that has now expired this project resulted in premiums being 50 cents less in 2008 than had been projected
4521537 third drug distributors participating in part d have found coverage for catastrophic care to be higher than expected
4521538 so they have adjusted their 2009 bids to reflect those higher than anticipated costs

4521541 i dont often use profanity in my postings my wife frowns upon it and my pastor may read my blog on occasion but calling the response of the army in the case of pfc lavena johnson b t is fully justified and was my first visceral response after listening to the npr tell me more interview with her father recently for her story you can view the featured video top of blog right and the npr interview is even more powerful advocacy efforts on behalf of lavena and her family are growing in momentum and volume a vile injustice has been done and there should be an accounting any reasonable person reviewing the facts will agree so the issue is really what can we do to raise the volume on this even further how do we make an effective demand for accountability in this case the army is stonewalling the family but they are accountable to congress legislators in congress can ask questions of the army and of sec of defense gates but they wont know to ask unless we tell them to over 3 000 people have signed on to just one of the petitions being circulated on lavenas behalf and its sic not the only petition making the rounds
4521542 if every one of those 3 000 and more also contacted the legislator in their respective districts that would be a lot of contacts to elected officials on this case and if people kept doing that repeatedly it would have an impact if this makes you angry it should take action do something what can we do to keep putting on the pressure i urge people to contact their own legislator in the house and the senate by phone and email or even a personal visit and ask them to do the following request cong waxman call hearings his committee has jurisdiction contact sec of defense gates and ask him to demand accountability from the army in this case make a public statement of concern and outrage and a public request that this case be properly investigated assess the results then repeat and get as many people as you can to do the same until they do something about it because this is b t and it should not be allowed to stand
4521543 almost all my close friends and family members are liberal this is probably because i was myself quite a liberal for many years and nowadays i tend to move in so called creative circles there arent a lot of impassioned conservatives in the creative writing community or the advertising community what this means is that at any given gathering im one of the only people in the room who has not decided that john mccains election would mean the end of civilization as we know it and that barack obamas election would turn back the tides and heal the earth i exaggerate most of the obama supporters i know are very realistic about the mans potential and capabilities and thats the problem its hard not to fall in line with your very reasonable friends and family now as anyone whos read me for any amount of time knows im comfortable being an out of step political type im not going to sign on to anything just because everyone else is doing it but with the recent debate about the power of endorsements ive realized that the most powerful endorsements are the ones made by those closest to us
4521544 i will ultimately vote with my mind because frankly im hard headed but i wonder do many of you find yourselves drifting one way or another based of the opinions of your closest friends and family do you ever think youve been lulled into supporting a position or a candidate because youre just going with the flow and since i know most of you blog readers are as hard headed as i am let me also ask do you ever suspect your friends and family are just falling into agreement because thats the easy thing to do
4521545 i try to find a more natural view with less traces of humanity where you can really see the beauty of nature
4521546 even though the technology has changed id like to think my style hasnt changed
4521547 the central theme of my work with landscapes hasnt changed
4521548 it has more abstractness than color it makes the viewer aware that they are looking at someones interpretation rather than a quick view of a subject
4521549 with color you get too obsessed with the subject you dont see the creativity the artist has brought into play in black and white you can photograph things you see every day but with good lighting transform it into something really neat
4521550 i loved it so much i didnt want to ruin it for myself if i had to depend on it for a living
4521551 my work is so left brain this is the right side trying to get out its a balancing of myself

4521567 the block copolymer lattice is sort of fooled by these pillars and forms its array around them they form a nice ordered pattern around the pillars
4521568 by properly choosing the spatial distribution of the pillars to match a desired final structure it was possible to consistently generate defect free polymer nanostructures
4521569 nature allows you to get these really well ordered structures without doing much work

4521589 it has become clear that without a compromise on some increased sensible offshore drilling we will not be able to move forward on ideas that will make us truly energy independent

4521815 how they have weathered the changes in patterns of commerce in downtown or in the community

4521824 real estate agents are not alike you can fire me anytime but you wont want to

4521999 these unsubstantiated spate of reports are totally baseless and malicious
4522000 once they issue impeachment proceedings against him and issue a charge sheet then it will become almost inevitable that he will want to answer those charges
4522001 he feels very strongly that a lot of that is being said is not correct

4522012 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field
4522013 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve

4522015 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry

4522063 this is an opportunity for our children to have an improved school experience
4522064 i remember during a visit here not too long ago when four moms grabbed my arm and said let me show you the high school and made me tour it
4522065 i was really sad thats where the students of monroe county go to school
4522066 thats why i was thrilled to secure support for an amendment to house bill 562 this terms capital bill that allows certain school districts to use an alternative formula to determine the percentage of their local share for school construction projects
4522067 only school districts that experience extreme property value reductions in the previous two years would be eligible to use this alternative formula
4522068 the total taxable property value in monroe county has decreased significantly lately due to the decreasing taxable value of ormet
4522069 however the five year window means the local share is not immediately reduced that changes with the amendment in house bill 562 it directs the ohio department of education to prepare an alternative equity list ranking ohios 612 school districts based on fiscal year 2008s taxable valuation per pupil
4522070 the district must still pass a bond levy to secure state funds for new buildings but that levy will be much smaller than it would without this legislation
4522071 i believe the conditions of the buildings in the district are so deplorable that we cant afford to wait for other options with the support of the school board and the community i believe that new schools will be built in monroe county in the very near future
4522072 something pretty significant exploded south and west of goderich and kincardine
4522073 people need to think about how they will be able to bankroll their bills when they are out on disability

4522079 many families including my own have decided that theyre unhappy with the traditional hospital birth experience and find that midwives give them a better experience for low risk births
4522080 citizens for midwifery offers a chart ideals vs reality in u s births which compares the who recommendations cims recommendations and u s reality as of 2004 so thats my highlight of information that could help a mother and her partner choose the kind of care provider and birth setting that will work the best for them as well as information on interviewing choosing a specific provider and setting

4522091 steven davis is a player we have been interested in and hopefully we can do something there but we just have to wait and see
4522092 since the end of last season we have been trying hard to bring in some players who we feel will improve positions which need improved so it has been an ongoing thing
4522093 its always a slow process in the sense that most clubs wait until nearer the end of the transfer deadline
4522094 weve been in negotiations with a number of clubs and lost out on a number of players so we continue to try to get players in who we think will improve us
4522095 weve got one or two signings we would like to make before the deadline so hopefully we have a couple more before we are finished

4522106 i didnt know anything about him which made things worse i didnt know if he was capable of causing harm or turning up at the house
4522107 i was very upset i was on paternity leave for our first baby
4522108 it was an emotional and happy time but to see something so personal on the web was very intimidating
4522109 having your first baby is supposed to be the most treasured thing in the world but seeing that choked me
4522110 you can write on websites because it is freedom of speech
4522111 of the way dc lloyd had spoken to me and i knew from the past what it is like to have an abusive father and it is not very nice
4522112 since he wasnt aware of his actions and was manipulated into destroying an entire species should he be punished or locked up to ensure that no one else can aim the gun that is ender at someone else

4522141 further heavy rain wouldnt be welcome were trying to manage the flows as best we can through the upper middle and lower catchment

4522264 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4522265 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4522266 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4522267 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4522268 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4522269 my eyesight is getting worse by the day but barnet pct has totally ignored my application for treatment i live on my own but i might be forced into a care home if i dont get treatment i am sick with worry that barnet is letting me go blind and i will never see my grandchildren again
4522270 barnet pct is putting mr mulvie into an appalling situation by forcing him to choose between spending his life savings on treatment and going blind rnib is committed to eliminating avoidable sight loss thats why we are backing all wet amd patients in barnet to get sight saving treatment immediately and without question
4522271 barnet pct has previously said that it will not fund because they cannot cap the costs of treatment the warwickshire agreement means that argument is no longer valid it should change its cruel and heartless policy now
4522272 in 18 years of taking part in debates i have never seen an incident like this one
4522273 wild and manic and surging with energy and sometimes mad as a loon but rightly so given the dirty borough cops storyline and it really left me open mouthed at times if youre a distributor you dont yank movies like this you need to show some moxie and push them as best you can because quality wills out damn it and demands a day in the sun
4522274 a huge industrial power going in and crushing a small agrarian nation
4522275 quon ne peut croire tout ce que dit la chine
4522276 we hit a glass ceiling in terms of our advertising it was just not getting any better
4522277 so it may be the end of the online site as well
4522278 one should never forget that these are the values that make us strong and hold our country together we may still have a long way to go to eradicate poverty disease and illiteracy but other countries respect us because of these values
4522279 it is when we work hard that we will realize our full potential and strength
4522280 i have no doubt that india will progress our national wealth will increase and the economic and social conditions of our people will improve
4522281 to improve the economic status and empowerment of women there is no better route than that of cooperatives and self help groups
4522282 these initiatives need to be linked integrated and strengthened to generate a nationwide movement for the empowerment of women
4522283 barring further volatility in crude oil prices it is likely the declining trend in inflation will continue as the country enters the harvest season
4522284 this will be my last match i wanted to take gold so i consider this olympics a failure
4522285 the primary contributing factor to the recent decline in revenues is the loss of our largest credit card processing merchant in the second quarter of this year
4522286 the loss of this customer was mitigated by acquiring 27 new merchant accounts during the second quarter bringing our total number of merchant accounts to 363 at june 30 2008
4522287 the flights could not operate if these strikes go ahead it would effectively shut down the airlines operations
4522288 the airlines and swissport will attempt to draft in management and where possible use non unionised workers there will be a risk of delays and this is worst time of year for it to happen at the peak of the summer season when flights are their fullest
4522289 our members are already struggling to keep up with rising food and energy costs this pay offer is an insult to professional hard working men and women who have to operate in extremely difficult conditions our members have had enough
4522290 this strike is totally unjustified union chiefs should be grateful that they are getting any increase at all at a challenging time for the global economy
4522291 after solving the stonecutter and rune puzzles last night only to find out that my long desired first
4522292 while not unintelligent i do not know how to decompile a program for clues and have not memorized the collected works of william shakespeare complete with line and verse numbering these will be vital skills to solving key puzzles anything i know how to do will be useless when it comes to puzzle solving
4522293 i hereby acknowledge that i am a tourist and wanderer and that lsl and python will forever be beyond my grasp i will never learn the logic of code because my mind doesnt work that way whenever i drop a pre written texture rotate script into a prim it will always rotate in the wrong direction no matter how simple the explanation for how to get it to turn the other way
4522294 i heard this rumor from a journalist at a press conference during comic con i think billy bob is a terrific actor ive been a fan since evening shade
4522295 bathed in light so lusciously golden and honeyed that you might be tempted to lick the screen

4522298 throughout the night and as we post this update our distribution centers are processing customer orders and getting them into the mail
4522299 as a result millions of our members will receive dvds on saturday in time for some weekend movie enjoyment
4522300 rest assured that we are taking aggressive steps to fully understand the root cause of this weeks problems and safeguard against issues like these in the future

4522302 there were some hopeful signs in last quarters survey suggesting that the economy might be bottoming out but weakness persists across the board the fact that firms continue to reduce planned growth in capital investment staff development and employment is particularly troubling since it suggests that slowdown could have longer term implications
4522303 its a classic case of bad timing but in our great lawrenceville tradition we are moving forward with great speed and care
4522304 our search committees have been activated to identify ideal applicants who will help take lawrenceville to the next level and our fiscal strength and stability will allow us to hire talented individuals

4522311 the giants are not a good team they went on a good run and now they lost strahan shockey wilson mitchell mark my words they finish last in this division

4522315 were stepping in with an innovative financing solution that will solve the cash flow problems suffered by the states loan agency and relieve any anxiety students have about their loans
4522316 college students shouldnt have to worry about the ups and downs of the national credit industry as they attend school to pursue their dreams and develop their careers
4522317 with this influx of funds we are confident that every student who needs a loan will receive one
4522318 my one great talent lies in making those who wrong me suffer horribly
4522319 voor de revolutie in 1979 kwamen hier ontzettend veel toeristen het park was de hele dag tot s avonds laat open en op de rand van de fontein zat het vol met buitenlanders kijk nu het is leeg de mensen durven niet meer naar iran te komen doordat hen wordt wijsgemaakt dat wij terroristen zijn maar wie is de werkelijke terrorist in deze wereld het is de amerikaanse regering zij zitten ten westen van ons in irak en ten oosten in afghanistan ze proberen ons onder hun invloed te krijgen en omdat wij sinds de val van de shah niet langer naar hun pijpen dansen maken ze ons het leven zuur
4522320 als jullie zouden weten hoe amerika zich gedraagt hoe arrogant ze zijn dan kun je niet anders dan ze haten zij geven niet om de levens van mensen onze moeders doen hun best om ons op te voeden en groot te brengen maar zij gooien zonder problemen een bom op een bruiloft
4522321 er was vandaag geen stroomuitval en de mensen klagen toch dat we ons niet aan ons rooster houden
4522322 letter to a new president commonsense lessons for our next leader
4522323 i have never been shy about expressing my view that our biographies help establish who we are my own childhood in wolf creek hollow among hardworking coal miners and their families shaped the man i am today rice as a young girl was a concert pianist and it seems the instructions she was given remain with her today infusing her every public appearance sit with your back straight and when the time is right always give them your most dazzling smile even if you have just gotten your hands crossed and want nothing more than to crawl under the piano
4522324 it sounds almost quaint to point it out now but for most of the history of the presidential news conference the questions were not screened ahead of time the way they were for george w bush this president knew what questions were coming and had a neatly arranged list that told him exactly which reporter to call on at exactly which point in the press conference bush even joked about it at times as if there were anything funny about gaming the system and cheating the people of their basic rights to have an accountable president reporters of an earlier generation would never have stood for that there was deep seated respect among the people of the press but under bush it was accepted as a given and if reporters tried to buck the new rules and ask a question other than what was expected then they would not be asked back
4522325 ups drivers ten things women wish men knew about money
4522326 hes played a lot of live football im looking past practice and looking at when he was called during pregame against miami a rival and hes the big east player of the week i know what he can do in a game like situation
4522327 obviously ben made great plays on the perimeter he was not the consummate pocket passer but he was really savvy in terms of protecting himself he had a lot of leadership qualities that dustin can bring to the table now its dustins turn to go have the year that ben mauk had
4522328 college football is high level and you have to keep competition and keep people pushing themselves at all times having more guys here is competition and it pushes us to a higher level than we even thought i had that before when they brought in nick davila youre going to have competition there thats part of what makes teams better
4522329 when youre the no 1 its implicit that youd better go out and get the job done or youre not going to be the no 1
4522330 i dont think he could have held onto the position unless he had a level of confidence in his ability to get the job done im not going to put a guy out there who doesnt believe he can get the job done
4522331 despite being a model student athlete and person for the ncaa and despite having earned the ncaa significant revenues the ncaa has wrongfully arbitrarily and capriciously denied mr mauks request to participate in a fourth year of athletic competition for reasons completely beyond mr mauks control
4522332 thats ludicrous to even think that we would put him on the field and put our football team in harms way
4522333 we look forward to explaining more fully our reasons for the decision and the careful review given not only by our staff but also by representatives from our member schools
4522334 we believe the ncaa has treated ben differently than it has other athletes with very very similar circumstances

4522347 down the street arvato formerly sonopress had 60 people leave their job site when ice raided mills to the credit of this companys management per information passed to our office by someone in the plant those 60 people were subsequently fired and now arvato is in the process of rehiring like mills they are using the e verify program to make sure that their new employees are legal citizens
4522348 much has been said about the negative impact to the illegal aliens affected the company and the families of those involved i share sympathy for anyone who makes bad choices and has consequence but most of the stories i have read are mighty enthusiastic about the victim end of the equation and mighty indifferent to the accountability end of the equation

4522354 papa jack its andy warhol on the phone and your 15 minutes are up
4522355 i came to denver in 1928 there were 200 people here now theres 2 million damn californians
4522356 they say i have an amazing memory for my age
4522357 i dont have too much to say about him except he was a hillbilly sob
4522358 the greatest thing about being a dad is watching max grow and seeing him do new things every day
4522359 the majority of teachers ive talked to want a settlement
4522360 we said at least three times our goal is to get a settlement
4522361 so youre always going to have differing opinions on any issue that comes up
4522362 he didnt look good to me and i knew this could be it
4522363 i said hey bernard how are you and i kissed his forehead
4522364 he shrugged his shoulders like im tired and i said i know youre tired later on that night it took a turn for the worse
4522365 the doctor came in and i said hes gone isnt he
4522366 he said you never seen a black man as pretty as me
4522367 i said what do you have for me and he kissed me that was our first kiss
4522368 its basically an expression of luck we feel fortunate to be able to do this for a decade and a half a lot of the songs that are on the record kind of express our contentment and our general acknowledgment of good fortune
4522369 weve done our share of work but a lot of bands that have worked hard for whatever reason have collapsed under its own weight for one reason or another weve been lucky to have fans who have supported us for such a long time
4522370 its been steadily growing for a decade or so that weve been playing there
4522371 everywhere weve played its always grown steadily the momentum of it has been very rewarding to be honest the last tour that we did for the last record was the first time the us passed canada in ticket sales and stuff so its very very thrilling and very exciting
4522372 were not a band that has a pile of choreography or loops
4522373 we have an interactive kind of night the tradition of music here at newfoundland where were from is very inclusive its not like a recital where you envy a virtuoso its more like the best singer is the guy who gets the most people to sing along the best accordion player is the guy who fills the dance floor the most often music is about a celebration and making it a great night
4522374 if we dont do this now carcass will be erased from the history of rock to a certain extent
4522375 theres so much access to information out there but it seems to me that the new generation of kids just really dont know sh they dont really know who black sabbath is never mind carcass theres definitely a generation of kids out there who are not aware of carcass because we havent been around for 15 years a year is a long time in metal these days
4522376 i guess over the last few years weve kind of drifted into each others circles again myself guitarist bill steer and mike and mikes kind of i dont want to over exaggerate this but hes always been the keenest to do this because since he formed arch enemy and has been out on the road again hes kind of realized what kind of phenomenon carcass is
4522377 mikes always been kind of hassling me and bill on the side about doing something and so i guess the stars aligned at some point because for years i said id never do it if drummer ken owen who suffered a brain hemorrhage in 1999 couldnt play i thought it would be a bit like led zeppelin playing without john bonham how can you kind of find a way around that
4522378 it seems to me nostalgia is the new rock and roll not to sound arrogant but im well aware of the importance of this band even if no one else is theres a generation of people who were into carcass whove grown up now that never saw the band and now they have some disposable income theyve created the demand for this reunion
4522379 never say never but i cant see it happening i cant see it working
4522380 for something like that to happen everybodys head has to be on the same continent
4522381 these bands that start playing again some of them get carried away and they write an album and they start saying its the best thing we ever done and then it just isnt we dont want to be one of those bands we dont want to be doing this next year i could maybe see us playing again in some of the countries that were not touching this year but lets see if we kill each other when were in north america on a tour bus were getting on great but we want to keep that chemistry and not get burned out we dont want to be doing it just for the money because it can turn into a chore thats what happened the first time it seemed like work and it wasnt fun anymore so i figured f this ill go get a job if youre doing something just for the money i think having a job is a bit more honest than playing in a band just for the money
4522382 its like everything just merges into one nowadays everythings sounding the same the problem with the modern metal scene is people are too busy copying bands wholesale and not actually taking an influence and doing something new with it i dont think its laziness i think it just comes down to imagination and intelligence
4522383 ozzy did it and even zakk wyldes done it playing with black label and ozzy
4522384 other people have done it but as far as vocally its just me and ozzy its good company to be in hes the dude that basically created this niche i think it would be pretty grueling to do it for a full tour
4522385 christian bale attended a london police station on a voluntary basis in order to assist with an allegation that has been made against him to the police by his mother and sister

4522387 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold
4522388 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film released july 11 2007 which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4522389 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4522390 post production on half blood prince was completed on time and the studios release plans for the will not be affected by this change
4522391 i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of director david yates and our incomparable cast
4522392 i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4522393 even as we put finishing touches on this latest film
4522394 we are already beginning preparations on the final two films and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve
4522395 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4522396 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that senator mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4522397 i need to find somebody to help create this game because it will be a great game
4522398 theres a time and place for everything and now is the time
4522399 i felt like there was no bigger event in hip hop at this moment than me and t i working together
4522400 it was always turmoil between our camp and his camp us as the bosses of our companies everyone is gonna follow our lead wed figure if it aint no problem and we dont have no issues no beef then theres no reason we shouldnt be able to get together and make music that was an executive decision that was made on both our behalves
4522401 i was surprised just as much as everybody else was
4522402 i talked to luda and he said it was time to sit down do business make grown man moves both of them got albums coming out time to try new things cris did something for t i too that nobody heard yet its about to come out soon its a good move
4522403 its showing that once great minds set their differences aside they can make something happen

4522417 once i got comfortable with having diabetes frankie used to call me pancreas boy but hes the cutest kid alive so he can get away with it

4522432 obama sleeps with a teddy bear and a night light
4522433 but its important to understand that many of the country blues masters represented here were friends of jacks these blues share a tremendous amount in both form and substance with the folk music of the same era the 1930s and few people made any such distinctions during that day everybody was dipping from the same stream be it woody guthrie or tampa red jimmie rodgers or furry lewis and jack drank it all in his approach is fresh but authentic hes using an old language but hes speaking in the present tense
4522434 dylan learned from me the same way i learned from woody
4522435 rick ross orchestrated a brutal attack upon dj vlad carried out at his direction by his accomplices in retribution for media coverage of
4522436 painstakingly created his public persona to be that of a major drug dealer and gangster but is in reality a former correctional officer
4522437 ive been hearing things about me on your web site we gonna make a story we going to see each other we going to talk where are you
4522438 following a brief conversation between dj vlad and ross in which ross said we got beef ross accomplices who had surrounded dj vlad while he spoke with ross proceeded to strike and beat dj vlad in ross presence and without any protest on ross part

4522440 instead of the storm water and the combined flows which includes human waste going onto the beach it will go into this tunnel
4522441 its perfectly suited to deal with the negative impacts weve seen this year
4522442 with the billions of dollars that have been spent on wastewater treatment in this country it is simply unacceptable that we have so many beautiful days with closed beaches
4522443 this will go a long way to ensuring that citizens have access to clean beaches on a consistent basis
4522444 the beach closures weve had this summer when weve had these major storm events really disadvantage the residents so people who live in the city have fewer recreation opportunities than people who live in the suburbs or on the coast
4522445 there arent that many warm days in new england and the public needs to be able to enjoy every one they get
4522446 money is important in life it does not give you happiness we all know but it sure calms the nerves

4522497 this experimental technique remains long and costly for the moment but were hoping it will hold the promise of a completely innovative and widely available treatment in the future
4522498 at this stage we have shown that the technique doesnt cause side effects or an undesirable auto immune response

4522500 i suspected something when i found the first bird in gabon since it didnt exactly match any of the species descriptions in the field guides
4522501 once i was able to compare them side by side to other specimens in our collections it was clear that these birds were special you of course have to be cautious but i was still very excited at the prospect of possibly having found a new species of bird
4522502 finding the olive backed forest robin strongly underscores the importance of our research this helps us show the conservation importance of the area
4522503 although finding an unknown species like the olive backed forest robin was not the goal of the mab project
4522504 it is definitely a reminder that the world still holds surprises for us
4522505 has the potential to change the way people do archaeology
4522506 this approach really brings in the computer as a research partner to archaeologists
4522507 we mimic the archaeologists methods as much as possible so that they can really use our system as a tool
4522508 when fully developed this system could reduce the time needed to reconstruct a wall from years to months it could free up archaeologists for other valuable tasks such as restoration and ethnographic study
4522509 this showed that the system could work in a real life situation
4522510 having this ability to really exhaustively try everything very quickly could potentially be quite helpful

4522628 since i still go back and forth quite a bit i can easily say that the two biggest benefits of static languages for me in net is the compiler crutch to catch my syntax errors and the rich rich discoverability i think the latter could maybe be addressed with dynamic languages and really smart development environments but were not there yet
4522629 but what would be really cool imho is if we could more easily switch and access dynamic language code right from within static code for those few operations when dynamic code is just easier the easy ability to define say a ruby code block and just execute it inline or via some stringbased mechanism would really allow bringing the richness of dynamic code to static languages the dlr almost has this but it stops just a little short of making this code more genericly callable

4522642 without a degree it was next to impossible to get a job
4522643 so i started taking a course here and there at the community college
4522644 it was really frustrating the classes came easily for me and i was helping classmates who in another month or so would graduate and get jobs
4522645 but i could talk till i was blue in the face and they wouldnt even consider me
4522646 we decided to leave the fairfax area to train and put to work nontraditional folks in the information technology field
4522647 we kept hearing about the programmer shortage and we believed that it wasnt as much an issue of worker shortage as it was worker distribution so we moved to a place that had higher unemployment 11 percent and underemployment if people had the aptitude they could learn
4522648 my cobol programming instructor said i should give them a call
4522649 they gave me a chance to learn on the job they give employees the time to learn new things and encourage you to learn all you can its the perfect environment
4522650 but the shortages in technology are over and above the general shortage
4522651 if im a programmer and i know cobol im worth at least 10 percent more
4522652 the biggest risk is that high tech workers will price themselves right out of the market
4522653 things could become less competitive if the cost base gets too high thats why companies are considering other benefits like stock options and quality of life
4522654 its becoming common practice to pay bonuses to employees for recruiting
4522655 they can get up to 15 000 for a name that works out companies are getting more and more creative they might give them a laptop or a sign on bonus
4522656 its not just salaries but they offer stock options creative work arrangements flex schedules jogging paths restaurants creative studios
4522657 companies have to look for new resources to solve the problem instead of fighting over the same resources
4522658 stealing employees is not a good thing we need to work together to control ourselves and find new resources it may be more painful and take more time but in the long run it will reduce the problem
4522659 there is a big misconception that you need to be a geek to enter this field
4522660 only about a quarter of the positions require advanced degrees
4522661 many of the positions the russians are filling are ones that require maintenance on existing systems oftentimes u s workers dont want to be in the backwaters of computer maintenance
4522662 our president sent me an e mail asking me to see him
4522663 eds wanted to see how effective this kind of training was so they tested one of the students and he tested as though he had 12 years experience
4522664 the reaction to the program is beyond my wildest dreams
4522665 there is obviously a pent up demand in the hampton roads area
4522666 the education community was poised to be responsive we just had to tell them what we needed
4522667 when i started out i knew how to type and get around windows 3 1
4522668 but each day i had a few hours to sit and learn new programs that summer i learned quattro pro word perfect and d base and that opened up more opportunities
4522669 i never said no and i think that helped get me even more projects
4522670 we treat them like junior professionals and we pay them a couple dollars more than minimum wage
4522671 the offer made me feel that if i can get an offer from new york city i can get a job anywhere
4522672 even though it was a tough decision i felt that at user technologies i have more opportunity to do my own personal thing
4522673 when you ask companies to help sometimes theyre not sure how
4522674 but if you say i need 20 computers and so many feet of cable theyre right there technology people are task oriented
4522675 we just cant keep doing what were doing now in the future
4522676 we will have to rely on a greater use of technology and come up with more creative approaches

4522693 our top three nearest competitors are x y and z although all of them are trying to be destination sites and the teams behind them dont have a history in the target market we on the other hand are multimodal being a website mobile application and social web application and weve been living and breathing this space for the past 3 years
4522694 our plan calls for 3mm which gets us from beta product through a 1 0 launch and an early partner business model over the coming 12 months
4522695 we all have so much fun together im so lucky my dad and ashton get along its not weird theres no jealousy or drama if we werent all entirely morally opposed to doing a reality show i guarantee it would be the best selling reality show ever
4522696 for the most part we have a uav on station for the majority of missions that involve the capture of high value targets or terrorists
4522697 the aircraft is an active contributor to the actual apprehension of these criminals
4522698 its hard to imagine combat today without uavs the aircrafts capabilities are continuously improving and they are beginning to do a lot of the same missions as our manned aircraft
4522699 our guys fly them out hand them off to the brigade combat teams in theatre and at that time the specific brigade tuav elements actually fly the missions
4522700 at the conclusion of a shadow mission the brigades route the aircraft back into our airspace and the uav operators here pick the aircraft back up and land them once they land we conduct maintenance and prep them for another mission
4522701 everything we do in terms of maintaining the aircraft is annotated by inputting information into our computer system we keep track of just about anything you can think from actual flight hours to required services and inspections
4522702 the uavs can provide at least 70 percent of the support you would get from an attack helicopter minus the armament
4522703 the operators can observe perform route reconnaissance and report immediately over voice what they see to the ground forces very similar to conventional aerial reconnaissance methods its very helpful
4522704 the shadow provides coverage for a lot of raids we do road scans for roadside bombs and have actually caught terrorists in the act of implanting these bombs in the road the uav mission is imperative to todays combat operations
4522705 when the infantry troops are going into a certain area to clear buildings well go in ahead of time and scan the area and well be able to report to them exact grids of potential enemies in the area
4522706 keeping soldiers safe on the battlefield is number one this is definitely a technology that will always be part of the fight
4522707 ha nah you see la next time will you liddat
4522708 well at least they wont try to make another sequel after this miserable flop

4522795 he then proceeded to neglect our relationship with russia at a time when putin was strangling any opposition in the country when he was consolidating power rattling sabers against his european neighbors as well as satellites of the former soviet union and so we did not send a signal to mr putin that in fact we were going to be serious about issues like human rights issues like international cooperation that were critical to us that is something that we have to change
4522796 natos north atlantic council should convene in emergency session to demand a ceasefire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia

4522813 for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any twoedged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart
4522814 but be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving you own selves
4522815 for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strong holds casting down imaginations and every high thing that
4522816 all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness
4522817 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose
4522818 he that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him

4522823 there are a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4522824 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4522825 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4522826 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4522827 these unsubstantiated spate of reports are totally baseless and malicious
4522828 once they issue impeachment proceedings against him and issue a charge sheet then it will become almost inevitable that he will want to answer those charges
4522829 he feels very strongly that a lot of that is being said is not correct
4522830 we have conveyed to them that the coalition is determined for impeachment and if he wants to save himself the best way is for him to quit
4522831 if a person moves to the side we are not in the habit of bothering him this would not be a good attitude if someone is lying on the ground and we go aggressively against him

4522844 john mccains decision to raise money from one of the key figures in the jack abramoff scandal one of abramoffs conspirators in a money laundering scheme is a very disappointing example of john mccain abandoning his principles on the campaign trail he claimed to be a reformer well reformer no more
4522845 so deep was ralph reed involved in jack abramoffs schemes to bilk his clients and advance gambling interests so caught up in the washington culture of corruption was ralph reed that he lost a party primary in georgia for lieutenant governor in 2006 but even after all that disgrace after all that controversy after the reports of tainted money john mccain is depending on ralph reed of all people to fill his campaign coffers
4522846 raising money with ralph reed shows that the john mccain who ran in 2000 would have a hard time considering voting for the john mccain we see today senator mccain has changed hes taking advice from karl rove and karl roves minions and now hes adopting karl rove and dick cheney anything goes style of low road politics the john mccain who used to go out and try to root out this sort of corruption is now appearing to me to be a desperate candidate who will say anything and raise money anywhere with absolutely anyone to pay for a lot of the false and negative ads that we have seen

4522850 rodney has a proven track record of success over his 20 years of experience in executive positions and the board is confident he has the skills and expertise needed to lead loud technologies into the future
4522851 his focus will be on integrating our recent acquisition of martin audio while also overseeing sales and marketing to help loud technologies and our dealer partners drive our stable of well established brands

4522870 the jurys use of the bible here amounts to a type of private communication contact or tampering that is outside the evidence and law

4522933 they climbed down through a series of boulders and rocks to get down to the water

4522984 these are some of my favorite songs for the spring 09 season each one has a unique tone but they share a common theme of love and happiness
4522985 the first one is an old rock classic but we would remix it to speed it up and give it a modern edge then the last three are newer songs that are fun youthful and have a great beat tunes that are sexy and modern that a woman would have on her playlist to host a fabulous cocktail party
4522986 i love the lyrics to this song one mile in the air thats where she lives her body looks so thin and pink and small dropping eggs from nervous shaking hands and swallowing her fingers as they fall

4523038 in order to determine whether there was an apparent reason to combine the known elements in the fashion claimed

4523051 the deal has the potential to be substantially more accretive than we have currently allowed for in our numbers it has all the hallmarks of a traditional qbe acquisition entering a market with a distressed seller and obtaining a business at an attractive price
4523052 in our view the market has been keen to see qbe make another material acquisition to offset the ongoing leakage in the global premium cycle

4523068 ive actually been out talking with people asking questions hey how long you been here do you guys know about the flag system and i was totally shocked at the people that said they didnt know about the flag system
4523069 i thought well they are not going to muck this up i knew they would be taking special care of me

4523090 hows the voter supposed to know by reading the ballot title and summary that the hold harmless amount only applies to one year
4523091 is misleading and fails to adequately inform the voter of the chief purposes of the amendment
4523092 you cannot suggest a trade off when one does not exist
4523093 i dont know if im the average voter but i had to read two or three hours to figure out what that means
4523094 i think amendment 5 may have the biggest impact on our future
4523095 has never called me invited me sent me flowers or chocolates
4523096 there was no other issue out there that was as important
4523097 i know this wont be a popular opinion to fans but no they are not
4523098 im sure people are getting excited around the notion of it but its not exercising peoples minds here

4523106 u s army lieutenant colonel diane m zierhoffer a licensed psychologist who had ordered the torture of a juvenile detainee and refused to testify under section 831 article 31 of the uniform code of military justice which prohibits compulsory self incrimination as a right under the fifth amendment
4523107 an institutionalized program of psychological torture supervised by teams of cia psychologists and the pentagons behavioral science consultation teams bsct staffed predominantly by psychologists
4523108 the fact that the bsct psychologist now apparently recognizes that her conduct was criminal in nature is very significant
4523109 we have alleged based on classified government records that the bsct psychologists recommendation led directly to the illegal abuse and inhumane treatment of mohammad jawad this invocation of the right to remain silent seems to confirm that
4523110 the evidence in this case confirms our worst fears that military psychologists are working to break down detainees psyches
4523111 todays developments only confirms our view that a full accounting of the shadowy bsct program is long overdue
4523112 the continuing silence of the apa on member involvement in torture is telling
4523113 no apa leader or official has ever uttered one word critical of actual u s abuse or of the role of psychologists and psychological expertise in that abuse they continue to stonewall on disciplining any psychologists who participated despite promises to investigate
4523114 to identify weaknesses in detainees that can be exploited to break them down psychologically and render them dependent upon the interrogators
4523115 in the eyes of the world psychologists are being seen as aiders and abettors of torture the damage to the profession grows day by day and the shamefulness of it reflects on all of us whether we like it or not
4523116 what has this country come to when a licensed psychologist a senior officer in the u s armed forces someone trained in the art of healing broken hearts and mending broken minds someone with a duty to do no harm turns her years of training and education to the art of breaking people to the intentional devastation of a lonely homesick teenage boy
4523117 i ran out of my house to join 10 people trying to lift up the bus

4523119 the light turned red and i couldnt stop i tried to miss her
4523120 its a terrible poignancy that donnettes sons birthday will now coincide with the day his mother died

4523240 ive spoken all week about how much ive enjoyed the olympic experience how much i love the spirit of it
4523241 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4523242 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself
4523243 fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4523244 i mean its just one point there is an umpire if im 100 percent sure about it i mean i will give it but im not sure
4523245 whatever is going to get him to have some sleep tonight then thats fine
4523246 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4523247 made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else
4523248 and then she forgave me and we went to work on it
4523249 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4523250 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake
4523251 she had cramps and was very uncomfortable she had diarrhea and was throwing up she was pretty miserable
4523252 i really turned it on and let it go everything came together i feel so fortunate there was a point in the race i thought things could go really well or really bad
4523253 i just ran the first 50 meters then i looked around to make sure i was safe and shut it off
4523254 i have no secrets i just run im ready for my best i got my stride back
4523255 i just know i need to relax and do the things my body knows best im just really glad i got to the final
4523256 im living this for the thousands of people i grew up with and those who raised me
4523257 since our last price reduction on august 7th the market cost of shells fuel products have continued to reduce

4523270 hes up there in the sat 10 scores im not sure if hell qualify all the sudden they come up with this thing where they have to pre qualify ill need to come up with a contingency

4523272 to create a nurturing environment that promotes a positive home school relationship

4523299 barack obama is directly contrary to many positions and beliefs of martin luther king jr
4523300 obama is trying to make african americans believe he is the reality of the dream come true but hes not its a nightmare
4523301 senator obamas answer to the ills of society of higher government spending weaker national defense continued tax dollars to planned parenthood and support of gay marriage are diametrically opposed to everything african americans truly believe and an anathema to the dream of dr martin luther king jr
4523302 it is high time for black america white america and all america to stop making their ethnicity such a big deal that we become zealous for our color over being zealous for what is right and what is truth
4523303 i will not remain silent out of fear of repercussions because it is politically incorrect for blacks to challenge blacks
4523304 intimidation because many people are afraid to scrutinize obama and speak out because of the race issue
4523305 in reality he is not a black american his heritage is muslim not african american
4523306 does not remotely parallel the values traditions and struggles of black america
4523307 to look deeper at barack obama the man his voting record and his position on the important issues facing our country
4523308 it is obvious obama is trying to solidify the black vote

4523310 the negro cannot win as long as he is willing to sacrifice the lives of his children for comfort and safety

4523313 life was very precious to my uncle and life today is precious

4523315 it is practically and financially untenable to hold the 2014 winter olympic games less than 20 miles 32 kilometers from a zone of conflict particularly when the prospective host country has played a significant role in the escalation of that conflict

4523321 i think he is recognized by all the nfl people as a player who has tremendous potential
4523322 but he is one of the toughest kids ive coached at that position and hes had some terrific games when he was hurt
4523323 its tough maybe you dont feel situated as quickly when you get into the game
4523324 without the reps in practice it might be the second quarter before youre feeling 100 percent comfortable with whats happening on the field
4523325 it was a terrible race the time was very fast but thank god i did it
4523326 it was really very tough but i am not afraid of any race

4523330 i would have to say being a leader first stepping up taking care of the ball ball security is always important for us and putting some points on the board so we can get a win
4523331 we want to see troy play quarterback well and do the things that winning quarterbacks do move the team make good decisions operate the offense and avoid the costly mistake
4523332 we want our offense to be aggressive we never say dont turn the ball over its aggressive ball security
4523333 we want to score a lot of points and we want to secure the football its going to be the same thing with troy were going to be aggressive in everything we do offensively were not buttoning anything down ever its just not our mind set
4523334 i dont think about things just in context of myself its about the team all the time

4523374 a year ago and stop to read whatever he puts into the public presses he was on bill moyers journal the other day
4523375 our foreign policy is something that is concocted in washington dc but it reflects the perceptions of our political elite about what we the people want
4523376 and what we want by and large is this continuing flow of very cheap consumer goods we want to be able to pump gas into our cars regardless of how big they may happen to be and we want to be able to do these things without having to think about whether or not the books are balanced at the end of the month or the end of the fiscal year
4523377 one of the ways we avoid confronting our refusal to balance the books is to rely increasingly on the projection of american military power around the world to try to maintain this dysfunctional system or set of arrangements that have evolved over the last 30 or 40 years
4523378 i think historians a hundred years from now will puzzle over how it could be that the united states of america the most powerful nation in the world as far back as the early 1970s came to recognize that dependence on foreign oil was a problem posed a threat compromised our freedom of action how every president from richard nixon down declared were going to fix the problem but none of them did

4523392 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4523393 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them

4523418 voice is inherently multi factor if you have to say your password or account number
4523419 its gotten good enough for prime time you can get a spoken token from a voiceprint
4523420 alone it has a 95 per cent accuracy rate but if a multi factor solution is used its 99 per cent
4523421 if someone enrolled on a landline home phone but then calls on a cell phone the system may reject the user the audio acoustics are different and data gets mixed in the voiceprint
4523422 the odds of someone who knows your passphrase breaking into your house to impersonate you are pretty low
4523423 but theres been significant spending on speaker verification on the forensic side by law enforcement to catch bad guys via wiretaps and this may help subsidize more commercial uses
4523424 no reliable third party testing has been done on more than two or three products
4523425 and a 99 per cent accuracy rate is not that great it means one out of 100 fails but that translates into thousands of rejections in high volume areas
4523426 with speech recognition the voice xml standard is what opened the market and made it possible to integrate it in applications without being tied to proprietary systems this revolutionized the ivr market but were not there yet with speaker verification
4523427 government entities wont do wide deployments as theyre mandated to use technology that has standards
4523428 the event has turned into one of the highlights of my year
4523429 everyone has been so supportive and im really proud of the money weve been able to raise for vanderbilt over the last few years
4523430 companies assured the minister that consumers would be able to report unsolicited text messages to their service provider
4523431 in the current deregulated telecommunications market the federal government has no intention of interfering with the day to day business decisions of private companies
4523432 though we will certainly be watching for extreme cases where someone is sending us more in refunds than they are getting in text messages
4523433 clients should contact us e mail or phone to have the charges reversed
4523434 it treats consumers as if their time has no value
4523435 putting the onus on the consumer is wrong its like the post office asking for a second stamp to be put on every letter delivered to your house
4523436 weve never had such a response as we have on this petition
4523437 its an enormous response i think these companies have become so large they feel they can just steamroll over customers
4523438 prentices latest announcement that he wants to voice his concern is pretty accurate because thats all he can do
4523439 it sounds like hes been told to backpedal the government is trying to get their fingers out of the works of the telecom industry
4523440 no matter how much advance time they give you they should wait until a contract is renewable before they make that kind of change
4523441 calls on the industry for self regulation and voluntary reduction of roaming prices for text messages have not been answered
4523442 eu citizens should be free to text across borders without being ripped off
4523443 you need governments to step in when corporations dont know where the boundaries of decency are
4523444 why should someone pay for something they never even asked for
4523445 i mean i know i dont have a chance in the world
4523446 thats not why im doing this im just trying to get people to think
4523447 even if i dont get elected my hopes are that this campaign will inspire voters to look behind the candidates images and rhetoric for the real messages
4523448 that which is hateful to you do not do to another the rest of the torah is all commentary now go study

4523450 piece about interesting dress and culture things that were floating around the web that week
4523451 summer with which ive got a million school academic things to do but im determined to rock out a bit
4523452 unless the good lord sends two more inches of rain well be alright
4523453 it will be tight but the fence will be in stalled this week and then the poles for the lights can be set and the concrete bleachers will follow as soon as the light poles are set we can place the con crete bleachers the poles for the lighting are placed by the large trucks and with the ground as soft we have to wait and let the field dry out so the truck want bog down in the soft dirt
4523454 everything is on go except for the press box but we can play without a press box
4523455 it will be a historical event for the school hopefully everything will be ready
4523456 it worked out well for us to schedule autauga academy they are a natural rival and we enjoy our relationship with the administration at autauga
4523457 hopefully we will be ready to play i under stand it will be a different type academy team with the new coach we should have a big crowd for the first game on cam pus our kids are excited

4523462 rick ross orchestrated a brutal attack upon dj vlad carried out at his direction by his accomplices in retribution for media coverage of rick ross prior life as a correctional officer
4523463 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4523464 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4523465 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4523466 kami juga mengumumkan bahwa jumlah partisipasi pemilih di pilwalkot bandung hampir mencapai 70 persen atau tepatnya 69 89 persen
4523467 jika saja dalam waktu 14 hari dipergunakan seluruhnya maka perolehan suara untuk pasangan yang bukan incumbent akan lebih besar dan partisipasi pemilih akan meningkat
4523468 jika anggaran itu direalisasikan 20 persen maka pendidikan di tanah air akan lebih berkualitas dan maju

4523470 home prices in the us are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
4523471 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
4523472 i think the worst of this housing problem may well be over
4523473 a national severe price distortion seems most unlikely in the united states given its size and diversity
4523474 the fed financed takeover of investment bank bear stearns also made government backing of fannie and freddie debt inevitable
4523475 theres no credible argument for bailing out bear stearns and not the gses
4523476 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4523477 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4523478 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4523479 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4523480 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4523481 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4523482 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4523483 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4523484 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4523485 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4523486 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4523487 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4523488 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4523489 who are open to doing something on the production side
4523490 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4523491 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4523492 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4523493 pameran lukisan kali ini merupakan serangkaian acara untuk mempererat hubungan budaya indonesia taiwan dan lebih mengenalkan indonesia kepada masyarakat taiwan
4523494 momen yang tepat untuk lebih memperkenalkan indonesia kepada masyarakat taiwan
4523495 melalui pameran itu kita dapat mempromosikan kepada masyarakat kita mengenai budaya masyarakat indonesia sekaligus mengobati kerinduan para imigran dan pengusaha indonesia akan kampung halaman
4523496 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4523497 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4523498 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4523499 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4523500 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4523501 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4523502 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4523503 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4523504 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4523505 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4523506 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4523507 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4523508 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4523509 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4523510 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4523511 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4523512 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4523513 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4523514 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4523515 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4523516 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4523517 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4523518 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4523519 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4523520 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4523521 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4523522 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4523523 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4523524 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4523525 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4523526 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4523527 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4523528 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4523529 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4523530 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4523531 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4523532 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4523533 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4523534 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4523535 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4523536 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4523537 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4523538 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4523539 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4523540 troopers deputies and officers of all agencies encourage motorists to respect the workers that are doing their jobs in our work zones as we have stepped up enforcement of the laws related to vehicular traffic in these areas
4523541 ignoring this request may result in serious or even deadly consequences
4523542 one death in a work zone is simply one too many
4523543 didnt i see you on thomas emmerts ridge this afternoon

4523557 mr tom emmerts dead he and his wife lizzy died last night when their house burned down more than likely it was caused by a smoldering ember landing on their roof
4523558 weve already paid our taxes sheriff whats this all about john asked

4523560 but the standard variable rate is funded by a mix of retail deposits and the rate at which banks can borrow on wholesale markets
4523561 banks would obviously like to pass on any reductions in the official cash rate by the rba but the cash rate is only one determinant of short term funding costs there are other considerations as well
4523562 thats significantly reduced the banks marginal cost of short term funding i think that means theres no obvious reason the banks could not pass through any change in the cash rate
4523563 doing our best to pass on as much as we can
4523564 no longer a reasonable guide to the cost of bank funding
4523565 if its good enough on the way up to lift mortgage rates it should be good enough on the way down
4523566 but whether banks will cut rates is another matter they may not if the recent new zealand experience is any guide
4523567 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim
4523568 it just looks like a costume with some fake guys thrown on top for effect

4523576 policy of releasing pregnant women primary caretakers and workers with health concerns as humanitarian
4523577 as people we need to reclaim our dignity no matter the challenges before us
4523578 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4523579 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4523580 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4523581 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4523582 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4523583 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4523584 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4523585 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4523586 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4523587 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4523588 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4523589 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4523590 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4523591 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4523592 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4523593 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4523594 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4523595 creating your bedroom hair look should be a cleaned up prettier version of your reflection
4523596 were talking hair thats been thrown around and has got a little sweat induced wave
4523597 the easiest way to achieve bedroom hair is to separate your hair into five or six sections and then wrap each section around a large barreled curling iron letting the ends poke out messily
4523598 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4523599 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

4523601 vitor is out i spoke with him i think yesterday and he told me actually it was on tuesday we had a conversation for about an hour or so and yeah i guess he broke his hand in two places is what he told me and he had been having 2 3 and 4 opinions on it he finally got the opinion that he wanted i guess and they told him to step out for a while
4523602 they came and offered me what i thought i was worth and im happy to be a part of it
4523603 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4523604 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

4523615 for his contributions and for the ultimate sacrifice he made in the name of protecting torontonians we all owe him a huge debt of gratitude that can never be repaid
4523616 its a sad day for us for sure whenever theres a loss of life we feel at heart especially when its one our own
4523617 you never think these things are going to happen but they happen and its rough

4523625 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
4523626 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4523627 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4523628 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4523629 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4523630 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4523631 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4523632 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4523633 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4523634 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4523635 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4523636 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4523637 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4523638 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4523639 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4523640 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4523641 la pr ctica de los consejeros viola la ley ind gena 19 253 y los principios ticos al asumir posiciones vitalicias y patrimoniales sobre la conadi
4523642 nosotros queremos que el gobierno le d una soluci n a los problemas de tierra que tenemos en diferentes comunidades tambi n rechazamos la actuaci n de estos consejeros que est n imponiendo su derecho afirmando que el trabajo que ellos hacen es verdadero nosotros decimos que el gobierno est buscando un medio para buscar soluciones en estas comunidades
4523643 el fiscal de la forestal mininco ha estado amedrentando a las comunidades mapuche de chequenco y antinao oblig ndoles a declarar en contra de nosotros que actualmente nos encontramos recluidos en la c rcel de temuco y de angol a muchos mapuche de la comunidad se les est ofreciendo dinero y artefactos como celulares para que declaren y esp en a su propia gente
4523644 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales

4523646 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4523647 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables

4523649 umbral de un verdadero golpe de estado contra el orden constitucional
4523650 al t pico estilo de las dictaduras que precedieron a la recuperaci n de la democracia en 1982
4523651 toman aeropuertos toman cortes departamentales electorales y balean carros coches de ministros
4523652 las fuerzas armadas son los garantes de la democracia concepto que incluye el precepto constitucional de garantizar la estabilidad del gobierno legalmente constituido sea el actual o cualquier otro que recoja la voluntad del pueblo que es el gran soberano

4523657 tratamos de producir obras de denuncia claras y provocadoras que hagan reaccionar a la prensa y suscitar esfuerzos de destruccion de la obra por parte de aquellos que no puedan soportarla haciendo mucho ruido y volviendo accesible el mensaje a los que no pertenecen al campo

4523661 nuestros peque os productores agr colas son masacrados por la brutal injusticia del entorno del comercio internacional
4523662 en la globalizaci n el campesino o campesina pierde su identidad social cultural y econ mica de productor ahora un campesino es consumidor de semillas y qu micos caros que venden las poderosas corporaciones trasnacionales por medio de poderosos latifundistas y prestamistas locales
4523663 a menudo lo han hecho en unos t rminos muy desfavorables para los granjeros pobres dejando a estos con m s inseguridad alimentaria y a los gobiernos a depender de unas ayudas internacionales poco predecibles
4523664 muchas de las empresas privadas que vinieron a reemplazar a los investigadores estatales resultaron ser monopolistas en busca de dinero
4523665 no pensamos que el coste humano de esos programas seria tan grande y que las ganancias econ micas tardasen tanto en llegar
4523666 el sector paraestatal continuar a siendo un riesgo para la exitosa implementaci n del presupuesto de 2002 03 las intervenciones del gobierno en la agricultura y otros mercados alimentarios est n socavando otras inversiones m s productivas

4523672 todas somos coordinadoras cada una de nosotras desde su organizaci n nacional no necesitamos formar una nueva instancia organizativa para la cumbre de mujeres
4523673 estamos preparando la cumbre de mujeres ind genas con la m s amplia participaci n para plasmar de manera conjunta la dif cil situaci n de los pueblos ind genas del continente y construir propuestas no solo para las mujeres sino para todos desde una mirada de mujer
4523674 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
4523675 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
4523676 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos
4523677 el 11 de julio inform por oficio al ministro del interior de la gravedad de los hechos que est n ocurriendo en nuestra comuna y hasta la fecha no he recibido respuesta alguna percibo que est violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales por eso pido el m ximo de preocupaci n para resolver este problema
4523678 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e
4523679 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4523680 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4523681 los pueblos originarios no fueron incluidos en la discusi n de la lge
4523682 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim
4523683 it just looks like a costume with some fake guys thrown on top for effect
4523684 its not on endangered species on any list that weve got
4523685 the remains of a small gorilla or chimpanzee that may have undergone some taxidermy treatment
4523686 this is the first zero tolerance agency meeting in conjunction with the department of education for our kids its good they are at the table
4523687 hopefully we can create uniform language that will keep them safe and at the same time rehabilitate them while they are in school we have to be on the same page there cant be a subjective response to kids behaviors
4523688 lock em up to more community based prevention and diversionary programs without jeopardizing public safety
4523689 it is too costly for the state to continue housing these kids we want to get to them earlier and have more resources
4523690 the second paragraph of the statute provides for student suspension for up to a year as long as you have it written like that anyone who wants to hide behind it can everyone is talking about gangs
4523691 on the florida attorney generals web site the first thing you see is about gangs when we suspend a kid we send him straight to the streets and into gangs we are complaining about gangs but not saying anything about the department of education sending them to gangs
4523692 with the current education tax cuts we will see zero tolerance intensify the schoolto jailhouse pipeline further burdening the court system where they cant deal with true violent crimes instead of petty discipline issues the educational system not the teachers as much as the administrators are abdicating their roles
4523693 the state is still coming up with new ways to throw them out of school these kids want to be suspended or expelled
4523694 its a serious problem when we in a state allow more money to be put into building jails than into our schools
4523695 weve seen a two percent decrease in overall crime and a 10 percent decrease in the number of felonies were doing something right not just us but many of the other organizations that make up a community
4523696 we want the community becoming more engaged with youth and not being as punitive bring them into the fold and let them confront the kids there has to be objective stricter parameters even for the officers as to whether little johnny goes to a prevention program or detention what makes the decision that more minorities go to detention and others go to diversionary programs
4523697 we have a frustration with the inflexibility with the current policy
4523698 there is a demand to step up and produce something that keeps kids in school and achieve academic success while keeping kids safe its a whole school approach and it is having success in australia and new zealand
4523699 the first thing that happens when a child commits an infraction is they go into a restorative justice conference before anything punitive the u s is slower to see the benefits of it
4523700 this is great now i just need to go to management and try and get the funding

4523706 not only is lava rock more abundant but our manufacturing process requires far less energy it is friendly to the environment and the automobiles built with barotex are lighter so they use less energy every mile traveled

4523708 we are delighted that the first production automobile to integrate this technology will be dimoras natalia sls 2 which abounds with technological breakthroughs from bumper to bumper

4523740 the main issue i have with ebook readers is not the reader itself rather the pricing structure for the online downloadable content amazon quote 9 99 for the latest books roughly 5 26 considering you are cutting out the entire production and transport process i find this rather excessive especially if you pop down to tescos or asda who sell many of the latest books at well below this figure
4523741 i pick up a book i dont have to boot it i dont have to swap cartridges or charge batteries its there in my hand ready to go as an exercise in simplicity and convenience reading a book is right up there now with an ebook youre taking that basic model and complicating it almost needlessly

4523750 the problem of niger delta needs a lot of study to actually identify the problem because it is on record that the oil companies exploring oil in the region have alone been doing enough to the people
4523751 we need to know from the oil companies how much they are generating and how much these oil companies pay as royalty or tax to the federal government then we would be able to know better and what is due to the host communities
4523752 they are jobless because they completely lost their occupational trade to give way for oil exploration without directly benefiting from the proceed

4523758 a partir de que espa a hoy m s que nunca se ha vuelto pa s receptor de inmigrantes
4523759 dentro de una sociedad explic send n generalmente se habla de los que llegan de fuera en este caso nos pareci interesante que fueran ellos los artistas invitados de otros pa ses quienes hablaran de la ciudad a la que llegan
4523760 en el contexto del fen meno de la inmigraci n en espa a los latinoamericanos ocupan un papel muy importante por ello creemos que este proyecto adquiere singular inter s desde esa perspectiva
4523761 no se plante como 14 reportajes de madrid sino como un proyecto al que se invit a 14 artistas para que trabajaran en esa ciudad la definici n se bas en esa premisa es decir se trat de que la ciudad fuera el espacio de trabajo en funci n de sus propias propuestas est ticas se tuvo libertad total respecto de los temas y las formas de abordarlos as como en relaci n con los procedimientos t cnicos
4523762 hay una serie de cosas que s aparecen en ciertos trabajos pues a pesar de que la descripci n de la ciudad no constituye un objetivo del proyecto se presentan aspectos importantes como el peso de la historia de un pasado reciente la especulaci n inmobiliaria el fen meno de la inmigraci n o la existencia de lugares anodinos capaces de generar estados de nimo y sentimientos que a la postre acaban convirti ndose en decisivos para la memoria y el recuerdo
4523763 there has been a decision there is a first collective agreement for gatineau for the garage

4523766 russian forces need to leave georgia at once this is no longer 1968
4523767 not only those people who perpetrated this but those who failed to stop it
4523768 the deployment of new anti missile forces has as its aim the russian federation
4523769 therefore any fairy tales about deterring other states fairy tales that with the help of this system we will deter some sort of rogue states no longer work
4523770 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4523771 we very much want the six point plan to be implemented very promptly so that russian troops are no longer in georgia outside abkhazia and south ossetia
4523772 we are looking at the files they are 20 or 23 of the former state governors i believe that in the next two weeks we will know which of them are to be investigated or not

4523796 gibson had motives for ordering the murder further it is clear that the two men accused of carrying out the killing are hiding something
4523797 the intent of the federal sentencing guidelines is to punish a defendant not so much for what theyre convicted of but what they did if that makes sense
4523798 black theology refuses to accept a god who is not identified totally with the goals of the black community if god is not for us and against white people then he is a murderer and we had better kill him the task of black theology is to kill gods who do not belong to the black community black theology will accept only the love of god which participates in the destruction of the white enemy what we need is the divine love as expressed in black power which is the power of black people to destroy their oppressors here and now by any means at their disposal unless god is participating in this holy activity we must reject his love

4523809 i realize that there are conscientious parents who genuinely try to feed their children what they need but they should have no objection to filling out the forms we are introducing describing each of the meals they give
4523810 pro active steps are necessary to insure we are protecting all children
4523811 it is ridiculous not to monitor what all children are fed because of a misguided concern for privacy or freedom and such lack of regulation allows children to slip fatally through the cracks
4523812 parents cannot possibly keep up with each breakthrough in nutritional science and give their children these benefits
4523813 who knows what changes we may need to make next year to improve childrens nutrition
4523814 at a minimum homefeeding programs must be carefully monitored in the domicile to make sure all the latest advances are represented
4523815 during meals at the public cafeterias these children watch educational videos about crucial subjects like the environment sex and the evils of capitalism the food itself is culturally diversified and each day the children are taught a different set of table manners from another culture around the world
4523816 as recently as 1992 the majority of children in the united states were homefed
4523817 even when kids went to school they were allowed to bring lunches packed by their moms

4523824 the committee has poked its nose out of the pocket of the coal sector long enough to tell the australian community that we will be the ones to carry the can for the mega profitable coal giants
4523825 the government needs to explain why the polluter shouldnt pay for cleaning up its own act and carry the risk of burying carbon pollution
4523826 this is a very important industry for the future of australia for the public interest and for the national interest
4523827 we need to find ways to assist the industry to begin
4523828 we feel that in the longer term situation that governments will become responsible anyway

4523838 carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere over the last 150 years is largely human caused
4523839 australias energy security depends on us balancing australias oil and gas exploration and production capacity with our capacity to capture and store greenhouse gases

4523841 personal cultural memory as the acts and products of remembering in which individuals engage to make sense of their lives in relation to the lives of others and to their surroundings situating themselves in time and place
4523842 as our technologies for writing change so do our ways of creating self reflective records memory in other words is always implicated in the act and technology of writing
4523843 blogging itself becomes a real life experience a construction of self that is mediated by tools for reflection and communication in the life of bloggers the medium is not the message but the medium is the experience
4523844 memory work thus involves a complex set of recursive activities that shape our inner worlds reconciling past and present allowing us to make sense of the world around us and constructing an idea of continuity between self and others
4523845 personal cultural memory as the acts and products of remembering in which individuals engage to make sense of their lives in relation to the lives of others and to their surroundings situating themselves in time and place
4523846 in a sociological sense collective memory means that people must felt hey were somehow part of a communal past experiencing a connection between what happened in general and how they were involved as individuals
4523847 over the years both negative and positive appreciations of media and memorys alliance reveal such binary thinking from the days of plato who viewed the invention of writing and script as a degeneration of pure memory meaning untainted by technology every new means of outsourcing our physical capacity to remember has generated resentment
4523848 as an artificial prosthesis they can free the brain of unnecessary burdens and allow more space for creative activity as a replacement they can corrupt memory
4523849 in any case mediated memories never remain the same in the course of time but are constantly prone to the vagaries of time and changing relations between self and others
4523850 memory can be creative in reconstructing the past just as imagination can be reconstructive in memorizing the present think only of the many visual tricks people play to perform the cognitive task of factual recall the function of personal memory even if restricted to studying its mindware is not simply about re creating an accurate picture of ones past but it is about creating a mental map of ones past through the lens of the present
4523851 memory is not exclusively located inside the brain and hence limited to the interior body and it cannot be disembodied because external bodies and technologies are part of the same mutual affect
4523852 if is an illusion to think that memory could be severed from the body because biology and technology body and media have merged beyond distinction
4523853 memory as a result may become less a process of recalling than a topological skill the ability to locate and identify pieces of culture that identify the place of self in relation to others
4523854 the affective constitution of personal memories is well recognized by psychologists when people read or hear reminiscences narrated by others they often feel triggered or invited to contribute their own memories
4523855 just as paper diaries reflect someones age taste and preference at a particular moment in ones life the software and signature of blogs seem to accommodate the needs of especially contemporary teens and young adults to express and sort out their identity in an increasingly wired mediated world
4523856 since early modernity people have tried to imagine and invent memory machines that could remedy two basic shortcomings of the human brain its inability to systematically record and store every single experience in our lives as well as the brains incapacity to retrieve these experiences unchanged at any later moment in time
4523857 digital storage retrieval facilities such as search engines are not merely new metaphors that mold our concepts of memory they actually define the performative nature of memory
4523858 documents of recordings can be stored in a database and we want them to be there unchanged as we retrieve them and subject them to re interpretation memories are never unchanging data that can be stored and retrieved in original shape
4523859 if morphibility and connectivity are becoming the default mode of mediated memories in the digital age we need to adjust our research questions accordingly but with the implementation of digital media tools in the everyday construction of memory our very concept of how memory functions is technically and metaphorically grounded in different parameters does this mean we should now define autobiographical memory by its track changes mode in addition to its save file mode

4523881 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4523882 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4523883 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4523884 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4523885 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4523935 you simply went into the studio turned on the mike and said play
4523936 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright
4523937 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4523938 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
4523939 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
4523940 among my favourite sessions i feel the things we did together were dynamite

4524000 the american academy of pediatrics for many years has supported breast feeding
4524001 it is extremely well researched there are 216 very current references
4524002 what we are now seeing are many things to bring the importance of breastfeeding to our attention there is amazing work neonatologists are doing preterm babies act as a magnifier for how beneficial human milk is for all babies the protection of breastmilk in many instances is life saving it is the gold standard for nutrition there are benefits for years and years later for these babies well off into adulthood we are seeing in iqs an eight point advantage
4524003 the literature is really clear we know about the risks of not breastfeeding based on 25 plus years of research
4524004 we absolutely were thrilled when we saw the new statement
4524005 the annual healthcare costs saved by breastfeeding are stated at 3 6 billion a year
4524006 exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months and continued breastfeeding until at least the first birthday
4524007 the statement reinforces that it is natural to breastfeed for one year
4524008 there is no evidence of psychological damage with extended breastfeeding that is exciting to see
4524009 if we can get women exclusively breastfeeding for six months we would be in good shape
4524010 we think of it as dose dependent the more the baby gets the more benefit there is if they can make it a year that is wonderful the aap statement also confirms that there is no limit to breastfeeding into the third year of life
4524011 obstacles to initiation and continuation of breastfeeding include insufficient prenatal education about breastfeeding disruptive hospital policies and practices inappropriate interruption of breastfeeding early hospital discharge in some populations lack of timely routine follow up care and postpartum home health visits
4524012 were the biggest problem and the ones who guide the care
4524013 conferences getting online using protocols reaching out to residents and medical students
4524014 doctors need the attitude i feel responsible for making you succeed
4524015 it can keep alive a baby that has no access to breastmilk but is actually fourth on the list of best food choices for baby the first three being breastmilk from the mothers breast breastmilk pumped and given in a bottle and then another mothers milk from a milk bank
4524016 you know you dont have to breastfeed thats why they make formula
4524017 matt what would happen if you acted like an olympic soul winner in training for the next four years
4524018 initiating christian is a delightfully sinful story i was drawn in immediately to the story this is not your typical erotic romance it has a great twist and has the reader rooting for the outcome the sexual encounters are amazing ms wildes never disappoints and as always i look forward to more wonderful stories by this talented author
4524019 this book differs from the rest of the series in that the story is unfolding as we read it rather than being recounted for the enjoyment of the brothers of the absinthe club it is also the sweetest of all the stand alone offerings in the series the ending as well as the rest of the story is delightful this is one ill be reading over and over
4524020 i was amazed with the depth of story and character in so few pages the pace was spot on to be honest this is a sweet story told in a spicy way for me i would like to see more of these and i will definitely look for more books of all length by this author
4524021 i really enjoyed harlee and jakes story they were the perfect match for each other they definitely had chemistry going for them harlee may at times seem ditzy but when she put her mind to something or someone she could be smart about it jake was the ultimate ladies man but when it came to harlee it was like she was back in high school trying to get a first date i thought whos been sleeping in my bed was a great and appropriate title for the story whos been sleeping in my bed was fun whimsical and full of romance jami davenport sure kept my interest going with this story every time i found myself starting to take a break i went right back into reading more before i knew it i was done i cant wait to check out more books by jami davenport
4524022 goldilocks never had it this good i have always loved fairy tales even fractured one whos been sleeping in my bed is a delightful read the characters are superbly written romance suspense and passion fill this book i found a lot of humor in the character of harlee fans of romantica will enjoy whos been sleeping in my bed
4524023 ms davenport starts with two characters each with a past full of heartache and goals that are poles apart the author adds secondary characters that add spice and help tell the background of jake and harlee his brothers sister and parents add great detail to flesh out the story his brother brad adds humor his sister is fun mariah and rico harlees friend and her husband add a challenge as they offer harlee a job that gives her a fall back plan if jake breaks up with her the villain adds his twists and turns to their fate ms davenport uses all her characters to help build the story to an exciting conclusion
4524024 eh there young sporting life bound for lawrenceville step lively
4524025 in the last two or three weeks of the recruiting process there is undue pressure for everybody
4524026 most coaches feel that it is high drama to try to maintain the commitments
4524027 coaches are uncomfortable about asking someone to change his mind when hes made a commitment but until the prospect signs its not official thats the biggest pro among the coaches about why the guys who commit early should be allowed to sign before the regular period
4524028 saucy savvy for clients and colleagues from an industry veteran

4524030 anytime you have immaturity combined with inexperience you have the potential for disaster
4524031 and thats what you get with a 16 year old behind the wheel
4524032 these deaths should not be considered an inevitable part of the teen experience
4524033 adults dont act on all those impulses we sort them but teens have a hard time doing this
4524034 you have a responsibility to make sure your child isnt going to drive into someone else head on because hes busy chatting on his cell phone and nobodys told him hang up the phone and drive the car
4524035 you dont suddenly become a good driver when you turn 16
4524036 we need to ease teens into a lifelong habit of good driving
4524037 its clear that giving young drivers more time behind the wheel with supervision makes a big difference
4524038 statistically we know that somebodys going to leave home and is not going to survive because this bill didnt become law
4524039 when it comes to an infringement on parental rights i get nervous
4524040 but a car crash doesnt just affect the person in the car it affects the people in the car they hit
4524041 if you have a lot of people in the car its really hectic
4524042 you control when your child gets licensed you control the keys and you control the car you can put significant conditions in place
4524043 its the single most effective safety device in your car
4524044 using a phone with a headset is of no benefit to an inexperienced driver

4524190 the whole kempinski team is delighted and honoured to have been chosen as a partner by the st moritz polo ag for this exciting event
4524191 our ambition is to capture the spirit that is bringing millions of chinese domestic visitors to beijing and make london the next obvious choice as a visitor destination we expect visits to london from china to grow by over 300 by 2012 outpacing the growth rates in many of our traditional markets
4524192 adequacy achieved now what the state of education in arkansas 2008
4524193 we are thrilled to be able to provide a forum for sen argue who has been heavily involved in the improvements in arkansas k 12 education over the past decade to reflect upon the changes and give his advice as to where we should move in the future
4524194 what is the state of improvement in arkansas school facilities
4524195 doing your bit for the environment doesnt mean donning tie dye and chaining yourself to the nearest panda
4524196 we all know what we can do in the house for example using low energy light bulbs what may be less obvious is what we can do literally around the house in the yard the garden or the driveway
4524197 if i can help in any way to promote or advance the music program at the university im delighted to do so
4524198 my studies at the university provided the foundation for a most fulfilling and enjoyable career in music
4524199 we are grateful to the mcallisters for establishing this new professorship
4524200 our university deeply values the fine arts and i love to hear stories of students who make a living from their passion much like emily has done her enthusiasm for music is contagious
4524201 bypassed at border inspectors arent using technology claiming laser visas cause backups at international crossings
4524202 you see it was the only workers i could get
4524203 the perils and the promise of comparative constitutional law a comparative perspective on freedom of speech
4524204 domestic legal rules and approaches to common legal problems will increasingly reflect the new globalism
4524205 the question is not whether transnational legal rules will develop but how they will develop and what role the united states will play in their development
4524206 at the end of the day we will participate in the new globalism whether we choose to be active participants in the process or passive recipients of the results of the process
4524207 if we want to affect the content of emerging human rights norms we need to join the conversation even if we do so as defenders or exporters of u s legal norms
4524208 internationalism and free speech are both critically important domains that have received widespread attention but putting them together in the context of what we as americans ought to be doing to ensure our concerns are heard at a global level is nothing short of exciting
4524209 scientists know that endothelial cell dysfunction is a common pathogenic framework of many vascular complications
4524210 for example we know that oxidative stress is a key event in endothelial cell dysfunction but the underlying molecular mechanisms of this process remain poorly understood our investigation will improve this understanding
4524211 she has been able to create a collective feeling of trust and security among everyone associated with the office of greek life
4524212 parice has earned my respect and my confidence to do an exceptional job as the director of greek life
4524213 parice is an amazing counselor and mentor and she is also a role model
4524214 mrs bowser led our greek council by implementing programs that encouraged unity diversity and growth
4524215 she has executed her job with firmness on conduct issues and an understanding of the challenges of managing the large fraternity and sorority chapters on the campus
4524216 we realized pretty quickly that we had a great candidate in parice for the director position this was evidenced by the amount of support that came from current students and alumni members of the ua greek community
4524217 parice is not only a leader in the greek community here at the ua but also is actively serving in several key leadership positions within the profession this bodes well for both parice and the university of arkansas
4524218 i am exceedingly pleased to have someone of ms bowsers capabilities leading greek life at the university of arkansas greek life has played a major role in the transformation of this institution to become a student centered nationally competitive research university
4524219 greek alumni and members make a difference every day on this campus and have provided generous support by way of time talent and treasure greeks are students faculty alumni and benefactors we know that parice is the right person at the right time to continue to steward this system
4524220 i am excited about this opportunity to build upon rich history and tradition within the university of arkansas greek life community i am grateful for the overwhelming support as well as the opportunity to continue the legacy of being a premier greek community among institutions of higher education across the united states
4524221 the fact that our team won in their category is a tremendous confidence booster for our students and is an affirmation that the walton college provides world class education at the awards dinner when the judges announced that our team won first place in the graduate hybrid funds class we were elated and felt proud to represent the walton college
4524222 llewellyn is introducing students to four things an idea of what the law is a technique for reading cases a technique for preparing for class and an understanding that justice in the real world is essential to law
4524223 llewellyn is known as one of the most influential legal realists he believed the law is what people do with rules not just the rules themselves
4524224 this book is important to law students because it was the first to describe the way american lawyers still view what the law really is
4524225 the research for this project was a real treat biography cultural history and a chance to show the reader around the intellectual fights of the roaring twenties
4524226 this was the idea of law that set up the new deal the great society and our current state but it came from the world of freud and holmes great stuff
4524227 my first law school course was based on professor llewellyns lectures it still sets up the habits and skills for lawyers throughout their careers
4524228 as someone who has spent a career in the advancement profession including the last 10 years at the university of arkansas i felt strongly that we needed to get an experienced professional with exhibited success in higher education advancement at the highest levels
4524229 in naming brad choate to this key position weve exceeded that expectation by bringing one of the absolute best in the advancement business to arkansas
4524230 brad is highly respected nationwide has a strong understanding of our goals and where we need to be and will help position the university of arkansas to achieve greater heights in the years ahead im thrilled to be able to work alongside him again
4524231 julie and i are very excited to join the university of arkansas family
4524232 we have had the opportunity to visit the state and university several times over the years and know it to be a wonderful area and institution the university has made great strides forward in the past several years and i am thrilled to be part of an effort to move the university to even higher achievements
4524233 this is a very special time and opportunity for the university of arkansas with dave gearhart becoming chancellor
4524234 i know dave to be a consummate professional and look forward to once again being on his team
4524235 we offered prizes for the residence halls based on how much they collected and also on the efforts they made to educate the students in their hall about recycling and recylemania
4524236 the students really responded over the 10 weeks our moving crew collected and delivered nearly 18 000 pounds of paper cardboard cans and bottles to the campus recycling center
4524237 recyclemania started in 2001 but this is the first time the university was involved
4524238 the results show that people on campus are interested in recycling and making it a competition gives them an extra incentive this was an excellent start the challenge now is to keep the momentum going and continue to increase our recycling efforts
4524239 we want to do even better in recyclemania next year
4524240 how to strengthen both the elementary and the middle school mathematics curriculum in all our schools in order to democratize access to algebra i the gateway course to advanced mathematics and science in our high schools
4524241 basically we spelled out what students must know in order to be able to do advanced math
4524242 we stressed proficiency in such skills as using fractions and decimals so that students dont have to spend time each year on them thats a major reason why textbooks are so huge the publishers are repeating the same information year after year
4524243 math isnt like science or history in which a basic concept is introduced and then expanded upon in later years instead math requires the learning of a sequence of skills students should master the skills they are taught and move on teachers should not constantly have to revisit them because the curriculum did not expect proficiency at the time they were first taught
4524244 we need to look closely at what the state requires of early childhood teachers middle school teachers and special education teachers
4524245 teacher quality will depend to a large extent on what kind of math is stressed in the math courses that these prospective teachers take
4524246 having dedicated math teachers on the elementary level as is now done in middle schools and high schools would solve the never ending problem of how to upgrade the elementary teachers expertise in teaching math
4524247 theres no research on the effect this would have on student achievement so thats why we recommend pilot programs its a question of scale too so that instead of professional development for 300 teachers in a district a core of 25 teachers could focus on math
4524248 a client advised us that i should do the exterior and ati the interior and we could argue where they overlap and that worked out pretty well
4524249 by elevating part of the house we minimized the scale and maximized the yard we dont have a large foot print on the site
4524250 there are crawfish in the creek and weve found arrowheads
4524251 we never have to turn on the lights during the day and ventilation is good too
4524252 we wanted to create a 2 500 square foot space that feels and functions like 4 000 square feet
4524253 everythings to be read as an extension of who we are faucets tiles the wenge wood for the kitchen cabinets
4524254 i feel like the project was successful because were still married and still semi solvent
4524255 bob mcmath has the acumen and versatility that make him a perfect fit for this role
4524256 he has performed superbly in building our honors college from the ground up and his broad career experience in academic affairs and student services certainly make him more than capable of serving as our chief academic officer during this interim period
4524257 i have known bob mcmath for many years from our days at georgia tech and i know he will do an excellent job as interim provost
4524258 in the meantime i know dr gearhart and the search committee will work diligently to find the right candidate to become our next chief academic officer
4524259 im honored and humbled by the responsibility that chancellor white and dr gearhart have asked me to assume
4524260 as dean of a cross disciplinary academic unit such as the honors college ive had the opportunity to work extensively with other deans on campus as well as faculty from a diverse range of disciplines im excited about continuing that dialogue and collaboration on a broader scale within the administration to contribute to the advancement of our academic mission during this interim period
4524261 to put this cut in perspective the fayetteville campus will receive less money from the state next year than it did this year despite the fact that normal inflationary pressures and cost increases specific to higher education have continued to rise
4524262 obviously this unexpected shortfall has forced us to re evaluate our funding plans for the coming year to ensure we are providing appropriate support and educational opportunity and quality for our students faculty and staff under these trying economic circumstances
4524263 we appreciate governor beebe taking a fiscally conservative approach in dealing with the economic challenges facing the state prior to the start of the fiscal year as mid year rescissions are certainly more difficult to address
4524264 we are quite confident that he will do everything he can to ensure that higher education remains strong he knows the future of the state is linked inextricably with the future of the states higher education institutions
4524265 while many states are being chided for delivering fewer resources to the neediest students arkansas lawmakers should be congratulated for supporting a system that provides higher levels of resources to our most disadvantaged students
4524266 adequacy achieved now what the state of education in arkansas 2008
4524267 the results of this study are consistent with the recent positive trend in stories about arkansas schools in the past year or two we have had encouraging reports from our standardized test scores from our advanced placement course participation and now from the perspective of resource provision this is good news
4524268 we are pleased to report that it now appears that the resources are in place and the states leaders have continued to push for high academic standards and rigorous curricula
4524269 now of course the task at hand is for our educational leaders around the state to figure out how to use these resources to meet these challenging standards and foster even greater student achievement for our students
4524270 i asked them to create the andidate from the ground up the name slogan and visual language of the identity
4524271 i then had them use adobe flash to render an animated logo for the andidate followed by some time in second life creating a small branded presence for the andidate
4524272 we need to define policies and procedures that will sustain the gardens for current and future generations
4524273 we want to reaffirm verna garvans mission to preserve these beautiful woodlands while continuing to serve the public we also want to provide research and educational opportunities for our faculty students and the general public
4524274 the biggest challenge we face is overcoming operational obstacles that have developed out of the gardens overall success
4524275 were trying to accommodate the growing number of people who visit the gardens
4524276 but the gardens situation is significantly different than when the plan was developed 10 years ago there needs to be a fresh look at everything
4524277 one of the major functions of the gardens needs to be education
4524278 but it will serve to prepare the gardens even better for impending needs as well as identify the best opportunities for future success we anticipate the results will not only improve services to the general public but enhance many other programs and facilities that fulfill the goals and objectives of the gardens and the mission of the university of arkansas
4524279 as you can see we have many generous contributors to the college and many deserving students
4524280 we are extremely proud of these students and our faculty and staff members enjoy the opportunity to meet them as well as our donors at the annual honors convocation giving benefactors a chance to meet the recipients of scholarships makes for a joyous event that we look forward to taking part in each year
4524281 these are some of the brightest students in their fields and many are practitioners in the education and health fields who have returned to the college environment to enhance their skills with advanced degrees
4524282 i have a sister who has been in the army for four years and it seems like there is a real need for physical therapists in the military
4524283 i could work either in rehabilitation for soldiers returning home or be deployed to travel from base to base i think it will be a great experience
4524284 my mom was a teacher so its in our bloodline
4524285 is that the majority of these people will stay in the area and teach others
4524286 on a professional level this was interesting to me because i hope to work in the back country and wilderness
4524287 personally its important to me to keep the areas i visit pristine and to show respect for the land
4524288 these principles are valuable and necessary with the rising usage of outdoor areas
4524289 this course fits well into the mission of the outdoor connection center and intramural recreational sports program here at the university of arkansas both because were providing a unique educational opportunity that focuses on recreation and because of the principles we are emphasizing
4524290 it also helps our students having the master educator certification on a resume screams hire me
4524291 as an avid outdoor participant and educator she understands the need to develop a quality working relationship with our outdoor recreation partners
4524292 working with organizations such as leave no trace enables our program to effectively nurture this important relationship we hope these kinds of classes are only the beginning of an expanded role in outdoor education in the state of arkansas
4524293 we give student workers 60 to 80 hours of training in recreational programming including wilderness medical training and they run our programs
4524294 these students walk away from the university with great experience and a great skill base
4524295 a lot of people dont know how fragile the back country is
4524296 it isnt that they dont care some just dont know they need to be sensitive to the environment and those seven principles should also be applied to what we call the front country areas such as the city of fayettevilles trail system education can be as simple as teaching people not to feed the ducks because it affects their feeding habits and migration patterns when people are educated they can make the decision to leave the environment as it is for the next person
4524297 while plausible in the case of the adoption stage the assumption that usage is determined mainly by intention may not be applicable to continued behavior
4524298 the assumption ignores the fact that frequently performed behaviors tend to become habitual and thus automatic over time and that is precisely what we found that habit becomes prevalent during the continuance phase and it influences the relationship between intention and behavior this means that in the effort to understand technology acceptance we can no longer assume that only intention will drive actual behavior in predictable ways
4524299 if management wants to promote continued information systems usage behavior it clearly needs to understand what drives it
4524300 we fervently believe that managers will benefit from understanding the nature of habit and habit formation when faced with situations that call for the promotion of certain behaviors
4524301 we want to show off our world class facility and how its spaces can generously accommodate various types of meetings and conferences
4524302 the same vision that drives fulbright college drove diane blair she was committed to supporting research that contributes directly to improving the lives of people in arkansas this conference will help us move closer to addressing and solving some of the most serious problems latinos and blacks struggle with daily
4524303 by understanding the conditions of these two groups we gain a better understanding of how race and ethnicity impact life and opportunity in arkansas
4524304 while the african american and hispanic communities have had very different historical presences in arkansas their full opportunity for participation and self realization is crucial if our state is to reap the benefits of cultural and ethnic diversity today in arkansas as in other parts of the so called new south we have a chance to rewrite history and establish truly new and reciprocal patterns of inter ethnic relations we have much that we can learn from one another
4524305 as such it is not discussed openly in fieldwork settings or otherwise
4524306 cherokees are very enthusiastic about food foraging knowledge and practice in early spring for instance they name and use at least eight different wild mushroom species and various wild onions they are highly familiar with their distinct perceptual features and ecological niches
4524307 they often follow the sacred rule of four that is they locate three of something before they harvest the fourth plant
4524308 the downside is that those who have had correspondence training may be less attentive to plant physiology
4524309 for example herbalists who have learned through traditional training or intergenerational knowledge transmission know that plants found on shady hillsides often have different chemical effects than those found in sunny areas
4524310 keeping the cherokee language alive is an important if not vital link in efforts to keep plant knowledge alive
4524311 linguistic conservation is essential because the plant names are themselves emblematic of cultural knowledge the names are valuable bundles of information
4524312 many of the 68 speakers will be native americans from various tribes
4524313 shawna cain has organized a thursday evening panel discussion of university scholars and native experts the goal of this panel is to address the challenges and opportunities for native groups interested in conserving their languages and ecological knowledge systems
4524314 wal mart is committed to fostering innovation at all levels in our stores and supply chain in our communities and throughout the retail industry
4524315 we created this challenge to give students a forum to showcase their best ideas and to help us learn from some of the brightest minds in the world
4524316 this compelling technology has the potential to have huge ramifications on consumer electronic devices and our environment we are thrilled to be able bring it to a competition of this level wal mart has done a great job of bringing in the best of the best with regards to schools with sustainability acumen
4524317 we are very excited to be competing with teams from some of the top business schools in the u s and britain green technologies are assuming increasing importance in both fortune 500 firms and with entrepreneurial start ups receiving venture capital these teams are proposing the planet changing technologies
4524318 after the shortest fundraiser in the stations history last fall it takes more days of fundraising to reach those listeners who have never given to the station before
4524319 together with the 140 000 raised last fall these funds will provide almost one quarter of kuafs 1 2 million annual budget
4524320 in order to keep a broad and independent base of financial support kuaf must have longer fundraisers to reach those listeners who have yet to become members
4524321 challenge grants allow renewing members to match new member pledges dollar for dollar
4524322 its a great way to make your first gift to the station count for twice as much as you give
4524323 this full day event will give area business professionals a chance to discover the business behind the disney magic
4524324 professional development programs at walt disney resort have been extremely popular last falls program on campus was very successful so we are very pleased to be able to offer it again in arkansas
4524325 participants will discover disney success stories and learn about management philosophies and behind the scenes operations that have made the walt disney world resort a benchmark for businesses around the world
4524326 there will not be a chilled water outage and no buildings will lose their air conditioning
4524327 campus chilled water cooling will be provided throughout the entire planned emergency shut down period and all our other chilled water systems will be running to make up for the loss of one major unit however in places such as computer labs where temperature is critical some precautions may be advisable
4524328 since receiving the 75 000 grant last spring from the investor protection trust foundation we have been able to create these programs to help students become more informed about the world of finance
4524329 in addition these programs teach about managing personal finances and debt
4524330 we are very grateful to the investor protection trust for this grant that makes possible these wonderful educational programs
4524331 we believe that financial literacy programs like these can make a long term impact on the economy of arkansas
4524332 the good news is the money for student loans is out there
4524333 the bad news is that 20 lenders that worked with our students are now out of the student loan business this means students will have to pick new lenders and sign new promissory notes before their loans can go through its primarily a matter of paperwork but it needs to be taken care of before students start fall enrollment before august would be best
4524334 the start of an enrollment period is always very busy for everyone
4524335 if students also have to deal with unexpected loan issues it could be very frustrating were hoping to reach the students early to avoid those problems
4524336 we are always pleased to be included among the best academic schools in the nation by the
4524337 but as the publication points out campus life and culture are also important to prospective students and environmental issues are a significant concern for many of them when choosing a college the university of arkansas has been working very hard to become an environmentally sustainable institution and it is satisfying to see that work recognized
4524338 we are very excited to be able to present such a dynamic program this year
4524339 with ever advancing technology connected consumers a wavering economy and pressures for more environmentally friendly business practices the retail industry has many opportunities to take advantage of these challenges our speakers will address many of these issues and give participants ideas for succeeding in a changing retail landscape
4524340 i favor hard fall off contrast what most people would refer to as
4524341 the work is very simple straightforward and posing is minimal the latter is restricted to turning the subject into or out of the light
4524342 what results is a glimpse beneath the skin a peek at the animal under the surface in essence i am working to remove the masks that we often feel compelled to wear
4524343 up close in the face of my subject at less than arms length
4524344 permission to stare to drink in every line and blemish to stop and smell the rose
4524345 many subjects find it difficult to stare directly into the lens
4524346 we live in a society in which direct eye contact is often considered intimidating verboten unless the eyes regarding each other belong to lovers family members perhaps the optometrist
4524347 remarkable series of poetic sequences filled with honest and unflinching beauty
4524348 lyrical passionate intimate and nervy and they respect the complex reality of love they do not gloss they do not lie they tell the beautiful painful truth
4524349 betty and i realized that nothing special had really been done in fayetteville to celebrate theressa
4524350 we wanted the city of fayetteville to come together and recognize all of her accomplishments so we approached the mayor who was immediately on board the fundraising event was more successful than we imagined and now due to the generosity of the friends of theressa hoover who supported the event and contributed to the concept of establishing a scholarship to honor hoover we are able to start this scholarship fund in her honor
4524351 theressa truly has a new lease on life since the event
4524352 we have been friends since birth and to see her so animated and so alive was a wonderful thing
4524353 the scholarship is a way of saying that even though theressa was unable to go to fayetteville high which would have naturally led her to the u of a for college we can help someone who is able to take that path today
4524354 naming a scholarship after theressa makes sense she is an outstanding role model for todays young people
4524355 they realize that oil is not a long term financial solution and they want to do a better job of educating the populace
4524356 they dont want someone to come in and sell them a model they are interested in having us as a partner to build and integrate a sustainable educational model over the course of time the model will be self sustaining and we can continue to collaborate with them on projects
4524357 we had several broad goals in making the visit including exploring how the institutional research functions of the system and individual campuses monitor store code and retrieve data and subsequently how these data feed back into decision making additionally we looked at how k 12 institutions and systems build data models that can feed into the college system and ultimately how all of that data can be used to improve education across all levels
4524358 i experienced a country being born where there is vigor for investing in life growth and passion to reach out to the world outside for fresh ideas
4524359 the goal of our trip was american uae cultural exchange to pave educational pathways and contribute to mutual economic growth
4524360 that i could see many women students passionate about learning in colleges which is certainly a potential that may tailor the uae society in the years to come
4524361 were excited to welcome sonia jeffery michelle and brooke to the admissions team
4524362 each brings an extraordinary amount of energy to the office and each has already begun to develop strategies to recruit more students to the university
4524363 to share maintain promote and thereby expand library resources and services offered to the students and faculty of the six four year university of arkansas institutions in order to advance learning teaching research service and creativity in the state
4524364 its a pleasure to see so many talented students choose to attend this institution
4524365 not only do the fellows have impressive academic records but they are also very civic minded devoting an amazing number of hours to public service organizations during their high school careers these students will give back to their communities again and again its very rewarding to see the walton familys gift continue to bring students with such enormous energy to our campus to the fayetteville area and to our state
4524366 these students chose the university of arkansas because they dont intend to rest on their laurels they know we will challenge them immediately with compelling course work and community service as well as study abroad and research opportunities
4524367 we want every door open to all our students and we know engagement is critical to their success
4524368 the honors college fellowships program is relatively new yet it is already a nationally recognized scholarship these new fellows will connect with students and faculty who will challenge them to reach higher they are joining a community where engagement in and outside the classroom is a way of life
4524369 canadian national contends that so long as the environment is not affected by the transaction during environmental review the law requires the board to approve the transaction on its competitive merits
4524370 this transaction has far reaching economic and transportation benefits to the chicago region the midwest and the nation as well as for cn and its customers
4524371 given energy volatility margin pressures across the industry and in some case liquidity concerns we would not expect an ease in resin costs to result in competitive pricing actions
4524372 does not appear to be at a level completely commensurate with that of traditional public schools
4524373 given the findings related to the availability of written curricula and teacher qualifications it seems plausible that charter school music instruction may function more as a supplemental activity as a means of integrating instruction or as a tool for reinforcing learning in so called core subjects rather than as a distinct important curricular area
4524374 the political dynamics that unfold during charter school creation and how such dynamics impact decisions about music instruction
4524375 but i do know that music education needs to involve more students offer more ways for students to participate in music and focus on the aesthetic development of the individual
4524376 we are very pleased to be able to offer this scholarship to a boys amp girls club member one of the center for retailing excellences missions is to connect students with the retail industry
4524377 driving a race car involves a lot of things we have to recruit sponsors as the car can cost up to 1 million the maintenance is complicated and involves a lot trial and error of course we use firestone tires
4524378 i drive 220 miles per hour which means i can cover a football field in a minute competing in the indy series is physically demanding i have to run and work out there are all kinds of challenges on and off the course some teams have four cars and 100 people to work on them we have one car and four people but i believe in what i am doing and weve succeeded in spite of the ups and down i encourage you to follow your dreams and persevere at whatever you want to do
4524379 as we continue to deepen our understanding of the relationship among the location of the terrorists home terrorist preparation activities and the target this growing knowledge should help officers prevent and respond to attacks
4524380 major crimes to procure funding for the group like thefts robberies and burglaries however are intentionally committed many miles away to avoid drawing attention to the groups location and target choice
4524381 may be used by agencies to more efficiently patrol known high risk target areas and gather intelligence on suspected actions within a specific distance from potential targets
4524382 the experts ask for a katxi of kalimotxo and dont expect a fancy glass
4524383 bacon pine nuts cheese fried why hasnt this won already
4524384 what about the stuffed pizza skins from uno only in america would you take a deep dish pizza crust and stuff it with mashed potatoes
4524385 apparently there is now something called a p zone from pizza hut that is some combination of pizza and a calzone like maybe one is on top of the other im not really sure but seems appropriate for this
4524386 these students have achieved academic excellence throughout their careers and now they are clearly proving that university of arkansas students can compete with the very best in the country
4524387 we have come to expect at least one fulbright scholar from the university of arkansas each year but to have five scholars in so many different countries really is amazing
4524388 this is a testament to the great support our students receive from the department of foreign languages the study abroad office and many other departments across campus
4524389 even though the students go through a very rigorous application process we have seen the number of students applying for these awards steadily increase over the years
4524390 the students have to be among the best candidates on their campus then in the nation and finally in the country where they are applying to study each step is very competitive and the odds are always long our students persist because theyve seen that other university of arkansas students win these scholarships and that gives them confidence
4524391 what we learned talking to soldiers and mental health professionals affirms the findings of the department of defense health board task force on mental health particularly regarding the stigma attached to psychological problems and the shortcomings in available treatment
4524392 emotions and edgework in the military construction of a post combat self
4524393 the inability to retreat in combat places combat on the far end of the continuum of edgework
4524394 in iraq even the most benign occupation a cook or a company clerk is under threat
4524395 there is no delineated frontline and soldiers are always vulnerable
4524396 there was exuberance and a massive adrenaline rush i never experienced anything like that before because you were scared but never felt so alive
4524397 is seen as an allowable emotion for venting around fellow soldiers
4524398 i was either angry or extremely excited the whole time i was over there anger is good being excited is good being sad and all that can just be swept off to the side
4524399 the ability to get a perspective on ones self is blocked
4524400 the hyper masculine approach that supported edgework in combat also renders the post combat self more precarious
4524401 emotions that were considered necessary in combat become problematic once soldiers return
4524402 military training by its very nature subordinates the self to that of the collective identity of the group persuading soldiers to accept and follow orders given by superiors regardless
4524403 occupational edgework is costly and thousands of soldiers are returning with a post combat self that reflects this reality
4524404 the ap summer institute represents the kinds of partnerships the university continues to build with schools across the state
4524405 these teachers do an amazing job of preparing students for college they are always eager to improve and we want to help them any way we can
4524406 each year entering freshmen bring nearly 3 000 hours of ap credit to the university allowing them to jump ahead pursuing opportunities beyond the normal freshman core these students are more likely to double major study abroad and complete research projects and the great benefit to the student is easy to track
4524407 i am a true believer in ap not only did i receive a years worth of course credit but i was also well prepared for the transition from high school to college the head start allowed me to spend a year abroad
4524408 ap students are being prepared to succeed not just at the college level but well beyond
4524409 ap teachers at the summer institute give students an invaluable head start
4524410 moderate shortage of principal candidates exists in the state of arkansas
4524411 we were looking at the number of openings and applicants and didnt expect to find such a massive rate of principal turnover
4524412 we would be interested in being an educational leader for a school but we dont want the principalship in its current form
4524413 there are fewer applicants for the job of school principal than in past years and the job has become so stressful that people who should become and in past years would have become school principals are saying no thanks but these same people are also telling us that if the job can be changed to make it more reasonable they will then reconsider
4524414 this year our team designed and raced two boats that competed well against those from very strong schools that returned from last year we look forward to having even more successful runs in solar splash 2009
4524415 we have made so many good friends and this is a very special opportunity for us to give to a university we dearly admire
4524416 the amount of drive and perseverance it took to achieve what they have done for the university is impressive the carnall hall alumni scholarship program would not have been as successful without a person like fran to take the lead they are wonderful people and we are thankful for their generosity to the university
4524417 everything i do for the university i have not done alone
4524418 my husband is as much a part of every experience and he is by my side every step of the way the carnall hall successes are the result of teamwork too i had an idea and i had some extra time but we put it all together together
4524419 we have taken the responsibility of this recommendation very seriously
4524420 we have talked to many groups and interested persons on both sides of the equation in an attempt to air all sides before coming to you today we fully understand that not everyone will agree with the recommendation but we have tried to do what is ultimately in the best interests of the university which is our first and foremost responsibility
4524421 while we realize the burden this cost will place on the current student body we strongly believe the purchase of the high school is in the long term best interests of the university and future generations of students
4524422 we think a price of 50 million is reasonable given the scope and age of the facilities
4524423 we believe that the land is in many ways more valuable to the university than the numerous facilities that presently exist and must be maintained
4524424 we know that we cannot utilize all of the space in the immediate future and the acquisition must be viewed as a long term decision it is the purchase of the property contiguous to campus that may be more valuable to us in the long term this value will depend to a large extent on our ability to grow our enrollment and expand our research and public service capacities it is vital that we view this acquisition for a 10 or 20 year term before its benefit can be realized
4524425 we are very aware of the financial burden any acquisition of this magnitude will place on our students due to an increase in fees
4524426 we have carefully weighed this issue and made every attempt to lessen the impact by phasing in any increase in fees to amortize the debt load
4524427 when the answers to all questions are considered together it is apparent that in the united states as a whole and in northwest arkansas people are decidedly more pessimistic about the economy than they were from 2005 through 2007
4524428 for example a may 2008 gallup poll showed that a large percentage of americans 55 percent feel they are worse off financially now than they were a year ago according to one analyst this is the first time in gallups 32 year history of asking the question that more than half of americans gave this pessimistic assessment
4524429 local residents are even more pessimistic about the long term health of the u s economy
4524430 more than half 57 4 percent asserted that the country as a whole will have continuous bad times over the next five years only 22 percent foresee good financial times for the national economy over the next five years the remaining 20 6 percent were uncertain i think this clearly indicates that local residents have some anxieties about the economy
4524431 the star of arkansas is enabling a new level of research at the university of arkansas and across the state
4524432 for example the memory capacity of this supercomputer has allowed one of our researchers to complete a complex job overnight this same task would have taken a year on a regular workstation other projects have been reduced from weeks on a previous supercomputer to days on star of arkansas these are exciting results
4524433 the razorback solar boat team competed very strongly last year and our overall score improved compared to 2006 when we won the championship most significantly for the first time since the university of arkansas began competing in 2000 we came in first place for the sprint race this had been a primary goal in our designs over the last few years
4524434 i think we all get so wrapped up in our day to day lives that even though we care about the problem of missing children we often dont take the time to look at the photos of those kids and commit them to memory
4524435 as researchers we should start working on ways of improving peoples attention to these posters
4524436 the effectiveness of supermarket posters in helping to find missing children
4524437 customers at this store displayed no evidence of memory for the childrens pictures
4524438 this was true regardless of the importance the customers attached to the issue the self reported time spent looking at the pictures and the customers intention to look for the children in the community
4524439 previous research has shown that if you repeat an intention to yourself three times out loud you can dramatically increase doing whatever it is you intend to do
4524440 one mistake we sometimes make is to try to memorize a face in the same way we memorize a string of words
4524441 a string of words you can memorize one word at a time with a face you cant just remember the eyes and then the nose and then the mouth rather faces are best remembered as perceptual wholes you have to take it all in
4524442 if in store marketing can increase sales of sodas and snack chips it seems reasonable to believe that effective approaches can be developed to make the public aware of missing children
4524443 while we were prepared to demonstrate our need for the full amount of our initial request we believe we can operate our system reliably and efficiently based upon this increase in our base rates
4524444 won three of the five awards in this category displaying an unprecedented concern and devotion for improving the quality of their urban environment
4524445 it was delightful to see such thoughtful urban design thinking coming from the academy
4524446 their use of urban design as a sustainability strategy at several scales of intervention affirms the possibilities of the discipline to impact positively the environment and how the earth is inhabited the ua design center is a model that other architecture programs should follow in engaging their host communities
4524447 how a sustainable landscape can blend seamlessly with good urban design and architecture
4524448 multiple opportunities to control the ecological footprint of the campus infrastructure and turn the rivers adjacent surfaces from liability to asset within current political and financial circumstances
4524449 creates cities for humans versus cities for autos with major growth coming this is a chance to do it right from the outset
4524450 these latest awards confirm that our design centers multifaceted collaborative approach to sustainable design is the future of regional and urban planning
4524451 we are proud to offer this resource to our students and the state
4524452 this is good news for the university and for our students
4524453 first this is national recognition that the university of arkansas provides a quality education second it reflects the commitment this state is making to higher education last year the governor and arkansas legislature provided the largest increase in state funding for higher education in 20 years that allowed us to request a tuition increase that was well below the national average which is obviously a factor in our improved rating
4524454 the access arkansas campaign is addressing this universitys need for additional need based financial aid
4524455 the success of this campaign will be a dramatic benefit for our students if that also improves our best value ranking with kiplingers so much the better
4524456 it appears that drinking motives particularly coping motives have promise of providing a greater understanding of the social anxiety drinking relationship
4524457 although social anxiety and drinking are closely related in general society several studies found little or no relationship for college populations
4524458 in the mid to high level social anxiety groups drinking to cope predicted drinking patterns
4524459 when these students said they were drinking to cope then there were more drinking problems
4524460 we had expected that conformity would be more important as it had been in a study from canada
4524461 perhaps conformity is not so strongly associated with social anxiety for drinking in our study the socially anxious who drank for conformity motives werent drinking to excess
4524462 the inclusion of measures that assess reasons not to drink alcohol in addition to reasons for alcohol consumption may better explain drinking for socially anxious individuals
4524463 this year we hope to grow on the success of 2007s event and bring the innovative and oftentimes
4524464 no publisher has won all three awards before congratulations to the university of arkansas press on this unique achievement
4524465 herb fowler was a consummate teacher both a gentle man and a gentleman
4524466 herb was a listener as well as a teacher he would talk to a student and find out what he wanted to accomplish then help him reach his goals
4524467 he brought a special understanding to students about the role of churches and monasteries in medieval life and their role as hospitals and hotels to pilgrims as they made a sacred once in a lifetime journey
4524468 this class of sturgis fellows once again represents some of the most accomplished students in arkansas and in the world they are national merit finalists valedictorians extraordinary volunteers in their communities and exemplary students
4524469 this years class like those before them are articulate and informed bringing an enthusiasm for learning to every class they take as always we are enormously grateful to the sturgis trust for allowing us to attract such outstanding students to the university
4524470 as with every year the talented pool of students we interviewed this year was very deep indeed and so our choices were difficult the spectrum of talent was a wide one and this diversity is amply represented by this wonderful group all of us are looking forward to their arrival here on campus
4524471 these programs bring outstanding students to the university and give them a chance to conduct real research in their fields of interest
4524472 they are also an excellent way to recruit future graduate students because they get to see for themselves the quality of the resources we have here at the university of arkansas
4524473 the publication was devised as a way to keep awareness about sustainability issues high among members of the division and provide ideas that can be implemented on campus and at home
4524474 it has also become a place where the advancement sustainability task force can share the results of its ongoing work making go available campuswide seemed like the next logical step
4524475 this quarterly publication is a good way to keep people in the university community aware of things we are doing here to promote our sustainability goals
4524476 its also a way to pass along information about the everyday things we can all do at home or in the office to be environmentally responsible
4524477 we are looking for all kinds of articles from anyone concerned about sustainability
4524478 we also want to highlight the good efforts of our colleagues and would like to see this newsletter becoming a regular and sustainable publication
4524479 emerged and evolved to reveal patterns of experience and memory
4524480 the university of arkansas is very proud of the fowler house and of the team at flintco
4524481 their team has worked tirelessly to construct a beautiful landmark for our campus that will be used as a gathering place for the arkansas community the house will serve as a focal point for activities promoting and representing the university
4524482 flintco has thoroughly enjoyed being a part of the team that brought this very special project from concept to completion
4524483 and we could not have done it without the hard work and exceptional talent of the architects designers engineers subcontractors and the universitys representatives to receive the abc chairmans award for this project is the icing on the cake for our team
4524484 designing the holy bible arguing the text through the form
4524485 one could say the act of redesigning is ideology through the choices made in type and page layout
4524486 the luther bible is a visual marker of one of the most significant developments in the history of the christian faith
4524487 like you and me people who have crooked teeth and bad skin who have stinky breath and dirty feet
4524488 creating a bible is a tremendous physical creative and courageous task its really fascinating to try to figure out why designers have done it
4524489 we found that in the absence of general knowledge about trans fat especially without a specific understanding that 4 grams of trans fat is high even motivated consumers that is those who consult the nutrition facts panel on food packages and want to know more about the food they eat appear to misinterpret the meaning of trans fat information
4524490 in other words nutritionally motivated consumers lacking appropriate prior knowledge make inappropriate product judgments this is a troubling unintended consequence of the current trans fat disclosure on the nutrition facts panel
4524491 for a majority of consumers basic information disclosure about this lesser known nutrient has a relatively minor impact on product perceptions and evaluations unless there is additional information available to help them better understand trans fat levels
4524492 when consumers were presented with a high trans fat product we found the highest purchase intentions and most favorable nutrition perceptions among consumers who were highly motivated to examine nutrition information but did not have additional information provided to them to help them interpret the trans fat level correctly normally such nutritionally motivated consumers make the best decisions from using the calorie and nutrient information found in the nutrition facts panel
4524493 for motivated consumers these claims can directly offer interpretable information that the product is low in trans fat which influences intentions
4524494 in contrast high levels of trans fat in the nutrition facts panel alone without the percentage of daily value information or other clarifying information were misinterpreted and led to a negative outcome
4524495 we found little evidence that the passage of sox influenced cfo turnover rates implying that internal corporate governance mechanisms were working reasonably well in the pre sox era
4524496 one of the intended effects of sarbanes oxley was greater accountability for cfos
4524497 our study indicates that this intention worked we found that executives terminated in the post sox period have suffered greater labor market penalties compared to the pre sox period clearly a tarnished reputation was more costly for cfos following the passage of sox
4524498 i was meeting with some of my friends in the athletic training program
4524499 and they said they really needed this equipment in order to do their jobs better i was fortunate enough to have the means to help and so i did
4524500 the twu biomechanics program had its own motion analysis system and i got so spoiled
4524501 i wanted a similar system here but because of the limited space available i became more interested in a real time acquisition system the electromagnetic tracking system will allow for a more user friendly system that will yield results much quicker
4524502 there are certain ways of moving that make the person more prone to injury during that movement
4524503 my research focuses on noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injuries and this equipment will allow us to analyze certain movements that may be predictors of injury
4524504 well be able to give coaches and athletes information that will be beneficial to them and their performance while at the same time having elite athletes as subjects is beneficial to my research
4524505 we can also look at movement ranging from development patterns in children to gait patterns in the elderly
4524506 in addition to using the information for injury prevention it will be helpful in evaluating rehabilitation programs
4524507 i have maybe missed one or two games since i graduated
4524508 he looked at me a little funny until i told him it was a thoroughbred then he smiled youd better believe hes the only d mac on the racetrack
4524509 the book is being sold to academics in the field the large numbers of general interest readers who seek out nature and science writing and young people who want to learn more about what the field of biology is like
4524510 these forays into what makes field research fun as well as what makes researchers tick will be sought out by fans of popular science writing
4524511 the stories reveal the exhilaration felt by biologists when discovering new information and collecting new specimens of plants and animals
4524512 the american bar association encourages all law schools to have pro bono programs
4524513 pro bono work not only gives law students excellent experience in their profession but also teaches them to care about their communities
4524514 we grant awards to recognize students who have had outstanding participation in the program we hope those who attend the ceremony will hear the inspiring stories of each of our winners and be encouraged to volunteer their own time doing
4524515 this new classroom will benefit students by exposing them to cutting edge technology used in trials today and will place them in a real world trial setting
4524516 i am a trial lawyer and i want to encourage young lawyers to enter trial practice because the jury is the foundation of our freedom
4524517 the donation to the school of law was a means of helping others as i and both my sons were helped
4524518 it was my privilege and in my opinion my responsibility to give back to the school that helped me so much
4524519 my sons are more than the positions they hold they are men of honor and integrity who respect our system of law
4524520 both my sons have made me very proud of who they are and what they do
4524521 the school of law is fortunate for the friendship and continued support of bobby mcdaniel as one of the best lawyers in arkansas and across the country he exemplifies the professionalism and excellence we hope to inspire in our students
4524522 his life is an example of someone who has not only done well but done good so many have benefited from his dedication to the legal profession and to justice
4524523 these students should be proud of what theyve accomplished in earning this prestigious award
4524524 and we can all be proud of what their achievement says about the university of arkansas other universities that have three goldwater scholars this year include harvard princeton duke and stanford our students have once again proven that the best undergraduates at the university of arkansas can compete with the best students anywhere in the nation
4524525 we have been able to attract top notch students to this university and give them the opportunities to excel thats in part a credit to our outstanding faculty and in part a tribute to the university of arkansas honors college one of the leading programs in the nation
4524526 receiving a goldwater is one of the best things that ever happened to me
4524527 i feel like years of hard work have started to pay off i am so thrilled and honored to receive this award
4524528 after completing my m d ph d degree in neuroscience i plan to conduct biomedical research relating to neurodegenerative disorders particularly alzheimers and parkinsons diseases in addition i hope to treat patients at a medical university
4524529 our faculty are thrilled that rachel and whitneys academic efforts have been recognized with such a prestigious award
4524530 apparently a strong academic record and an enthusiastic involvement in research is a good formula for success as evidenced by the strong goldwater tradition developing in our department
4524531 when i heard the news about the goldwater scholarship i was overjoyed and did not even know what to say
4524532 receiving this scholarship has been a goal of mine ever since first hearing about it at the honors orientation which was even before i started my first class at the university of arkansas i am extremely honored and blessed to be awarded this scholarship
4524533 the fact that one of our students won an award as prestigious as the goldwater is indicative of the quality of engineering students that we work with at the university of arkansas
4524534 as most people in arkansas know the press was co founded in 1980 by poet miller williams
4524535 williamss own poetry has won many awards and he is probably best known for reading at bill clintons 1997 inauguration
4524536 he began the press with a strong focus on poetry and he discovered several poets who have gone on to successful careers including two time united states poet laureate billy collins who published his first book with williams in 1988 that book the apple that astonished paris is still our best selling poetry title
4524537 it places us more solidly among nationally recognized poetry prizes and will help us attract even more outstanding manuscripts
4524538 i have been engaged with several departments in the college of education and health professions teaching in an adjunct capacity and working on projects and research this was a chance for me to do some payback
4524539 our colleges students and graduates touch many lives across arkansas im excited to be part of preparing the next generation of educators and service providers
4524540 over 30 years we touched bases in a lot of places
4524541 the college and other parts of the university have been an incredibly rich resource for the community and ozark guidance
4524542 working with the fifteen for the future committee was a great start for me
4524543 it gave me the chance to meet a wonderful brain trust of faculty members and department leaders who care tremendously about the university and its students
4524544 david williams is a dedicated professional who has guided the development of an exceptionally strong array of mental health services for our region
4524545 in addition he is widely respected across the state and nation we know david as a caring leader who will bring the experience knowledge and skills that we continually seek in our college as an executive in residence he will bring both wisdom and commitment to the classroom his department and the college
4524546 the two entities are exploring short and long term collaborations
4524547 right now were concentrating on sharing the old wrmc facility trying to make things work and to be sure that needs are met weve also been brainstorming and there are a lot of possibilities when you think five 10 years down the road
4524548 theres a diversity of ideas and people that is extremely attractive to me not only the kind of things that stretch my mind but also the collegial discourse people with strong differing opinions work together and respect each other thats attractive lifes not very interesting when everybody is alike heres a place that is genuinely making diversity a strength
4524549 we can collaborate more inside the college and with other university entities and with community state national and international entities
4524550 i am very grateful for this opportunity to be a part of the college it has been a wonderful transition from my work at ozark guidance
4524551 carrollton is excited to open these five new soccer fields for play
4524552 we feel the new fields are a great addition for our residents and something our soccer community will truly enjoy
4524553 the recreational amenities were created to promote team sports and physical fitness and meet the long term needs of carrolltons soccer community
4524554 the soccer fields are being constructed in conjunction with several other current and future enhancements at the mcinnish athletic complex including a turf replacement on existing soccer fields new baseball fields new playgrounds and a new restroom
4524555 could create opportunities for students to interact with other students from different racial backgrounds in the hopes that they might develop friendships over time
4524556 we asked the hard questions because we thought it was important to know what the data says to know what to do about it
4524557 our research confirms the understanding that every culture has something to offer
4524558 you learn more from people who are different than from people who are the same as you and echo your ideas
4524559 tell el amarna was briefly the capital of ancient egypt during the reign of the pharaoh akhenaten who abandoned most of egypts old gods in favor of the aten sun disk and brought in a new and more expressive style of art
4524560 this means that we have a period of deprivation in egypt prior to the amarna phase
4524561 independent nursing study on the care of breast cancer patients
4524562 looking beyond essential needs using the personhood model to improve dementia care in nursing homes
4524563 weve been working with nick brown executive assistant for sustainability at facilities management for the past several months
4524564 he helped us develop a series of ways the bookstore can contribute to the universitys efforts to become a sustainable academic institution were excited about the opportunities well have to make a difference
4524565 sourcing and new market development in the global supply chain
4524566 we are very pleased to receive this grant to provide investor education to university of arkansas students as well as to junior high and high school teachers and minority high school students
4524567 the information conveyed to freshmen and public school teachers will not only raise their awareness about the importance of financial planning and establishing a personal savings and investment program but also reduce their susceptibility to fraud by making them more knowledgeable consumers of financial products and services in addition we want to interest non business students younger students and teachers in finance and business
4524568 saving lives creating hope americas response to the global hiv aids crisis
4524569 do seem to share a conventional wisdom that maybe the governor had an overdeveloped sense of entitlement
4524570 in his heart of hearts i think he is just slightly right of center he doesnt want to soak the rich but hes from a state with a lot of poor people so he doesnt want to soak them either hes pragmatic i would be surprised in fact if some of what he is saying now he doesnt abandon after the primary season as a little more regressive than he really is
4524571 it is truly an honor and privilege to have the armys senior medical officer officiate this ceremony more importantly as the chief of army nursing maj gen pollock is here to recognize the fact that the university is producing its first army nurse through rotc this is an important milestone in the long and storied history of the razorback brigade
4524572 these five young men and women represent all that is great about arkansas and the university
4524573 they have all done a little bit more than most college students and are now beginning the next phase of their life where they will be charged with leading americas sons and daughters during a time of war they have the education and leadership required to be successful
4524574 hosting the rotcs commissioning ceremony is an honor for the law school community it is a chance for us to strengthen our relationship with the rotc program celebrate the achievements of the five graduates and also remember our school of law alumni who have served in the u s military
4524575 it was a joy to see how these kids minds work because they all came up with different ideas they did an excellent job
4524576 the students helped us visualize what the project could look like
4524577 heres a large landscape that is an eyesore with a 900 foot long bridge that is dirty and greets visitors with peeling paint but theres an opportunity here to turn west memphis into a memorable gateway to the state of arkansas
4524578 roundabouts have a great safety record almost zero fatalities and they give you an opportunity to install a monumental feature that can become a focal point
4524579 we realized that a roundabout wouldnt work there but we did get a dialog going between landscape architects and civil engineers
4524580 in the real world this is how projects change over time
4524581 its good for the students to see this process at work
4524582 now were going to tighten the program and detail it in preparation for future work with professional architects landscape architects and engineers
4524583 we hope to create an icon that celebrates the gateway concept in the next phase
4524584 the west memphis project is a great example of students bringing their ideas and enthusiasm into a community to create real change
4524585 its great when our students have the opportunity to learn work with people in other disciplines and help out the state
4524586 private gift support is essential to the success of the school of law
4524587 we are committed to providing an exceptional legal education to our students and the generosity of alumni business leaders and friends of the university help make this possible the important work of the development director provides the school with a solid outlook i am thrilled to welcome teresa to our team and the law school community looks forward to working closely with her as we plan for the future
4524588 teresa brings a wealth of knowledge to the university of arkansas
4524589 she has extensive experience managing law school fundraising communications research and special events our school of law is already a top program and teresas background will only encourage this level of success to continue she is a great addition to the school of law and to the university of arkansas
4524590 i am delighted to be joining dean nance and the university of arkansas school of law at such an exciting time
4524591 the school of law is a vibrant and thriving legal institution and i look forward to building a long and rewarding partnership with the law school and its loyal and committed alumni
4524592 once they brought their families established a permanent home in the united states became consumers and sent their children to u s schools the possibility if not always the dream of returning to mexico became increasingly unrealistic
4524593 this is partly because being from santo domingo no longer requires being from santo domingo
4524594 exactly who belongs to the community how santo domingo is understood as a place and identity has become more flexible
4524595 being from santo domingo may not matter so much in mexico for immigrants who no longer live there but it remains very important for surviving life in arkansas
4524596 that the humiliation hard work and sacrifice were worth it
4524597 creating and reproducing social relationships that support life in the united states
4524598 santo domingo and the trip home more generally is important because it provides a relatively safe place physically imaginatively and culturally where immigrants can form alliances networks and understandings that sustain and facilitate their partial incorporation into the united states
4524599 neither here nor there mexican immigrant workers and the search for home
4524600 living the dream in the 21 st century where do you stand
4524601 we are very pleased that the quality and innovation of the documentary has been further recognized
4524602 its even more satisfying that this film has resulted in a broader understanding of silas hunts contribution to diversity
4524603 the silas hunt documentary serves as an educational tool to spread the word of the rich history we have here at the university
4524604 it symbolizes our previous and ongoing commitment to diversity we are very proud of all the accolades and attention the documentary has received
4524605 these homes have great curb appeal but a small number of their owners are sleeping on futons and eating off of tv trays because they cant afford to furnish them
4524606 buying a home is a risky process but because it is our single largest lifetime investment many people see it as the only way to build equity in their lives and create an asset of value
4524607 and its been pushed so much on us as an important value that its very hard not to buy
4524608 in general if your house payment is more than 28 percent of your gross monthly income youre already pushing the maximum limit the average family can pay
4524609 now thats just the house payment which includes principal interest taxes and insurance youre also going to have utilities repairs and other associated costs
4524610 the average person who is moderately successful and can keep their house probably spends about 35 percent of their gross monthly income on total house related expenses but if youre paying more than 30 percent of your monthly gross income just on a house payment youre borderline to be successful because historically thats where foreclosures begin their classic climb
4524611 remember the agent is working for the seller not the buyer
4524612 its like when you go to a car dealership to buy the base model but the first thing the salesman shows you is a tricked out model you need to say no in those types of situations
4524613 there are a few real estate brokers out there very few who are legally bound to be the buyers spokesperson
4524614 they are intermediaries between the consumer and the agent and the seller it adds a little bit of cost upfront but in the long run theyll save the buyer money because its their job to negotiate the best price and the best deal
4524615 most people are not very good negotiators were not willing to walk away from a bad deal because at a certain point most of us get so emotionally attached to a certain property that we wont get up and walk away but we should
4524616 i think you should have a down payment so you have a sense of investment
4524617 i think you should certainly go with a fixed rate and read the fine print if you dont want to look at all those pages its a good idea to have a lawyer look at it someone who specializes in real estate or lending law it will cost you some money but it may save you a lot in the future
4524618 several other candidates were considered as well but there was outstanding support for kattie both in the campus community and on the search committee she is very respected statewide is developing a national reputation as well and she brings a unique degree of institutional memory to the position
4524619 i am thankful that i can play a small part in fulfilling student dreams by reducing their financial burden and supporting their future i love to stand outside hunt hall and watch students pass by going to and from class wondering what they will accomplish with their education
4524620 the success of this years campaign speaks volumes about the universitys commitment to northwest arkansas and the spirit of philanthropy that inspires individuals across campus to respond to the needs of those who are in medical financial or economic distress
4524621 i am very proud of the generous spirit of giving of the students faculty and staff during this years united way campaign
4524622 student participation provided an extra spark to the campaign this year
4524623 they not only raised money but they also raised awareness of how student donations enable united way agencies to provide essential services to people in need in northwest arkansas i particularly appreciate the efforts of the associated student government the division of student affairs and registered student organization leaders in making this happen
4524624 their generosity was simply amazing setting new records in terms of dollars raised and the number of employees participating since they are the largest department on campus we rely on their support and giving during this campaign they also held a pie throwing contest and a jeans day which raised additional funds
4524625 we plan to carry out strategic demolition and prepare the site for construction if time permits we may build some of the new interior walls
4524626 this blitz build takes us one step closer to getting miss gloria back in business
4524627 several judges commented on the high quality of the people and programs that were nominated this year
4524628 we want the university and northwest arkansas communities to understand that people in the division are doing more than talking about diversity
4524629 there are people who are doing things every day to make the university a more inclusive community and by recognizing that work we hope to inspire more people to get involved
4524630 because of his american with disabilities act training and the fact that his conversation partner is a student with disabilities and requires a wheelchair bill approached me about converting one of the desks in the computer lab to an ada compliant workstation
4524631 he is using his training to make much needed improvements to our student working area
4524632 previous research looked at management capacity and adoption of innovative practices
4524633 our research was the first to use quantitative methods to examine management capacity and the implementation and diffusion of innovation
4524634 contrary to the performance literature that claims a strong tie between stable leadership and performance new leaders willingness to take risks for new projects with fresh perspectives rather than their years of experience decided the success of innovation implementation
4524635 played a significant role in the implementation of agency innovative programs
4524636 unexpectedly our findings did not confirm the value of evaluation and feedback systems in the implementation of innovative programs
4524637 reduce the uncertainty about the quality of innovations and increase a chance to be adopted by other agencies because of their proven quality
4524638 consistent communications with multiple stakeholders using such tools as media publications and the internet would increase understanding about new behaviors and bring political support for the change
4524639 being recognized by the bacchus network as the 2007 outstanding affiliate for excellence in peer education programs further validates the accomplishments and awesome work done by respect since its beginnings in january 2000
4524640 it is truly an amazing accomplishment to be awarded such an honor for a program that is relatively young among all of the peer education programs on college campuses across the nation the award exemplifies that respect is a premier group paving the way with ongoing innovative and effective programming
4524641 leadership on sustainability issues is an integral part of the universitys role
4524642 this initiative is essential if we are to prepare our students our community our region and our state to be mindful stewards of the environment a comprehensive approach like this is also needed if the university of arkansas expects to compete successfully in any number of areas on a national basis today and in the future
4524643 universities public and private rural and urban large and small at which hispanic students are thriving
4524644 the university of arkansas is committed to creating and maintaining an environment that is inclusive of all people and one where all students of culturally diverse backgrounds will feel comfortable
4524645 it is encouraging to see that a publication like the hispanic outlook is recognizing the efforts that have been made by our university community in the past and also its commitment to creating a more diverse campus for all cultures including hispanic students
4524646 hispanic enrollment in higher education the actual headcount increased immensely over the last decade far more than that of any other racial ethnic minority a recent american council on education report shows a 67 percent jump between 1994 and 2004 and a 73 percent increase at four year institutions that is splendid news and our institutions deserve applause for accommodating and enabling that increase
4524647 we are very pleased to have dr callahan represent the college and the academic community on this prestigious council she was nominated by the executive council of the american accounting association this is a prime example of connecting scholarship with practice
4524648 it has been my aspiration to go well beyond the call of duty to serve the university of arkansas and the walton college well during my tenure i am grateful for the national respect and support of my academic peers as well as the accounting profession that this unanticipated honor conveys
4524649 both have a lot of experience with classical music listening playing and evaluating
4524650 by contrasting two instrumentalist subgroups we make the genetic predisposition explanation less likely and strengthen the case for training
4524651 musicians brought a special network of responses to music they had had specific experiences with
4524652 because this specific experience includes experience producing the sound not just listening to it and experience evaluating it musicians are particularly invested in assessing the quality of performances on their instrument some of the brain activation suggests that they could detect more subtle differences in sound when listening to their instrument of expertise
4524653 perhaps musical experience needs to be less passive and more active
4524654 perhaps we need to connect music more with other domains of activity
4524655 selective neurophysiologic responses to music in instrumentalists with different listening biographies
4524656 land of unequal opportunity documenting the civil rights struggle in arkansas
4524657 arkansas has a long and remarkably complex civil rights history
4524658 during world war ii 16 000 japanese americans mostly american citizens were incarcerated in relocation camps in arkansas adding a unique aspect to our collective civil rights history
4524659 global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions is the ber ubiquitous issue of our times
4524660 it influences and is influenced by business practices technological choices our philosophical relationship to the planet and personal habits our management of this single issue more than any other will define the quality of life for our descendants participation in focus the nations teach in is one of many steps that the university will take in the coming year to address this issue
4524661 drying in one year is not necessarily the same as drying in another year
4524662 the dynamics of these systems where you have regular drying has become increasingly important to understand because of global climate change
4524663 we found that certain abiotic factors such as pool depth and total volume are important to the fish and the species diversity and density in the system
4524664 however what happens one year isnt necessarily going to happen the next year
4524665 there are a lot of subtle and complex interactions when a stream dries
4524666 what is the significance of black history month and why is it important to celebrate it on the u of a campus
4524667 the world is my home the life and times of paul robeson
4524668 focus on the story how to conceive develop write and sell without an agent
4524669 rohm is one of the leading semiconductor companies in the world and we are extremely pleased to be one of their strategic partners in this area
4524670 our two years of analysis of test data in acpp schools in little rock reveal consistent findings students of teachers who are eligible for performance bonuses enjoy academic benefits further many of the criticisms of merit pay programs simply have not proven true in little rock
4524671 we regret this unfortunate circumstance but the foo fighters are committed to playing a sold out show in fayetteville
4524672 the conference is designed to inspire and empower working women to take a leap into personal and professional success
4524673 we are providing motivating speakers relevant break out sessions and networking opportunities at the conference
4524674 it is a wonderful starting point for us and it sets the standard for the quality of shared academic programs that will be launched through this consortium in the coming years
4524675 this is truly a win win proposition for the university of arkansas system
4524676 our students and ultimately the state and nation will benefit from this partnership to increase the quality and number of health care professionals educated at the university of arkansas
4524677 the university of arkansas for medical sciences invited us to participate and the central administration at the university of arkansas has supported our efforts to explore this option
4524678 this arrangement would benefit our nursing students providing them the opportunity to become part of a larger health education system and to develop working relationships with students in the medical pharmacy and allied health fields
4524679 we are excited about the university of arkansas mann school of nursing joining us as a partner at our health education satellite campus
4524680 having their program under one roof with the uams college of nursing graduate level nursing programs should lead to increased numbers of nursing grads with advanced degrees who can become professors in nursing schools around the state
4524681 we agree this arrangement with uams would also appeal to potential nursing educators and hiring additional educators will help us continue to expand nursing enrollment in the mann school
4524682 with compressed interactive video capabilities lectures in little rock can be broadcast in fayetteville and vice versa just one of many ways faculty of the two campuses can collaborate nursing and medical students can also share some of the simulation equipment such as computerized mannequins that are very expensive
4524683 with the cost of land and space it made tremendous sense to try to utilize the old hospitals facilities
4524684 its very expensive to build the type of space that accommodates laboratories these nursing students need to be prepared for todays health care needs the move would also allow our speech and hearing clinic to increase the number of clients seen
4524685 we have assembled an outstanding panel of law school graduates who will comment on their experiences in educational and social settings that have been affected by racial integration
4524686 this is an opportunity to learn about the universitys integration history and to hear first hand accounts of the struggles and successes of our graduates i think silas would be proud of the progress weve made since he was a student
4524687 this historically significant event recognizes the efforts of silas to break down racial barriers and to open the door for other african american students to earn a legal education
4524688 but it also celebrates the strides made in each decade since his admittance and the accomplishments and triumphs of all minority students
4524689 mary lib and i recognize the great importance of raising money for need based support at this university and we are thrilled to contribute to the access arkansas initiative
4524690 many students struggle to meet the financial obligations of attending college and each access arkansas scholarship will help to ease that burden for one or more of our very capable and deserving students
4524691 i am grateful to john and mary lib for their gift to access arkansas
4524692 by contributing to this initiative they are leading by example need based support is undoubtedly a top priority for our institution and this generous gift is evidence of a high level commitment to the purpose of access arkansas
4524693 we are very pleased with the progress and we are on track to meet the ambitious goal set for this fiscal year
4524694 last years totals exceeded 100 million and we are well on our way to another fantastic year of securing private gift support that is so critical to this institution
4524695 im grateful to the alumni and friends and the corporations and foundations who have contributed to our efforts already this year
4524696 i am extremely appreciative of the work of the individuals who raise money for current and future initiatives of the university our volunteers including the board of advisors generously give their time for the betterment of our university new initiatives such as the need based scholarship program access arkansas depend on the generosity of benefactors to be successful this university is grateful to have so many people who believe in its mission and i am delighted to see such tremendous support continue year after year
4524697 as many people know wind generated power has been used in europe for quite some time
4524698 but recently the united states has led the way by installing more wind capacity annually than any other country on earth as of the end of 2007 the united states was expected to have installed more than 15 000 megawatts of wind energy capacity which has the potential to replace approximately 30 million pounds of carbon emissions per hour at full capacity production
4524699 expanding manufacturing locations closer to the united states will shorten the supply chain
4524700 it will provide less expensive turbines to the country with the fastest growing wind energy capacity it will also allow companies to develop projects in countries where wind energy has not yet become popular
4524701 transportation management in the wind industry problems and solutions facing the shipment of oversized products in the supply chain
4524702 this is cutting edge research with strong potential for short term and long term dividends in economic development
4524703 the world is watching these arkansas scientists and this research can lead to high quality knowledge based jobs for arkansans
4524704 as many people know the university of arkansas has emerged as a national center of excellence in nanoscience and nanotechnology research
4524705 this generous grant acknowledges the many and profound achievements of our engineers and scientists who have looked far beyond the boundaries of their disciplines and made great strides toward improving and developing tools that will improve our lives
4524706 investments in faculty and facilities in nanoscience and technology are key to educating science and engineering students who are prepared for the many challenges our society will continue to face in the next several decades
4524707 this investment by the state will play a key role in incubating new technology based businesses in arkansas and will go a long way toward attracting more federal research funds
4524708 i can identify with students who struggle to get the necessary funds to finish school
4524709 im now in a position to help out and i want to make a difference for those deserving students who might be on the fence and barely able to hang on maybe my gift will help to keep someone in school and earn a degree
4524710 my involvement with the walton college helped me to become better informed about the reasons students drop out of college
4524711 many students are caught between being at the top of their class and wondering how they are going to pay for the next semester
4524712 i greatly appreciate mr laucks involvement with the walton college and his dedication to the university and our students
4524713 he has a personal connection to the access arkansas initiative and he understands the challenges many of our students face this gift will open new doors and create new opportunities for students who need help fulfilling the financial obligations of earning a degree
4524714 it is important that students get the opportunity to do real hands on research as undergraduates and the surf awards make that possible
4524715 the grants also build strong student faculty partnerships needed to meet the universitys commitment to both research and teaching the range of the research being done is also impressive everything from the humanities to hard science
4524716 conducting research as part of the undergraduate program is critically important for students who plan to go to graduate law or medical school
4524717 but it also gives students a competitive edge when they are looking for a job today having research experience is as important as having good grades and scores this innovative state program really puts arkansas students ahead of their peers in other states
4524718 the book covers instrumentation laser lighting control panels the broad range of lighting applications
4524719 use daylight its common sense the sun gives off 10 000 footcandles of light the fluorescent fixture above my desk just 50
4524720 we try to avoid indiscriminate general illumination that accomplishes little in aesthetic appeal wastes energy and offers no flexibility its on or off
4524721 the challenge with led is that these lamps are not yet as efficient to see with though they are very effective for signaling for use in brake lights for example
4524722 researchers are making major breakthroughs so that the technology will soon be applicable for widespread use
4524723 its no longer a matter of interest its a reality theyre aware of the importance of sustainable design and theyre trying to get ready for it
4524724 today i try to bring the two together in the minds of my students
4524725 you have to understand the technology and the technology has to be put to the service of design either one alone is not architecture
4524726 why this person should be honored as a member of the arkansas business hall of fame
4524727 the columnar shape was selected based on our research into historic photographs and drawings for the greek theatre
4524728 the trees were originally lombardy poplars which have numerous problems that led us to choose a different yet similarly shaped species we are very concerned with respecting the heritage of our campus landscape and we take the stewardship of campus trees and landscapes very seriously we have planted over 3 500 trees on campus since the early 1990s and we carefully consider any decision to remove any trees
4524729 i am really privileged to have a group of peers and students who think enough of my teaching to nominate me for this award
4524730 i was humbled when i thought about the company i was in considering the previous recipients of the award
4524731 he is a remarkable teacher he is an accomplished education scholar and he is tireless in his service to the educational mission of his profession his university and his department
4524732 we are very proud of norms extraordinary dedication to providing the best education possible for our students
4524733 the issues that combined so explosively in little rock in 1957 continue to roil american politics and law that is why americans continue to study what happened there for some insight into who we really are and where we are headed in this new century
4524734 raises important questions about the broader thrust of the civil rights movement and the nature of its achievements
4524735 a mesmerizing and brave book a story with complicated layers and meaning for all americans a heroic saga of progress and its consequences
4524736 new light on the role of women in the crisis
4524737 we are so proud of jennifer maegan and sierra for this exciting recognition from a prestigious national scholarship program
4524738 these three students are remarkable young women who have not only the commitment to participate in the upward bound programs but whose drive and determination will lead them to great success in college and beyond
4524739 senior managers continue to question whether their firms are spending too much or too little on it
4524740 we believe that our ability to model it budget levels contingent upon a set of environmental organizational and technological factors will help cios and cfos evaluate and set their it budgets based on a variety of industry and firm contextual factors rather than a percentage of sales
4524741 since both of these components were positively associated with performance
4524742 we believe that the contextual factors while beneficial to cios and cfos do not provide a complete explanation of the value of firms information technology expenses
4524743 this is a positive action that will ensure equitable increases for classified staff to help alleviate some of the burden they face from rapidly rising cost of living pressures
4524744 we continued throughout the week to discuss the possibility of implementing our original plan and were greatly appreciative of the states efforts to clarify the matter and for deferring the decision to us regarding salary increases while it is regrettable that some confusion has ensued due to the different plans on the table during this difficult budgeting process in the end were happy to be able to move forward with the proposal we initially sought as having the most significant impact upon our people
4524745 were very pleased to hear of this development and we appreciate dr gearhart keeping the staff senate and university community informed
4524746 we are pleased that university administrators proposed this improved pay plan for classified employees and continued to work diligently to secure state approval until it was authorized
4524747 we particularly appreciate the persistent efforts of chancellor elect gearhart and vice chancellors don pederson and richard hudson we look forward to a cooperative and productive relationship with the administration to strengthen our institution and advance the best interests of faculty staff and students
4524748 weve chosen to put our people first albeit within our stretched means in the coming year
4524749 while new programs that can enhance our quality and service to the state are critical and we hope to address those as soon as our funding outlook improves what makes a great university are its people in order to continue to recruit and retain the best faculty and staff to serve our students they need to be our priority even when difficult budget choices need to be made
4524750 im greatly appreciative for having been honored in this way by my alma mater
4524751 i would like to thank my many colleagues over the years who helped make this recognition possible
4524752 the center for business and economic research is so pleased to be able to bring mr bullard to northwest arkansas
4524753 it is very important that local business and community leaders get the chance to hear about important economic issues from national level policy makers
4524754 the quarterly business analysis program exists to help community and business leaders obtain the knowledge that will help them make informed decisions
4524755 we are very proud to receive this award and recognition from the national science foundation
4524756 we are delighted that the video is bringing national awareness to such a wonderful program here at the university of arkansas
4524757 one of our primary objectives is to help students learn how to put classroom learning into practice in the real world we are very proud of the winners and the work they put into creating these exciting business plans
4524758 this software will make electric power plants more cost effective and reduce the amount of fuel they need to generate electricity
4524759 these business plan competitions do a lot to promote entrepreneurship here in arkansas this win will be so motivating to our incoming graduate classes the walton college is developing many programs to encourage more entrepreneurial thinking among our students
4524760 lalit verma has shown what he can accomplish as an academic leader he helped to build a relatively small department into a vibrant and growing program
4524761 he will bring these same leadership skills to bumpers college during this interim period i am grateful to dr verma for accepting this important interim position
4524762 dr verma is respected as a researcher and student mentor in both academic and agricultural extension settings he knows the importance of agriculture to the state of arkansas and the importance of the students in bumpers college to the future of our state
4524763 i am confident that his leadership will keep bumpers college moving forward during this interim period
4524764 dr verma has provided outstanding leadership in his department to match his contributions to his profession we look forward to working with him in his new role
4524765 i look forward to working with all of my colleagues in our exceptional bumpers college faculty together we will continue to improve and promote agriculture in arkansas in the nation and in the world
4524766 i really feel honored and excited to be getting this kind of exposure for the podcast an endorsement really from the maa
4524767 the math factor is made for people of all ages who are engaged by mathematical thinking who enjoy the stimulation of mathematical ideas so many more of them will be able to find us on the maa web site
4524768 i feel it is important that this is math journalism or math entertainment not exactly math education although i am always delighted when i can get some real math instruction onto the radio
4524769 kyles last math class was high school geometry but he is an excellent interviewer very bright and very curious
4524770 i know from my own experience that there are people who are looking for a place that offers mathematical nourishment i dont consider myself much of a writer but i enjoy talking about mathematical ideas and trying to make them clear to my non mathematical friends so having the format of the podcast is amazingly fortuitous as far as i know at this moment the math factor is unique i expect that will change probably soon and if this podcast can provide some inspiration so much the better
4524771 symmetry and pattern are fundamentally human preoccupations in the same way that language and rhythm are any culture that is making anything has ornament and is preoccupied with this visual rhythm
4524772 there are actually neolithic examples of many of these patterns the fish scale pattern for example is 22 000 years old and shows up all over the world in all kinds of contexts
4524773 were also able to say things that other people might not be able to say
4524774 is meant to be engaging and reveal itself visually as well
4524775 were trying to understand what inherently can be described in a quantitative analytical way
4524776 conway is one of the best notation makers in the world
4524777 a good notation is amazing because its not just a way of naming things its a way of making the structure of things transparent and simultaneously providing a way of enumerating them classifying them and proving thats what the classification is all at once thats really the big exciting thing
4524778 had been preaching the gospel of the orbifold signature on his own and was known for his gorgeous illustrations
4524779 why would the fish scale pattern be so compelling and so interesting and be the basis for all kinds of other patterns its very easy because it has a very simple orbital
4524780 you want to get to a simple pattern on an orbifold when you do that then the pattern is strong and dynamic
4524781 weve chosen to put our people first albeit within our stretched means in the coming year
4524782 while new programs that can enhance our quality and service to the state are critical and we hope to address those as soon as our funding outlook improves what makes a great university are its people in order to continue to recruit and retain the best faculty and staff to serve our students they need to be our priority even when difficult budget choices need to be made
4524783 salaries at the university particularly those earned by classified staff continue to lag anywhere from 15 to 40 percent below those offered at peer institutions when adjusted for market conditions
4524784 clearly we cannot afford to lose any more ground when it comes to compensation for our people
4524785 the state funding outlook has meant weve had to make tough decisions on how tuition dollars will be deployed
4524786 we think that as a people intensive organization this is the most appropriate fiscal plan we are grateful to governor beebe for his conservative budget approach which provided us ample time to make adjustments we have been able to ensure that the people who make the universitys mission work are not the ones who bear the brunt of this funding shortfall
4524787 te vas a levantar a las 6 para ver tal cosa
4524788 we must always be cognizant of our students and the burden we place on them when considering future tuition increases and certainly we are keeping the students in mind when balancing our need for resources and future development
4524789 the cost of a university of arkansas education is well below average and among the lower half of flagship schools nationally
4524790 this is a testament to our ongoing efforts to run a lean efficient university even with tuition and fees of 6 400 annually the university of arkansas will not be the most expensive public institution in the state and the cost for students is expected to be at a reasonable level compared with other institutions around the state
4524791 when we are unable to attract top faculty to campus we are shortchanging our students in terms of the quality of education they should expect from a flagship institution
4524792 mr kesselmans visit is an important and timely event for the center and the university community
4524793 whether youre a consumer farmer researcher policy maker or otherwise the issues he deals with are of great significance to the nation
4524794 mr kesselman is a well respected attorney throughout the nation and it is an honor to have him here at the school of law
4524795 his presentation will be a unique opportunity to hear from a leading agricultural official who is at the heart of the important issues facing the country
4524796 even as a small boy i could see that the design of housing has a pretty direct impact on peoples lives
4524797 weve got to provide a healthy environment where people can live and bring up their kids
4524798 recent studies show that pocket parks and communal hang out spaces can help gel communities
4524799 theyre not a frivolous bit to add to a housing scheme but fundamental to the long term success of the development
4524800 its a way for landscape architects to assess their work and can be used as a guide as you design
4524801 open spaces can be used for play seating an orchard composting
4524802 a road is not just a conduit for cars but a place where kids can play and people meet
4524803 they provide so much value but theyre often left out
4524804 trees have to be thought about right from the beginning where theyre going to go how big theyre going to get and whether root barriers are needed
4524805 ultimately sustainable design is not about the environment its about people
4524806 i get a kick out of designing spaces where people are going to spend a significant amount of time
4524807 we want to help architects understand that they have the ability to manipulate software to make what they want
4524808 computational design enables architects to torque twist and mold buildings testing all along to see how much they can warp form while retaining sound structure
4524809 there have been computational design workshops at georgia tech mit and ucla none of them anywhere close to this part of the country
4524810 the tutors will step participants through a series of exercises then turn them loose on their own projects
4524811 olivia meeks has more than earned this honor through her strong intellect her hard work her wide ranging interests and her boundless energy
4524812 her academic accomplishments are obvious but she has also demonstrated a passion for applying what shes learning to her community and to the world olivia is an outstanding example of what an arkansas student can accomplish with an education at the university of arkansas
4524813 saying that i am honored to be selected as a truman scholar doesnt begin to describe the experience
4524814 throw in shocked humbled flattered motivated overjoyed anxious blessed and extremely grateful and then you may get a complete picture of what this means to me and to my future career in public service
4524815 the truman scholarship is more than a personal achievement i never would have gotten this far without my amazing family who are my greatest inspiration and biggest supporters this is also a testament to the university honors colleges dedication to student success and to the work of suzanne mccray and all the faculty members who logged in the time to help me prepare
4524816 very talented students from prestigious institutions across the country compete for this award
4524817 it is often impossible to say why students are not chosen but it is easy to see why olivia was she has an appealing spark tied to a will of iron she is absolutely committed to making a difference for groups in our community who are struggling and anyone who has worked with her knows that she will certainly do so
4524818 we believe as part of our mission to educate businesses and the public about world sustainability issues that this film will provide eye opening insights into the coffee industry and a fairer trading system
4524819 sustainability defined more broadly includes social impacts as well as environmental impacts
4524820 we decided to make black gold after it was announced at the end of 2002 that ethiopia was facing another famine twenty years earlier in 1984 people across the world had been motivated to respond to this crisis by giving aid the difference this time was that ethiopia coffee farmers known for producing some of the best quality coffee in the world were also caught up in this new food crisis given that the global coffee industry was booming making record profits for the largest multi nationals we felt this was a story that had to be told
4524821 the goal of the competition is to help students recognize and develop their potential to excel in math and science and encourages them to pursue postsecondary degrees in these fields
4524822 the souths secret weapons disease environment and the civil war
4524823 confederate leaders believed that their regions most dreaded diseases malaria and yellow fever would stop union forces from invading and conquering the south
4524824 professor humphreys will discuss those diseases actual impact on the war and how both sides dealt with them
4524825 inventory accuracy is one of the keys to an efficient and effective supply chain
4524826 yet inventory accuracy which determines important processes such as ordering and replenishment is often poor with inaccuracy rates sometimes as high as 65 percent our results suggest that rfid technology makes a difference the 13 percent improvement found in this study can significantly reduce unnecessary inventory and the value of this reduction for a company like wal mart with all of its suppliers can be measured in millions of dollars
4524827 we are truly pleased to be working with the botanical garden of the ozarks
4524828 we saw our joining as an opportunity fill a need for area teachers
4524829 consolidation has been around a long time but theres not much in the literature about what the experience is like for people who live through it
4524830 the ones that spoke with us had achieved relatively successful consolidation
4524831 ones that experienced greater controversy refused and thats a shame that information could have been very helpful some districts that anticipated consolidation took a more proactive approach while others fought it tooth and nail
4524832 when the teachers in receiving schools saw differences such as larger class sizes they didnt always attribute them directly to the consolidation
4524833 people who moved were more likely to see the differences as directly related to consolidation
4524834 we did not find a significant increase due to consolidation it was usually 10 15 minutes at the most
4524835 the experience for those who moved was much more traumatic than for those who received new students and teachers
4524836 you would think it would be equally traumatic also the students adapted easier than the adults one teacher who moved to a new school said the new students accepted her but the other teachers didnt
4524837 thats why it is particularly important to keep something open in the district thats closing
4524838 part of the value to our users is that the site offers one stop shopping for the legal information they need
4524839 our site has all of the frequently asked questions from both the irs and the secretary of state web sites the secretary of state has even linked to our site so that visitors to their site can easily find ours
4524840 we are able to provide this comprehensive resource for arkansas and the nation because of the team effort of the many people involved
4524841 while the school of law is responsible for developing the sites content there are many people in the school of continuing education and academic outreach who work behind the scenes filming lectures designing the site and marketing it to potential users
4524842 we rely on student research assistants and members of equal justice works a legal student organization to keep the site updated and accurate
4524843 student volunteers organize training sessions and donate their time to perform legal research using the latest technology these students model the ethical mandate that lawyers should use their legal education to give back to the community
4524844 our biggest goal is to find a permanent source of funding for the site
4524845 we also hope to introduce a number of technological features including podcasting closed captioning and a blog and to double the number of video lectures to better serve our users
4524846 to our knowledge this is the first implementation of non traditional diagonal aisles anywhere
4524847 we had a clean slate opportunity for our warehouse in whitewater and i had just learned of their work in modern materials handling magazine
4524848 i contacted our director of operations and he was positive on the idea his team ran some numbers to prove the benefit and three months later we had drawings in our hands
4524849 for most managers in the logistics industry implementing this kind of design is a little scary
4524850 we have racking in the middle section between the diagonal aisles and floor storage below the diagonals that gives us the flexibility to adjust to changing operating conditions in the future
4524851 the implementation at generac is a real boon for us
4524852 now we can point to them and say see this really can be done
4524853 to show the world what his eyes have seen differently than everyone elses
4524854 james buchanan as savior political power political fragmentation and the failed 1831 repeal of section 25
4524855 the primary reason the movement to repeal section 25 failed was because its jacksonian opponents were fractured in their specific views of why judicial power should be curtailed
4524856 some were focused on the constitutionality of the national bank others were focused on protective tariffs this diffusion of focus precluded a unified opposition by the time the jacksonians became more unified the supreme court was staffed by a jacksonian majority committed to limiting judicial power anyway
4524857 the more power is diffused the less likely that at some point in a political transition the emerging coalition will have adequate control of all veto points in electoral institutions while that coalition has inadequate control of the courts
4524858 professor graber uses a particular event to illustrate a broader insight that when political parties are fragmented and political power is diffused the judiciary usually gains power
4524859 that insight is important for todays courts and political structures too i imagine that faculty students and all those generally interested in judicial power would find this lecture interesting and relevant
4524860 professor graber offers a much appreciated political science perspective on an important legal issue
4524861 his interdisciplinary approach to law should be valuable both for our students and faculty
4524862 many students interested in public service find that they need business skills such as accounting and marketing to help the communities where they are working
4524863 we are very excited to be partnering with the walton college on this joint degree combining the practical work involved in these degrees is another way of providing academics for the real world
4524864 this partnership with the clinton school provides an opportunity for our business students to network with and learn from students who are going into the field of public service
4524865 the walton college has many partnerships with universities around the world
4524866 we see this collaboration as a win for all of the students
4524867 estimating the supply and demand for bilingual nurses in northwest arkansas
4524868 programming created to respond to health disparities in arkansas communities
4524869 evaluation of voluntary accreditation programs for local public agencies in missouri
4524870 a new concept to promote a better understanding of alzheimers
4524871 we are delighted to have attracted so many powerful presentations
4524872 as we began talking to potential presenters about this conference it became clear to us that although more research needs to be done in the area of health disparities the practicing community is keenly interested and deeply invested in the topic this same enthusiasm has been evidenced in the donor community whose generosity has enabled us to keep the registration fee at a reasonable rate for practicing health care professionals and students
4524873 the achievement exemplifies our rise in stature over the past several years and i think solidly affirms that our department is one of the very best in the world
4524874 understanding mindshift learning the transition from structured to object oriented development
4524875 how habit limits the predictive power of intention the case of information systems continuance
4524876 this new industry is providing a much needed boost to the states economy
4524877 as the fayetteville shale project grows it is generating jobs for individuals business opportunities and income for new and established businesses in a wide variety of sectors and tax revenues for local and state governments
4524878 the industrys increasing impact comes at a time when the state has seen continued declines in the manufacturing sector
4524879 the rise of a new industry to provide economic activity and employment is important for the state and particularly for the viability of many of the communities located in the fayetteville shale region the jobs already created through 2007 from the fayetteville shale project are helping to offset some of the continuing employment losses we are seeing otherwise
4524880 i attended school on a for need 500 scholarship for three years during my time in a diploma nursing school
4524881 with the help of the air force i earned a bachelor of science degree in nursing at loretto heights college in denver i understand what many students go through i had a great career in the nursing field and i want to lend a hand to others who have the passion for helping those in need
4524882 secondly the university of arkansas is the school thats here we chose to live near my husbands alma mater after he retired we are in arkansas now and i am going to need medical care at some point so i think it is best to keep our support here and to help to develop the program that will graduate my future caretakers
4524883 we are fortunate to attract top students for our nursing program and many rely on scholarship support to stay enrolled this access arkansas scholarship will create funding for one or more of our students who deserve support to complete their studies in nursing i am grateful for this support and for the commitment guy and ellen brown have shown to our program i look forward to watching their gift change lives
4524884 it was the most honest sincere appreciation you could ever ask for
4524885 thats what its all about its the circle of life and you have to give back
4524886 it was gratifying to see the trailer for the movie with its juxtaposition of scenes portraying civil rights and black athletes from the 1930s 40s and 50s
4524887 as with katzs biography of coach mclendon the movie tells the story of sports and civil rights going hand in hand to see this notion brought to life in a film that taps one of our authors is rewarding for the university of arkansas press and for all of those who remember john mclendon and others who accomplished great things during this period their example of persevering in difficult circumstances is as relevant today as it was 60 years ago
4524888 lesions in dna subunits foundational studies of molecular structures and energetics
4524889 arvest banks vision is to be the financial services provider of choice in the trade territories we serve
4524890 to fulfill that vision arvest strongly believes in partnering with our local communities to make those communities better places for the people who live and work there our relationship with the u of a career development center fits squarely in that vision
4524891 many business students see banking as a natural career choice after graduation
4524892 but we will work with arvest bank representatives to also attract students in all majors and to inform them of the opportunities that exist at arvest bank and in the banking field as a whole our hope is that students will open their eyes to career opportunities that are not necessarily obvious for their path of study
4524893 arvest bank continues to grow and working closely with the ua career development center will help us attract the best talent in the area to join the arvest team so we can continue to offer world class customer service
4524894 also our main operations center is in lowell ark so we hope to be able to attract the university of arkansas best and brightest not only in the area of finance but also many other fields such as information technology logistics marketing education and human resources
4524895 i look forward to watching the benefits of this new relationship and the impact on our students and the university community the gift is just the first step the personal connections that develop and the new opportunities for students and for arvest are the key components of this relationship
4524896 in our first year one of the main goals is fan awareness
4524897 we want our fans to know that they have a chance to recycle their trash not just throw it away this year most of the recycled material has been picked up by our clean up crews after the fans leave but with time we expect fans will start noticing and using the green recycling boxes around the stadium and the arena
4524898 we gave them t shirts with a recycling message and let them do some pr for us spreading the word about recycling with the razorbacks in return we saved them some good seats in the student section during the games
4524899 they do the work to raise money for their organization but they enjoy helping the environment at the same time
4524900 the development of index arkansas is a transforming event in the study of our state for so long researchers have labored without a good index to state literature but now we have one and we fully expect to expand it substantially in the years to come
4524901 i am profoundly grateful for what they have accomplished it is rare to find such a level of dedication as shown by these individuals and the university libraries
4524902 index arkansas is a new bridge to our heritage it will help arkansans discover that yes we do have a heritage and it is worth studying i hope researchers will make great use of it
4524903 i am very proud of the admissions team and its work with the students who contributed to our success i see the wonderful work done by our team each day and it is rewarding that the groups efforts are being recognized publicly although many institutions submitted work created by advertising firms on their behalf each of our entries was created by the talented staff in our office that the office received an award in each category it participated in is truly an honor
4524904 promoting a spirit of independence and self reliance how can we encourage our children to take on the world while protecting them from it
4524905 we have several thousand students living on campus who require meals in the dining commons and comfortable residence halls and many critical research activities that require constant attention regardless of conditions outside as a result it is critical that we maintain essential services affecting safety and health
4524906 faculty staff and students should use their own best judgment about their personal safety when considering traveling to and from campus during inclement weather
4524907 as a people intensive organization safety must be our primary concern at all levels staff may use vacation time when weather conditions cause a concern for personal safety and supervisors should do everything they can accommodate employees who wish to arrive late leave early or propose some other productive alternative because of the weather likewise faculty should address similar accommodations for students who encounter travel concerns in accordance with university policy understanding that many of our students commute to the university from considerable distances
4524908 the tours purpose is to engage young people on college campuses across america in a discussion about what it will take to ensure our nations energy security and address the deepening challenge of meeting growing demand for electricity while protecting the environment
4524909 we want to give attendees a chance to be heard they are our future leaders and their opinions may help aep and our industry to chart a better course
4524910 integration of technology into education is a learning requirement not an option
4524911 every citizen of arkansas deserves this type of learning environment without regard to physical location or socio economic class students come to an academic environment with an expectation that technology will be a core component of the experience pre k through adulthood any investment we make is an investment in the future of our state
4524912 i have long respected the researchers teaching faculty and entire higher education community in arkansas
4524913 these professionals and the associated intellectual capital are scattered across the state in technical colleges community colleges research institutions etc
4524914 the tremendous work done by dr bob zimmerman and david merrifield to prepare are on is the most effective and the most broad based support i have seen nationwide in the area of high speed networking and high performance computing
4524915 mike abbiatti is the right person at the right time
4524916 i welcome him and look forward to working closely with him his extensive experience in higher education technology and research will undoubtedly lend itself to the successful development of are on putting the current members of are on on the cutting edge of the latest in technology research and education
4524917 i received my commission in the u s army at the university of arkansas and was thrilled to return to swear my son in as an army officer at the same place i was sworn in
4524918 i am a desert storm veteran and my son recently returned from afghanistan
4524919 i am honored to have the opportunity to repay the kindness that the citizens of arkansas invested in me many years ago as a student
4524920 my family and i are excited about coming home and being able to contribute to the future prosperity in arkansas
4524921 i have been most fortunate to work with a partner like bob smith these past eight years
4524922 the transformation of this university would not have been possible without his hand on the tiller of the flagship he guided the 2010 commission helped revitalize the university of arkansas press dramatically increased external funding for research recruited outstanding deans for our schools and colleges and enabled the university enrollment to grow while improving both our diversity and the overall quality of our student body these are just a few of the accomplishments during his time as provost
4524923 one of chancellor whites goals was to raise the profile contributions and prestige of the university of arkansas
4524924 i feel a strong sense of satisfaction over having been a small part of the effort during this transformational period in the universitys history the academic community here has done much to advance our flagship research university which should be a source of pride for our state and its citizens
4524925 as rewarding as my time as provost has been i am truly looking forward to engaging in teaching research and service full time again
4524926 with the university entering a leadership transition period the timing seemed most opportune for me to get back to my disciplinary roots there are unique opportunities for me in the department of chemistry and biochemistry working with students serving as a mentor for new faculty members and contributing to research and scholarly endeavors im excited about the possibilities that lie ahead
4524927 one of the best possible uses of a television set
4524928 gotten people of all ages to read to read more and to read widely
4524929 many positive relationships were established during our visit with the purpose of expanding commercial opportunities between india and arkansas while promoting peace and stability through trade
4524930 the arwtc really helped me establish the right business connections and as a result we are working on logistics for delivery of goods
4524931 i had several business to business meetings in both new delhi and mumbai and i am hopeful these meetings will be beneficial to my companys growth and expansion in the near future
4524932 if slave labor was an economic gold then the slave trade was its strong right arm northern greed joined to southern credulity was a combination calculated to circumvent any law human or divine
4524933 fills a gaping hole in the scholarly literature about a very important subject transcending the strong inclination of historians to confine themselves to simplistic counting and literal mindedness in their use of documents and databases
4524934 surely a furor would have been aroused by the very suggestion that medical devices should receive an exemption from products liability litigation while new drugs subject to similar regulatory scrutiny from the same agency should remain under the standard tort law regime
4524935 ive served on fda committees reviewing these products and the fda doesnt always get it right
4524936 sometimes the product manufacturer doesnt give fda all the adverse data sometimes the fda has to reverse course and pull a product that its already approved off the market juries ought to be able to hear those cases
4524937 records the sacraments of labor and the dark equivocations of history
4524938 how rare it is to encounter a writer to encounter any human being who finds the world more compelling than the self
4524939 he thinks of the words he writes of the dark like silt beneath them and of the secret hiding like a crayfish there
4524940 he played the barn vents at curing time like the stops of an instrument and went on cupping his hands around the life hed inherited as if it were a flame
4524941 at the depot market they say blue mold high color they are nodding and saying sucker dope they are leaning on the counter and talking about black patch high boys flue cured they are arguing about horn worms and buyouts they are saying come back come back come back
4524942 one of the most urgent and passionate histories of popular music ever written
4524943 our italian colleagues are seeking specific information on park and land management
4524944 we also want to brainstorm on ideas for economic development what im hoping for is that we can move from identifying opportunities and constraints to developing specific ideas for the park
4524945 the park is not organized to accommodate tourists for a week or longer so they come for a day and then return to rome which is a shame
4524946 this obviously generates tensions between the living population which needs business development and accessibility and the environmental and protectionist needs of the park
4524947 our relationship is evolving and this trip which concludes with the public symposium expands the dialogue to include anyone interested in cultural resource protection and sustainable park and land management
4524948 it used to be little more than mortar and cinder blocks with beat up trucks out front
4524949 today many people drive bmws and mercedes and have second homes
4524950 when walking through the village you dont get the feeling that the house layouts are curved
4524951 we didnt want to leave our desert traditions behind because we were living in a city
4524952 everyone in a particular block was related through marriage or through blood
4524953 this appears to be the perfect setting for this a 20 year old city where everyone moves at the same time to the same place with the same resources
4524954 more than a decade ago an industry study indicated that there is as much as 13 billion in waste in the u s health care supply chain and even with the efficiencies we implemented since then weve barely scratched the surface
4524955 supplies make up the second largest expense category for any hospital so maximizing savings opportunities and strategies to enhance efficiency are essential steps to creating a healthier health care system in the u s we want to use individual vha member organizations and our supply chain network as test laboratories for the ideas and innovations that come out of the center
4524956 with the support of our strategic partners the center is poised to create real change in health care logistics
4524957 the support provided by our partners will help us to eliminate wasteful and unreliable practices in the health care supply chains that lead to increased expense and the risk of serious medical errors we strive to create information and logistics systems that will allow providers to put the focus back where it belongs on the patients
4524958 our agreement with vha represents a linkage with more than 1 400 not for profit hospitals and more than 21 000 non acute care providers across the nation we all have a shared goal to help increase efficiency and improve patient care
4524959 ultimately health care needs to link cost and quality together in an understandable way for clinicians many of these types of advances could come out of the center
4524960 at a time when many news organizations are facing serious financial challenges the work of the dow jones newspaper fund in helping foster a steady flow of talented young people into journalism is more important than ever
4524961 the story of how bob woodward and carl bernstein uncovered the corruption behind the watergate scandal has always inspired me it took a lot of hard work and a lot of guts but they never gave up their story changed the way the media looked at the government from then on it taught journalists that just maybe the powers that be arent always being truthful with us
4524962 some people prefer the intimateness of working and living in a small town where you know everyone and everyone knows you but ive always been attracted to the anonymity of the city
4524963 psychically charged nervy both measured and fevered compassionate and outrageous and alive to the very core a review in
4524964 helgott hyetts poems about love infidelity and the body in all its guises are tough tender and juicy
4524965 reflect both her anguish and her fervor their warmth elevates the reader to spiritual heights
4524966 for most of the civil war confederate general robert e lee rode an iron gray horse named what
4524967 they were afraid that the single best idea would be obvious and everyone would write the same paper
4524968 i stuck with the original assignment if everyone agreed on the same single best idea for school reform i thought we should know what that idea is
4524969 this set of practical proposals should provide policymakers and researchers with the kinds of ideas we need to be considering for making significant improvements in k 12 education
4524970 i am excited to begin implementing the work that the presidents climate commitment and other emerging programs call for
4524971 the university of arkansas has the leadership expertise and commitment to achieve important environmental results through our work in academics campus life and facilities management
4524972 we are committed to taking higher education across arkansas and around the world to help individuals and their regions address the economic and cultural imperatives of our 21 st century global community
4524973 global campus is more descriptive of our vision since our scope and reach is not limited to the physical boundaries of the fayetteville campus
4524974 as we continue to rapidly expand our educational programming we want everyone to be aware that a university of arkansas education is within their reach people who have not sought or completed a higher education degree because they are location bound or challenged by family or career responsibilities now have viable educational opportunities
4524975 a growing number of students who couldnt come to the fayetteville campus for any number of reasons are now completing their undergraduate degrees and pursuing advanced degrees through the global campus
4524976 to this end our instructional design specialists are working with university faculty and academic departments to develop even more flexible learning opportunities for the citizens of arkansas and the world
4524977 we are very excited about this particular exhibit everyone likes a good who done it and this experience blends just the right amount of mystery into real science and history
4524978 this exhibit uses the mystery and intrigue of the mayan empire to explore math science and history in a way thats sure to capture the imagination of everyone who visits
4524979 we continue to be struck by rapid and unpredictable change
4524980 some theorists talk it about in terms of postmodernism which is one way of saying that our culture has become fractured consumer culture reflects this situation as consumers adapt to these changes by varying their lifestyle they downshift upgrade change their hair body clothes car house career geographic location and even family the result is a loss of personal anchors needed for identity we found that tattoos provide this anchor their popularity reflects a need for stability predictability permanence and identity
4524981 our analyses revealed that identity is an ongoing negotiation between the individual who chooses to narrate particular scenes and the culture within which the individual lives
4524982 redemption and contamination sequences as common story lines helped us better understand the long term consequences of tattoos and their role in the negotiation process
4524983 selling a product by listing its attributes is an old paradigm
4524984 companies understand that identity and personal narrative are extremely effective tools for marketing products they are valuable explanations for why and what people consume
4524985 major oil companies are already examining biodiesel as an alternative to petroleum
4524986 with the current price of petroleum diesel and the results of this project and others i think energy producers will think even more seriously about combining petroleum based diesel with a biodiesel product made out of crude and inexpensive feedstocks
4524987 the supercritical method hit the free fatty acid problem head on
4524988 because it dissolves the feed material and eliminates the need for the base catalyst we now do not have the problems with soap formation and loss of yield the supercritical method actually prefers free fatty acid feedstocks
4524989 biodiesel provides an effective sustainable use fuel with many desirable properties
4524990 in addition to being a renewable biodegradable and carbon neutral fuel source it can be formed in a matter of months from feedstocks produced locally which promotes a more sustainable energy infrastructure it also decreases dependence on foreign oil and creates new labor and market opportunities for domestic crops
4524991 studying the security of rural transportation networks is important because most of the existing knowledge is based on transportation networks in urban areas
4524992 so one of the goals of our research was to evaluate the scalability and adaptability of existing urban based tools to the security of rural transportation networks
4524993 arkansas is a natural laboratory for studying the security of rural transportation networks
4524994 in addition to the typical transportation assets the state has access to inland waterways major interstates and the mississippi river
4524995 we are excited about the applications of this innovative technology to come to more informed financial decision making
4524996 markets are global but competition is local understanding the idiosyncratic attributes of consumers where they live and work is critical to the success of any business our students have an unparalleled window of opportunity to lead in the strategic use of this innovative technology
4524997 mapinfo is dedicated to fostering education in location intelligence and we are proud to partner with the walton college to help build a world class program
4524998 together with gadberry group we look forward to working with the garrison financial institute and the center for retailing excellence to deliver the students the most innovative industry leading solution and ensuring they graduate with a distinct advantage over their competition in the workplace
4524999 we could not be more excited about this alliance the opportunity to leverage our microbuildt product with mapinfos best of breed mapping technology in an academic setting is a great way to help future retail and real estate professionals understand the power of data and visualization
4525000 geospatial technology combined with market specific detailed data is having an important and broad impact on retail today and will have an expanded one in the future
4525001 this alliance will allow students in the walton college the unique opportunity to be exposed to these tools to assist them in retail financial decision making
4525002 the contributions he will make toward the success of our students will be outstanding
4525003 i am excited humbled and filled with pride as i prepare to contribute to the long tradition of excellence within the division of student affairs at the university of arkansas
4525004 without context the resultant entry is bound to be simplistic
4525005 in addition to important dates of events we included information about actors involved explanation of key events decisions or lack thereof that affected the situation and much much more
4525006 professor gabriel combines sophisticated insights on pedagogy with the design and planning skills of a talented practitioner particularly rare in young faculty
4525007 similar to instruction in the teaching hospital he models for our students dedication commitment to excellence and critical practitioner thinking

4525013 these companies are great additions to the rfid research center as they represent new industries and new perspectives on the use of rfid in their respective fields
4525014 monsanto is supporting the rfid research center as a way of connecting with state of art rfid technology and to share experiences with other companies we are interested in this technology as a way to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and as an opportunity to better serve our customers

4525016 we are continually seeking ways to help businesses find the business value in the use of rfid and other rf technologies so we are very pleased to have monsanto and northrop grumman be a part of our advisory board
4525017 why shouldnt people want to remember the strong feelings associated with past memories good and bad
4525018 because we need to live in the present and base our decisions on what is happening now
4525019 im most intrigued by why it is so important for people to remember their feelings and re experience them
4525020 while 85 percent of people weve studied believe they can relive the original emotions from previous experiences the fact is they dont
4525021 once again the walton college is fortunate to have an extraordinary panel of economists agree to share their forecasts for the coming year
4525022 we believe the opportunity to hear the unique perspectives offered by these accomplished individuals provides tremendous value to business and civic leaders from northwest arkansas the region and the state
4525023 this event is part of the outreach activities of the walton college through the center for business and economic research we especially want to acknowledge the strong support of our sponsors who made this event possible their generosity will also enable more than 60 students to attend this years program last year more than 1 100 business and community representatives attended the lunch

4525025 the fulbright fellowship is a recognition of the tremendous benefits his experience in curriculum development and in research will bring to rwanda
4525026 rwanda and its people are still in the process of working to recover from the devastation of the 1994 genocide
4525027 each of the planned research projects contributes to deepening the knowledge base and analysis of key aspects of the genocide itself as well as the rebuilding and reconciliation process
4525028 to increase the chance that nations will learn at last to live in peace and friendship
4525029 providing technology that helps eliminate the barrier between english and spanish can allow for successful communication that can play a major role in the healthy development of every member of the hispanic family
4525030 the college of education and health professions arkansas charter school resource center is giving parents of hispanic children across the state a way to stay connected to the school their childs progress and the community
4525031 we are grateful to ibm for making this gift to the university of arkansas
4525032 it will help strengthen our colleges outreach efforts across the state by providing a practical and much needed resource for our schools spanish speaking english language learner students and their families
4525033 anything like this will build a bridge between parents and educators will be beneficial to the community we need to create more ideas like this and promote them to the community
4525034 the reality is that the more we can find ways of communicating we will find out that parents and teachers both want to give a good education to their kids we have to team up and not let language be the barrier and programs like this will help
4525035 living the dream in the 21 st century where do you stand
4525036 recording the life and activism of a cuban counterrevolutionary rhetorical strategies in the testimonio of ana rodr guez
4525037 testimonio has often been confused with documentary because so much of the literature of the genre has been centered upon human rights abuses and eyewitness accounts of excessive state violence
4525038 but this often overlooks the way that testimonio is first and foremost literature
4525039 from the beginning of the narrative rodr guez exerts her control over the text by showcasing her control over the agents of the state
4525040 the reader is at once convinced that this young girl has the upper hand despite the guns constraining her movement she exposes the corruption of the regime for those who cannot see its abuses and at the very beginning of the text subtly becomes a visionary who can reveal the soft underbelly of the revolution
4525041 makes the women resisting the prison regime visible when the regime itself clearly wants them to be disappeared and forgotten
4525042 diary of a survivor stands as an important contribution to both prison literature as well as a piece of guerilla pedagogy that provides ample strategies for withstanding state sanctioned violence as well as the surveillance and brutality of the prison regime
4525043 the time has come for someone new to continue the remarkable progress weve made over the past decade inject some new ideas and energy and lead this great university to fulfill its destiny as one of the nations top comprehensive student centered research universities
4525044 im proud and humbled by what weve accomplished over the past decade and it has been a profound honor for me to serve my alma mater as chancellor during this exciting time in our universitys history
4525045 john white has been the visionary leader this university needed as it moved into the 21st century
4525046 any way you measure it dr white has been a highly successful leader with a record including tremendous enrollment growth enormous fundraising success enhancement of academic reputation as well as construction of hundreds of millions of dollars in academic athletic and residential facilities there is no doubt that there is strong momentum throughout the u of a community
4525047 over the holidays i spent considerable time reflecting and talking about the future with mary lib and the rest of my family
4525048 im 68 years old ive given my heart and soul to a very demanding position for more than a decade and ive come to the realization that i need to hand over the reins and spend more time with my family especially my grandchildren
4525049 at the same time im thrilled to be returning to my roots in the classroom and will continue to serve my alma mater as an educator and as a supporter of the next chancellor
4525050 i truly believe this universitys best years are still ahead of her
4525051 this grant from cox communications is about the biggest thing that has happened to us since we first went on the air more than 10 years ago
4525052 we were never going to be a real tv station until we had the ability to stay on the air at all times now viewers can enjoy programming from the university of arkansas at all times and that is a very big deal for the students and for cable viewers in northwest arkansas
4525053 cox communications is so pleased to make this grant to uatv not only to help offer broadcast students the obvious advantages of real world experience that comes through enhanced technology but also to offer northwest arkansas cable viewers another programming option they wont find anywhere else
4525054 its exciting for our company to contribute to the education of students who will one day be leaders in the television industry
4525055 exciting and rewarding careers for our graduates are plentiful in arkansas and the global food industry
4525056 our graduates are hired to design and test new products and processing technologies assure food quality and safety and improve human nutrition and health
4525057 the high regard for our faculty in the food industry and research community assists with recruiting high quality students and placement of graduates in nationally competitive positions the high rank serves to document that our faculty are among the best in the nation
4525058 alan bessette has written a number of books on mushrooms some of which are fairly technical but most are directed toward amateur mycologists and can be considered as field guides that allow readers to identify a particular mushroom the actual number of different field guides he has produced exceeds that of any other author of whom i am aware
4525059 people have always called our main number to request an escort
4525060 this semester the program has been so successful and weve been getting so many requests that its tying up our direct line making it hard for other callers with other needs to get through so we are now providing razorback patrol with its own phone line to improve service for everyone
4525061 chairing a conference at this level is an extraordinary opportunity for me as a representative of the university of arkansas
4525062 a faculty of nationally recognized professionals in the field has been assembled to share their fundraising expertise topics ranging from employing diversity strategies in the fundraising profession to preparing successful annual fund mailings will be covered i look forward to learning from the best and the brightest in the field of fundraising year after year this conference proves to benefit attendees beyond their expectations and helps them to advance in their careers i am grateful to be in a position to provide opportunities like this for my peers and for myself
4525063 the earths atmosphere is a human construction no longer determined by nature itself watersheds reflect our wastes and output weve changed their character a lot its the same with global warming we need to figure out now in design and planning how to deal with these issues
4525064 springsteen steinbeck and the bastard sons of johnny cash connecting music to literature
4525065 what i am suggesting is that we pair pieces of classic literature with contemporary music allowing some of the natural thematic connections to come to the surface and allowing our students to see these connections and the relevance to their own lives
4525066 tunes i discovered directed students toward an avenue where conversation about more serious literary topics could take place
4525067 pop music dismantled roadblocks between students and their peers between students and literary texts and between students and their teacher
4525068 it is the process of reading one text while thinking of others that truly makes literature relevant to students lives
4525069 every time a cell divides it has to replicate all of its genetic information
4525070 the cell has come up with this process that we all take for granted yet it is really a fascinating and poorly understood process
4525071 we know that the process is conserved there are also important differences
4525072 in doing so we can learn what is interacting with what
4525073 we give the cell the chance to tell us the answer to the problem
4525074 its like a puzzle where you only have a few pieces
4525075 theres not a clear cut signal and consequence we will learn new insights into the cellular mechanisms that govern the basic process of chromosome transmission from mother to daughter cell
4525076 kims extensive experience in the corporate world makes her a natural fit for this position
4525077 she understands the importance of fostering mutually beneficial partnerships in our community across the state and around the world i am thrilled to welcome kim to our team
4525078 the university of arkansas has been fortunate over the years to have outstanding support from many organizations
4525079 through those relationships we have accomplished great things and i know there are many more great things to come
4525080 i am grateful for the opportunity to serve as an ambassador for my alma mater
4525081 the university of arkansas prepared me extremely well for a career in the global marketplace and i value the quality education i received by working in this capacity i can directly affect the future of the universitys academic programs by building relationships with corporate and foundation entities and by raising funds to support new and existing efforts i look forward to returning to my home state and representing the university of arkansas
4525082 the high profile campaigns in peru and ecuador where some estimates of losses due to tardiness are as high as 4 percent of gross domestic product are based on moral suasion and not fines or monetary penalties
4525083 our analysis shows that prospects of success for these campaigns are dim the findings suggest that only precisely constructed monetary penalties would likely be effective
4525084 we believe that our analysis provides a first indication of a class of policies that may be effective
4525085 perhaps more importantly the findings suggest that the current generation of policies hold little promise and that resources expended in their implementation will likely have little or no tangible return
4525086 peaks cliffs and valleys the peculiar incentives of teacher pensions
4525087 when coach broyles informed me of his retirement i stepped back looked at our overall athletics program and asked if we were starting from scratch what changes should we make to the program and how can we take it to the next level
4525088 we believe merging the two departments will allow our student athletes men and women to inspire and learn from each other and benefit from what is best about both programs we also believe unification will streamline budgeting and optimize administrative processes
4525089 simply put the total program is stronger than the sum of its parts
4525090 not only does merging the two departments make good business sense but more importantly we believe it is the best model to serve our student athletes in the 21 st century we will bring together the absolute best of both departments into one unit a unit that will be stronger more efficient and better prepared to face the needs and challenges of this new century
4525091 since jeff long has been brought on board and ive had the chance to talk with him weve discussed what we might be able to accomplish by working together
4525092 its clear that we have a tremendous opportunity here one that we should seize this unified structure provides me with a new challenge and i am very excited about being involved in the total athletics program
4525093 as is the mens program the womens program is strong solid and viable
4525094 i personally believe a separate program allowed the womens sports to grow and become an equal partner with the mens programs it is now time to unify the departments i look forward to working with jeff to assist with the creation of a model athletic program that will benefit all student athletes and the entire razorback nation
4525095 its my sense that our fans always have been one razorback nation supporting both departments
4525096 today as we move forward together into the bright future of razorback athletics we do so with the same overarching goal developing young men and women academically athletically and socially so that the university of arkansas continues to be a source of pride for this great state and for razorbacks everywhere
4525097 some of the research and creative activity on our campus is best told through a visual medium
4525098 the ability to show research in motion will give people a different perspective on the whole process
4525099 a stunning debut achievement by a poet whose voice is at once irreverent gutsy smart jaunty indignant myth haunted and provocative in its coverage of appalachia religion and society
4525100 an immense achievement here is wit acid and sweet angry and gentle tonic and forgiving every line shines with the excellence of poetic craft hadaways satire is deceptive in its strength if you think you feel a pinprick better look again it may be a bullet hole
4525101 i call patience a neglected virtue because we dont value it as much as courage or generosity because it involves a withholding of self
4525102 in business for example we dont recognize good management as patient such as when a manager steps back and lets others be part of the creative process
4525103 a hovering attentiveness a silent co willing an expressive encouragement and recognition of his struggle
4525104 in patience i share an orientation to the others future that is attentive to the struggle involved in its accomplishment
4525105 a type of rage in the face of human finitude
4525106 when i tolerate someone i do not share the drama and meaning of his struggle
4525107 though tolerance is an important and necessary part of shared public life patience involves a deeper form of recognition and accommodation of the others presence as an individual struggling to act in the world
4525108 though we may not be able to characterize patience as a heroic virtue the ability to accommodate and forgive the limits of human agency in its struggle for self expression is the bedrock of our public life
4525109 i am extremely excited about the class of 2008s decision
4525110 the common area of the union will be greatly enhanced by the beautiful mosaic piece representing many aspects of our campus that make it truly unique this years graduates will leave a visible mark on our campus by supporting this special project
4525111 voting on the class gift helps build class unity identity and spirit
4525112 the class of 2008 is filled with enthusiastic students who are excited about beginning their legacy by giving back to their institution i would like to extend my appreciation to the staff at the arkansas union and to the class gift council who suggested this years choices both ideas were wonderful and i look forward to more great submissions in the coming years
4525113 we want to take our students beyond the drafting board and learn how to work with engineers contractors and the public as well
4525114 this project gives us a chance to get out there and work
4525115 it also helps us learn how things go together what can and cant be done
4525116 so that kids cant get lost behind it intentionally or otherwise
4525117 were creating a series of outdoor rooms with relatively small built space
4525118 its perfect for our space and creates so many opportunities for different kinds of activities it will be a great addition not only for the school but the neighborhood
4525119 we focused on areas that were underutilized and tried to activate those quiet places
4525120 will act as a beacon to attract positive nighttime use of the playground
4525121 this project will further entrench washington school into the school district and hopefully keep it here
4525122 i certainly hope so i have a future washington school student here
4525123 in spite of the multiple management goals developed in academia to direct training and certification
4525124 the practice of interpretation remains focused on its original goal of connecting visitors to nature and culture
4525125 connecting visitors to the history and culture of native peoples
4525126 to us these places are cared for very much the birds still sing here and this place is alive it is not a place of ruins and so to me we call them homes dwelling areas archeological sites anything
4525127 it is nice they are sharing with the people knowing it is a national monument
4525128 im impressed by the integrity and open minds of the interpreters i met
4525129 they do an incredible job of letting people form their own connections with the history of their parks
4525130 there is an immediate need for an initiative like access arkansas
4525131 many students work part time and even full time jobs while they are in school and still graduate with an inordinate amount of debt in fact many students never graduate because they do not have the financial support to remain in school access arkansas will help individuals who face these challenges our state is near the bottom nationally in the percent of people 25 and older who have earned a bachelors degree and the affordability of college is certainly a factor in this statistic
4525132 the importance of need based financial support extends well beyond our university
4525133 governor beebe recently announced the go opportunities grant program in arkansas which will award money to students with need this statewide commitment truly demonstrates the breadth of this issue through the access arkansas program we will work to extend access to all capable students we are grateful to those who have contributed so far and we hope to see many alumni and friends of the university supporting this critical initiative
4525134 we are very pleased that the professional development institute has been recognized by naspa
4525135 this program is helping hundreds of students be more intentional about their career or graduate school plans giving them the tools they need to be successful in these pursuits
4525136 during randys nearly three year tenure at the university of arkansas he has made an incredibly huge impact in the future growth of the campus not only with regards to residential facilities and other parts of the physical environment but more importantly the programmatic revolutions to which he has guided us
4525137 sandy works well and is comfortable with students parents and staff from all backgrounds and cultures people are drawn to her because of her sincere interest in them as individuals and her warm personable style her personal and professional ethics are beyond reproach
4525138 tina has made positive impacts in her various leadership roles on campus because she understands and employs her unique skills and abilities
4525139 tina consistently models maturity kindness responsibility time management and initiative for her peers whether she is serving in an official role or simply being herself
4525140 shehan has the ability to evaluate situations and determine what needs to be done and develop a plan to reach the end goal he is willing to reach out to others to help find the best solution to various situations and is willing to step out of his comfort zone when needed
4525141 the skills of ua production students stood out as they became experts on the purpose and impact of the pat walker health center through interviews questions tours and conversations with professional staff the students were immersed in health services
4525142 they took their expertise and creativity in film production and put their knowledge of health services into a story to be told which would reflect the high priority that the university of arkansas places on students health and wellbeing
4525143 i am extremely proud of all of these award winners
4525144 i know they are doing excellent work for the students at this university and it is gratifying to see this work recognized by the national association of student personnel administrators
4525145 it was believed that negative susceptibility meant that the system was unstable
4525146 in many practical applications it is really hard to find perfect electrodes
4525147 these characteristics may have useful applications but right now we have more of a fundamental interest in them
4525148 this is a landmark addition to the agricultural community that will be of value to attorneys policymakers students and others for decades to come
4525149 this was a very significant undertaking and is a tremendous accomplishment for the center and its staff
4525150 these digitization projects are important to enhancing the centers role as a national resource for agricultural and food law research and information
4525151 in addition we are helping the u s d a national agricultural library in its mission to provide access to global information for agriculture
4525152 capturing moods that keep the audience and performers thoroughly engaged
4525153 a wonderful addition to the literature available to the double reed player and others
4525154 the school of law is honored to have a reputable and seasoned lawyer such as ms caral teach a course at our institution
4525155 one of our schools initiatives is to prepare our graduates for an increasingly globalized legal practice and ms carals expertise in the international legal field will be extremely beneficial to our students
4525156 ms caral is a highly regarded member of the spanish bar she is well known and respected by her peers for her commercial litigation and arbitration skills
4525157 we are very fortunate that she will be working with our students in helping them to develop the skills needed to represent transnational and international businesses
4525158 the northwest arkansas omnibus survey is like a barometer in that it gives a reading of how the residents think and feel about the quality of life in their communities and in the region as a whole
4525159 in this fast growing area its important for local policymakers business leaders and other service providers to hear residents opinions therefore in the short amount of time it takes to respond to the survey residents can make a potentially large contribution to their community
4525160 our goal is to use infor scm network design to put theory into practice demonstrating how different variables impact efficiency and identifying the key characteristics of an optimized supply chain
4525161 we expect this to be a valuable tool for our work to develop best practices for use in the private sector as well as an opportunity to expose our students to advanced supply chain technologies
4525162 research institutions like the scmrc at the university of arkansas are a vital part of supply chain practices
4525163 infor is committed to supporting them and we gain equal value through the collaborative exchange of ideas with their faculty and students
4525164 clever authentic witty funny tense poignant at the end and very believable
4525165 my participation in these projects has offered lessons not only in the workings of the theater but also about the power of words which after all are a lawyers primary tools
4525166 information technology jobs are inherently stressful regardless of whether employees work in the private or public sector
4525167 our findings reiterate the importance of using various types of interpersonal relationships to mitigate stress inherent in these jobs we believe that interpersonal relationships within the workplace have important implications for employee commitment and ultimately the retention of information technology workers
4525168 it may be that public sector mentors adopt a role more akin to a coach
4525169 or the stronger relationship between psychosocial mentoring and commitment to the organization might be an artifact of the motivations of it workers who choose employment in state government agencies
4525170 for some time we have discussed the need to have a more substantial presence in the middle of the burgeoning corporate community in northwest arkansas
4525171 this new initiative will begin to provide greater access to upper division courses and the encouragement of baccalaureate degree completion as well as access to graduate degrees
4525172 the new global campus location will not require an additional allocation of state funds which makes this a fiscally responsible endeavor as well as a tremendous opportunity to grow and enhance our programs
4525173 as a land grant university academic outreach is central to our mission and this move will enable us to expand access to our degree programs
4525174 we value our partnership with nwacc which is expected to continue and grow with this change of venue
4525175 through this new location our programs will expand in a fantastic new space that will allow synergy with the arkansas world trade center and make a university of arkansas education even more accessible in northwest arkansas
4525176 working professionals often do not have the opportunity to take traditional courses to complete their degrees and subsequently enhance their careers
4525177 our mission includes seeking ways to make educational opportunities available and convenient for non traditional students and with the rapidly increasing population and corporate community in northwest arkansas this growth makes perfect sense through this endeavor well be able to create more innovative learning solutions connecting the university of arkansas and the world
4525178 here on campus there arent many people who do what i do you really need colleagues to bounce ideas off of
4525179 faculty shouldnt have to be image managers its a lot of work to organize and keep track of them
4525180 we are lucky to have chris hilker who has very capably ushered the schools visual resources into the digital era
4525181 designers learn from the work of other designers and chris facilitates this process of learning by seeing
4525182 canola will hybridize with about 40 species and one of those is a particularly bad weed pest
4525183 i learned the value of a multidisciplinary approach to solving a well defined problem
4525184 there were geographers geneticists and ecologists working on the same project
4525185 were asking what is the influence of domesticated fields on native plants
4525186 bill schwab is well respected as a scholar teacher and researcher and knows fulbright college well having served previously as an associate dean
4525187 he will provide important leadership to the college during this interim period as we conduct a national search for dean bobbitts replacement i am deeply grateful to dr schwab for his willingness to accept this interim leadership position
4525188 bill schwab understands well the challenges facing fulbright college and its faculty and he has an abiding interest in the education of our students
4525189 i am confident that he will provide outstanding leadership during this interim period and i look forward to supporting his efforts during the coming months
4525190 i am looking forward to addressing the many challenges facing fulbright college during this interim period
4525191 i believe that working together with chancellor elect gearhart provost mcmath and my colleagues in this outstanding faculty we can make great strides during this transitional period
4525192 these findings totally run counter to what people have been saying for the last half a century
4525193 we have to sit back and re evaluate what we once thought
4525194 if you give a gorilla a choice of eating a sugary fruit or a leaf it will take the fruit every time
4525195 but if you look at a gorillas skull its sharp teeth are adapted to consuming tough leaves they dont eat the leaves unless they have to
4525196 this challenges the fundamental assumptions of why such specializations occur in nature
4525197 it shows that animals can develop an extreme degree of specialization without the specialized object becoming a preferred resource
4525198 opens the door to a world breathing like our own but adding dimensions that deepen our understanding of where we are and what time it is that are immense dreadful and wonderful
4525199 couldnt be more timely this book opens eyes opens worlds
4525200 one of the most fruitfully diverse anthologies i have read in years
4525201 campus day is a wonderful opportunity for students to set foot on a college campus and see that higher education is an obtainable goal after high school
4525202 the main point i would want to register is that the presence of international students on our college campuses is delicate substantial and carries with it political economic social and cultural complications
4525203 there are wonderful opportunities for us to learn from international students even as they learn about our culture society and people theres just a great deal to learn
4525204 there are momentous and significant policy implications to all of this
4525205 are large research focused universities more likely to attract proportionately large numbers of foreign students or is it the case that perhaps two year community colleges can do a better job of accommodating the needs of international students
4525206 once they get here what kind of support system are we prepared to supply typically international students are candidates for advanced degrees but how do we meet the needs of undergraduates who are studying here
4525207 and there are cultural differences that need to be reflected in our policies for example in one country that sends a lot of students to the united states the students work very hard in elementary and secondary schools but theres a tendency for students not to work all that hard in the college years so they come over here and theyre at a disadvantage their liabilities are cultural
4525208 i think that the single most important thing is there are the regular students and then there are the international students and we dont pay as much attention to them
4525209 we might have an office on a college campus but thats it
4525210 what a lot of people dont appreciate is that hosting international students on the campuses of our colleges and universities across this country amounts to a multibillion dollar enterprise and thats more than pocket change so the question is how do we do it and how do we do it well that has a big impact if students decide to stay home or go elsewhere we lose out we lose out on the cultural benefits of having them here and on their tuition monies as well
4525211 i think the stories the students told of both warm hospitality and of being virtually ignored are very poignant
4525212 they say something about our culture and our people both positive and negative
4525213 i think the stories of the clash of cultures when chinese students first began coming to the united states in the 19 th century were especially interesting and important and i think the question of strangers in our midst as some people put it in the aftermath of 9 11 is a very interesting story
4525214 the opportunity to collaborate with teresa on this book was just too good an opportunity to turn down
4525215 we found out we were a pretty good writing team and we felt that there were a lot of stories in here that just needed to be told
4525216 when you merge these two materials the atomic orbitals at the interface become important they start contributing to the electronic properties of the material
4525217 this opens up a remarkable new way of designing materials in the future we should be able to design quantum materials with engineered physical properties this result may open a path to the second revolution in electronics based on oxide nanostructures
4525218 there is no better opportunity for a student to effectively voice their opinion on the tobacco free policy
4525219 the second part of this town hall meeting is all about student government hearing what the students have to say on this policy
4525220 paterson is bringing a student from his college with him so ua students can hear what life is like on tobacco free campus
4525221 we are honored to be able to host this competition which brings together graduate logistics students from 12 major universities across the country and around the world
4525222 not only will they compete for prestige and cash prizes they will have good opportunities to network with fellow students and industry professionals
4525223 the supply chain is a vital element of every countrys economy thats why fedex freight is committed to supporting education programs that facilitate knowledge exchange among logistics professionals
4525224 the fedex freight international graduate logistics case competition is an ideal forum to learn from some of the best and brightest logistics students
4525225 although we now see individuals in popular media with autism and the one in 150 occurrence is considered a gross underestimate by some experts in the field in general theres a lack of knowledge and understanding about autism spectrum disorders
4525226 thats important because this lack of understanding results in people with autism not being able to be employed or to be successful in other ways
4525227 people who have a degree of understanding about autism spectrum disorders also have a responsibility to provide services to help others understand
4525228 we should help people with autism meet their potential as much as possible not just for their sake but for the sake of society
4525229 my first experience in the classroom was with children with autism spectrum disorders
4525230 then i ran a clinic at the university of kansas for children with severe learning disabilities and behavioral disorders the children werent responding to techniques we used and it turned out they were children with high functioning autism
4525231 the number of children with autism has increased more than any other type of disability in recent years
4525232 there are a lot of theories as to why the number has climbed but we are focusing on what educators can do to help
4525233 much of our research findings to this point are descriptive because these reports focus on the baseline year of this study the 2006 07 academic year because its a longitudinal study eventually we will be able to show whether or not the program produces positive student outcomes such as achievement gains
4525234 with a total of 36 reports planned over the five years of this project we have developed a highly sophisticated research design to generate reliable estimates of the effects of the milwaukee parental choice program on student achievement
4525235 the private schools in the choice program educated students for less public money than would have been spent on them in public schools but the sizable savings to wisconsin taxpayers were not universal
4525236 importantly we will be tracking these similar groups of students over time enabling us to produce reliable information about the effects of this important school choice program in future legs reports
4525237 our mission is to bring abundant and accurate information to these policy debates
4525238 based on the research that were doing over the next four years we will be able to say this is whats true about the program
4525239 de todos nosotros uno s lo hizo plata en serio
4525240 weve worked really hard over the past two years to modernize the book and make it resonate with todays students
4525241 im so proud of what this small group of students has been able to achieve
4525242 tienes que desconfiar de alguien que nunca ha pensado en matarse sentenci
4525243 la copia de la llave del auto est adentro del florero azul no olviden darle de comer a pluto se acerc a la orilla del r o que atraviesa la ciudad para brincar

4525246 there is emerging a tremendous pressure for campuses to do something about them people with mental disorders many actions are admirable the founding of student peer support groups the pumping of additional resources into student mental health services the tremendous support offered students with psychiatric disabilities but there is also a growing number of potentially dangerous and poorly conceived efforts to find out who they are requirements that incoming students disclose their mental health treatment history weakening of rules concerning the confidentiality of contacts with counseling centers and health centers the ejection from campus of them if they get into any trouble at all or if their suffering and symptoms are too evident we must resist these pressures
4525247 why did alice say to kitty perhaps looking glass milk isnt good to drink a brief explanation of handedness from weak bosons to the double helix
4525248 beacon of hope the story of the university of arkansas
4525249 uatv is proud to be able to help tell the story of the university by making this film available to a wide audience on these occasions
4525250 broadcasting great stories in documentary form is one of the things we take pride in doing at uatv
4525251 the recession word is on the lips of a lot of economy watchers it is important to see what areas hold the opportunities and challenges for the local economy in this slowed environment
4525252 the quarterly business analysis program exists to help community and business leaders obtain the knowledge that will help them make informed decisions
4525253 many u s companies do business internationally and we want to prepare our students for the global marketplace
4525254 this new executive mba represents one of several ways that the college is expanding its international footprint
4525255 we believe that our executive mba program is unique in that it focuses on the many aspects of the retail industry
4525256 the program will combine both an academic insight and industry experience from executives in residence in the curriculum
4525257 we have worked for several years to develop this executive mba
4525258 we are very grateful for the insight and direction from our advisory board in addition many walton college faculty and staff have worked to create an outstanding curriculum
4525259 in the muslim world religion is very much intertwined with the political and social world
4525260 true salvation comes through honoring the role of the imams to bring about a religious utopia these millenarian groups believed they had to take up arms after a period of concealment the mahdi much like a jewish messianic figure would return to transform the world
4525261 utopian and salvationist motifs figure importantly in any revolutionary movement but it is clear that the resonances of shiite mahdism and social consciousness played a major role in the iranian revolution in a way that sets it apart from such predecessors as the french or russian revolutions
4525262 a rich history drenched in blood rich in disputations and professor tucker is a terrific guide to this upheaval
4525263 this is a very exciting time for us especially li
4525264 years ago he recognized a problem and not only conceived a solution but designed and built a prototype of it since then he has worked extremely hard to commercialize his idea in this way i think he epitomizes the entrepreneurial spirit of america
4525265 we will provide the safest and highest quality baby products in the united states
4525266 i want to address the call to law and will offer a somewhat personal perspective on what that call means for me i will also discuss what i hope law students and legal educators will see it to be as we view careers in law near the end of the first decade of the 21st century
4525267 judge griffen has been a path breaker and an excellent model for young lawyers in pursuing a law career oriented toward public service
4525268 as the workers compensation commissioner as a tall building lawyer as court of appeals judge and as an advocate for free speech rights he has set a standard for aspiring attorneys to emulate
4525269 one reason university day has become such an annual success is that regional k 12 students and teachers have the opportunity to interact with faculty in creative and novel approaches to math and science education
4525270 students and teachers view windows into the future of science math and technology as they participate in a day of hands on laboratory activities using state of the art equipment and technology we offer students the chance to experience the relevance of science and we offer teachers new ideas and techniques to use in their classrooms
4525271 science has reached the point where the key discoveries are possible only by studying extremely complex systems
4525272 these discoveries increase knowledge of course but they also fuel economic development the star of arkansas is essential to the future of both the university and the state of arkansas
4525273 computer simulation and modeling using computers like the star of arkansas make the impossible possible
4525274 these techniques give scientists the opportunity to see and study things that cannot otherwise be seen or studied
4525275 the star of arkansas has the potential to improve arkansas economic future through research in areas such as natural gas production bird flu prevention rice irrigation nanotechnology large scale transportation and commerce systems material design sustainability and personalized medicine
4525276 this technique can tell you things that no other geochemical or petrographical test can tell you
4525277 we were able to demonstrate that we could get a signal for particles that small
4525278 different minerals have different peak temperatures that is why we can learn information about their crystalline structure metamorphic history and mineralogy
4525279 the proposed measurements will help extract the maximum scientific information from stardust particles and complement mineralogical elemental and isotopic measurements and they can be applied to large numbers of grains to map the history of cometary particles
4525280 these studies address nasas objective of understanding small bodies as building blocks of the planets
4525281 don and ellen edmondson have long shared their time energy and resources with the university of arkansas this gift will surely transform the school of architecture providing funds for the school to continue raising the bar on their already nationally recognized programs
4525282 the edmondsons have shown great leadership in many statewide organizations including the winthrop p rockefeller cancer institute at uams we thank them for their foresight in establishing this planned gift which will provide significant funds for cancer research and treatment for many years to come
4525283 this gift from the edmondsons comes from their generous spirits
4525284 don has provided outstanding leadership and service as a member of the foundation board for the past decade we have been so fortunate to have his thoughtful counsel and fundraising support as long time friends and donors to ach this extraordinary couple has decided in one more way to help children those that cannot help themselves future generations of children will benefit from the edmondsons vision and compassionate hearts
4525285 i was so struck by his art and architecture it was the coolest thing ive ever seen
4525286 he inspired me to aspire to do well in life to reach those goals that i wanted to reach and on top of that list was to live in a fay jones home
4525287 to honor fay and gus and what they have meant in our lives and hopefully to inspire other people to support the school and its mission i hope that the gift will inspire people to give not just money but their time and talents as well
4525288 its been very fulfilling for ellen and me in the latter part of our lives to share our resources
4525289 this gift ensures that everything weve worked for will help somebody else
4525290 the edmondsons gift will have a huge impact on generations of faculty and students to come we are very grateful for their generous support of our program
4525291 as the university moves forward valued benefactors like the edmondsons make our goals of growth and continued excellence possible
4525292 this gift opens many new doors for the school of architecture its programs students and faculty we simply cannot say thank you enough
4525293 halls poems are physically charged nervy both measured and fevered compassionate and outrageous and alive to the very core
4525294 helfgott hyetts poems about love infidelity and the body in all its guises are tough tender and juicy
4525295 this years event will be amazing our ultimate goal is provide children as well as adults a safe and fun environment this halloween
4525296 greek life organizations as well as other registered student organizations on campus have a passion about this project
4525297 we hope to raise a lot of money to help the bongimfundo school because it is such a great cause
4525298 we keep careful records on the rate of sale for all of our 600 plus titles projecting each books sale over a 10 year period if we have more books in stock than we can sell in that time we reduce prices to move some inventory
4525299 we had to try to print enough books to insure we wouldnt sell out of a title while still trying not to overprint and have excess inventory
4525300 these days with economical short print runs we can print more conservatively and not run the risk of having more than we can sell with the new technology our goal is to have no overstocks in the future
4525301 this is a great opportunity to do some early christmas shopping
4525302 in canada the response at least in theory can occur in real time with the legislature having the power to override a judicial interpretation of the nations charter
4525303 the united states also has various forms of dialogue although they occur over a more extended period constitutional amendment replacement of judges when retirements occur and probably most interesting the response emphasized by yale law professors robert post and reva siegel that sitting judges views can be influenced and changed by their observation of on going and important social movements
4525304 the power of the courts as a check on the powers of the president and the congress concerns every american guantanamo prisoners environmental rules the use of lethal injection and of course the management of elections are all before the supreme court just this year
4525305 it is a real treat to have one of americas best scholars in fayetteville to discuss this problem from a global perspective
4525306 professor tushnets extensive knowledge of this societal and political issue makes him an ideal scholar presenter in the hartman hotz lecture series
4525307 we are deeply grateful to the walker family for their vision and leadership in this wonderful building
4525308 more students are coming back for graduate business education graduate degrees give our students a competitive edge in the global marketplace and contribute to building a highly educated workforce for arkansas walker hall will help accommodate our anticipated growth in both graduate and undergraduate students
4525309 im delighted that this day has arrived and we are able to dedicate another world class facility constructed on the university of arkansas campus
4525310 when the walker family made the lead gift toward the willard j walker hall graduate business building we knew that their leadership would help construct a much needed academic facility that would aid the institution for years to come the results have exceeded all our expectations again id like to thank the walker family and all the other benefactors who made this tribute to willard walker a reality
4525311 walker hall features the most advanced classroom and business technology the kind used in the nations largest organizations as well as in other top business schools
4525312 our trading center where faculty and students manage almost 12 million in real money is one of a very few like it in the country we are also very grateful to other friends and alumni for helping us create such outstanding educational experiences for our students
4525313 i am pleased to say that we have delivered on the promise of the buildings vision to facilitate the creation of business knowledge and serve as a connecting point among faculty students and the business world
4525314 a lot of people had a voice in the building and these parameters guided the architects and builders in creating its spaces
4525315 with the plaza and walker halls student forum and walter b cole caf weve provided areas for students to gather and network in a relaxed space that supports the exchange of ideas the forum is used for town hall meetings panel discussions career fairs industry forums roundtable discussions and study groups
4525316 to capture it in a nutshell drs murphy and christy mcmullin have done innovative research and understand how to change barriers which prevent communities of color from developing and preserving assets
4525317 they are both doing cutting edge research and understand how race and income intersect with asset policies and programs
4525318 they have an understanding of how to change the system and they have innovative ideas about how to close the racial wealth gap
4525319 our goal was to have one person from one institution but in some cases we made an exception when it seemed like it was important to include two peoples particular expertise
4525320 being selected to attend this gathering is an honor and an opportunity
4525321 its an honor in the sense that its sponsored by the ford foundation and insight center which are two very strong entities committed to this stream of work and its an opportunity because were being included in a conversation with major players in this area
4525322 its a huge honor because theyre very selective in who theyre inviting
4525323 there were a total of only 175 invitees nationwide and just a portion of those are from academia
4525324 we come together to talk about issues surrounding the racial wealth gap various research practice in the field and trends that are sparking
4525325 we also put our heads around what strategies can be put in place to close this gap were talking about strategies across the board including those for research practice and policy
4525326 the conference brings players together who wouldnt normally come together a broad spectrum of people who not only focused on asset building but also asset building as it pertains to closing the racial wealth gap
4525327 the literature shows that a racial gap does indeed exist with regard to asset building and wealth and so as an african american i see that everyday and just feel a personal need to contribute to research in that direction
4525328 this award which includes 5 000 recognizes hard work and dedication in the supply chain management field the purpose is to encourage and reward individuals who are pursuing a doctoral degree
4525329 receiving this award represents the degree to which leading supply chain management academics feel zacs dissertation is going to contribute to supply chain management
4525330 we definitely made an economic impact for our city while also providing a quality learning networking experience for our visitors
4525331 we calculated that the conference provided almost 1 000 room nights for the cosmopolitan and several other local hotels and it turned out that 70 to 80 percent of the people who attended had never visited fayetteville or northwest arkansas before so in addition to the business of the conference it was also a great opportunity to show off our campus our city and this special corner of our great state
4525332 weve found that were in the top third of schools when it comes to sustainability issues possibly higher among the bigger state institutions so we have a lot of information to share but many campuses are also looking at ways to reorganize their facilities management departments refocus on more business oriented approaches and they were very interested in the re engineering process that we went through over the past seven years and the lessons to be learned from that experience
4525333 we will each offer our opinion about how different countries view the united states
4525334 the public should know what the worlds view is now and use that information to decide what type of leader should take the reins in 2008
4525335 as the presidential election nears we feel it is important to take another look at all of the aspects surrounding the united states and the world
4525336 it is appropriate to approach these issues in an interdisciplinary atmosphere rather than in isolation of our respective fields
4525337 i have an enormous interest in biological complexity and in understanding some of the intricate roles that chemical communication plays
4525338 dr stenken has a rigorous program of research in a field important to future advances in fighting major diseases
4525339 she is highly regarded among her peers and has already proven herself to be an enormous asset to our chemistry and biochemistry department
4525340 look at an average sandwich some meat or cheese between slices of bread and slathered with mayonnaise
4525341 when you add dark leafy greens and tomatoes and replace the mayo you can create a quick lunch with a serving or more of vegetables and little excess fat
4525342 condiments give you a chance to be adventurous and to taste other cuisines without leaving home
4525343 chicken can be marinated in tandoori sauce barbeque sauce or spicy brown mustard to take your meal to india texas or germany
4525344 healthy condiments can be used by everyone whether for plain food or gourmet carnivore or vegetarian
4525345 the condiments we choose are only limited by our imagination
4525346 the architects and builders did an outstanding job providing us with a modern state of the art classroom and lab facility that still keeps the feel and flavor of the original building it is a fabulous blending the old and the new
4525347 the team involved in putting this project together did wonderful work
4525348 we essentially have a brand new building inside a structure in which the important historic features and flavor were preserved and enhanced
4525349 i am very excited to have the opportunity to work with our excellent staff and faculty in this capacity i think our new structure is a true indication of the multi disciplinary nature of mbtc
4525350 we are going to be busy gearing up for our new designation as a member of the department of homeland securitys ntscoe and positioning the center for the reauthorization of the safe accountable flexible efficient transportation equity act a legacy for users legislation
4525351 the mack blackwell center is uniquely situated to address key transportation issues particularly those in rural locations
4525352 our past studies have encompassed an array of systems including highways airfields waterways rail trucking and logistics we are fortunate that we can draw on a wealth of expertise here at the university of arkansas and partner with other universities agencies and companies to provide real solutions to infrastructure related needs
4525353 this disease can travel through the blood stream and infect internal organs
4525354 we suspect that different conditions turn on the different genes
4525355 im trying to see which gene is needed under which conditions
4525356 the question now is can it switch from expressing one gene to expressing the other gene in extremely low iron conditions
4525357 even though these are separate genes they still appear to work together
4525358 it is starting to come out that there are other yeast organisms that have multiple genes for these same four proteins
4525359 its important to know how it is different and why it is different from saccharomyces
4525360 we want to find out if this difference is part of why candida albicans can become pathogenic
4525361 in a world that is becoming increasingly integrated and interdependent it is critical that students have an understanding and appreciation of other cultures and countries
4525362 the university of arkansas is helping to broaden this global perspective through a commitment to international education and by facilitating partnerships and understanding in support of international education
4525363 i think international education week is a time to celebrate
4525364 this is a joint initiative of the u s department of state and the u s department of education to recognize the global exchange environment between the united states and other countries its an effort to promote programs that prepare americans for a global environment and attract future leaders from abroad to study learn and exchange experiences in the united states
4525365 through participation in programs such as study abroad foreign language courses student and faculty exchanges and the welcoming of international students to our campus we give our students an opportunity to broaden their perspectives and to develop into truly global citizens
4525366 because international education plays such an important role in the future of our students and because continued support and commitment to international education and the increased global understanding and cooperation that it creates is vital for our country and the rest of the world i offer my full support to the efforts and goals of international education week a the university of arkansas
4525367 while this years arkansas poll shows approval ratings for state politicians remaining stable president bushs approval rating has declined to 30 percent in line with national ratings but noteworthy for a state that cast its electoral votes for bush in 2004
4525368 if the presidential election were held today who would you vote for for president
4525369 weve heard reports for months now that republican voters arent wildly enthusiastic about a particular candidate
4525370 it appears to be the case in arkansas too that for the first time in recent memory the republican base is fractured and uncertain while democrats have a clear favorite
4525371 just because we dont like something doesnt mean we want to outlaw it my sense having tinkered with these questions for a few years now is that while most people may not desire this for their own families many arkansans both liberals and conservatives are still uncomfortable dictating the family arrangements of others
4525372 should be on the leading edge of creating policies to combat global warming
4525373 nearly 90 percent of the respondents thought global warming is a problem and that is really impressive the 44 percent who believe global warming is a long term problem may be really savvy readers
4525374 scientists have a sense that global warming wont be linear and the poll results suggest that people recognize we need to do something now for the longer term
4525375 what do you think is the most important problem or issue facing people in arkansas today
4525376 the economy a broad category which includes jobs wages and economic development is very important 29 percent named it the most important problem facing arkansas
4525377 its always among the top issues mentioned along with education and health care when we offer respondents options to choose from health care often comes up first as it did in the 2006 poll
4525378 over the past 9 years these thousands of interviewees have helped us accumulate information that guides researchers and policymakers to better serve the people of arkansas
4525379 teachers of foreign language dont often have opportunities for professional development specific to our field
4525380 i pick up all these pieces and communicate with the teachers about opportunities to speak the language in authentic situations
4525381 the research literature shows that being literate in a first language makes a person more likely to be literate in a second language we want to promote that
4525382 its a critical need area identified by the state department of education and there are some good scholarships available
4525383 the very potential for copytraps with automatic penalties assessed against the innocent downloader raises first amendment concern
4525384 the first amendment comes into play because downloading is a form of speech downloading is the same as copying and copying is a form of expression
4525385 internet users who are aware of the law or who have fallen victim to a copytrap are much more wary of sites purporting to offer legal downloads
4525386 we havent seen significant decreases in legal downloading but that fact doesnt matter in the eyes of the law first amendment law makes it clear that the possibility of inhibition is sufficient to find a law unconstitutional and that possibility is glaringly evident in the download context
4525387 as we previously acknowledged the violations in this case primarily involved a rogue former assistant coach and one student athlete over a short period of time
4525388 we are disappointed with the penalties imposed by the infractions committee and believe they are disproportionate to the violations
4525389 the university vigorously investigated and self reported the violations and then implemented corrective measures and self imposed penalties including a reduction of scholarships and a period of probation
4525390 theres one thing everybody in america knows about our campus nothing at the university of arkansas is less than first class
4525391 this facility will raise the bar for our softball program im so pleased that the bogles allowed us to honor them and to honor the university with the naming of this facility
4525392 the university of arkansas has come to insure we have competitive facilities for our sports
4525393 i dont know how to convey in words the depth of my appreciation for the bogles allowing us to name this stadium bogle park its with great pride we celebrate the start of construction
4525394 there were those looking at canonical works and saying what happened
4525395 for example one volume of nelly sachs poetry is entitled nobody knows what to do anymore
4525396 many of the overarching themes of kohlhaas resound in sachss play and it is not at all surprising to see which passages of kohlhaas are marked because they resonate with the circumstances under which eli was written individuals cast out verstossen pushed out of society denied justice by a corrupted state
4525397 the audience is presented with a michael kohlhaas for a post war post holocaust era
4525398 there is no clear position of revenge or reconciliation in the play
4525399 the jews have no recourse to earthly justice in this post holocaust landscape and are left hoping only for a sign of divine justice
4525400 while it is said that we have to forget in order to move forward
4525401 what we learn from the world war ii era is that it is always good to ask questions and to be critically aware because the path to absolutism and tyranny is easy to fall into when people are not willing to confront and ask questions forces move into place
4525402 i hope everyone will join with me in celebrating the four decades of effort special collections has made to preserve the history of arkansas and the region
4525403 after they complete all program requirements scholarship recipients will take positions in high need schools where they will be assisted in their initial years of teaching the project will also provide a discussion board to allow graduates to share ideas ask questions and reflect on their experiences
4525404 we hope to empower many more of arkansas youth to achieve careers in these disciplines by providing high quality science and mathematics instruction in arkansas secondary schools
4525405 once these students complete the masters program they can have an impact on schools that might not otherwise have science and math teachers as well trained as these
4525406 these folks are making a two year commitment to work in schools that serve high minority populations or schools with a high percentage of children who qualify for free or reduced lunch
4525407 during last springs fundraiser we raised 145 000 making it the most successful fundraiser as far as money raised this fall wed like to set a record for shortest fundraiser in our history raising our goal in four days or less
4525408 the money raised from this years two fundraisers will make up 22 percent of our 1 2 million dollar budget
4525409 encouraging members to give early allows for more concentration on new members during the on air fundraiser
4525410 a broad base of support makes for a strong public radio station and getting a broad base means always attracting new members
4525411 the quarterly business analysis program exists to help community and business leaders obtain the knowledge that will help them make better decisions
4525412 we arkansans have to make the best investments our scarce resources to build a sustainable economic future
4525413 i will be discussing the conceptual origins for my l e house and the house for josephine baker
4525414 we are excited to bring the director of the kennedy space center to campus
4525415 nasas spirit of exploration and innovation has broadened our minds with each of its new discoveries
4525416 we are grateful to chesapeake for the financial commitment to our graduate students in the department of geosciences
4525417 the highly competitive graduate fellowship provided by chesapeake will have an immediate impact on our ability to attract outstanding graduate students and researchers to enter geosciences fields i know chesapeake energy will find this to be a tremendously worthwhile investment in the future of the nations energy industry
4525418 through the use of the industrys most sophisticated drilling and completion technologies combined with its best geoscientists chesapeake has generated a 93 percent drilling success rate in spite of drilling many of the most technologically challenging wells in the nation
4525419 we plan to continue that success by hiring the best aspiring geologists this partnership with the university of arkansas makes for a perfect match
4525420 they learned at a faster rate than if they had been promoted
4525421 third grade is seen as a pivotal year because if students dont learn the foundations such as reading they have great difficulty learning in future grades
4525422 traditionally the view of educators has been that retaining students stigmatizes them so that they give up but this evidence suggests that students may be more harmed if they are pushed into the next grade for which they are not prepared
4525423 floridas policy has substantially improved the academic proficiency of the lowest performing students in the state
4525424 that the impact of the policy for reading scores grows after two years is consistent with the idea that retained students will continue to gain ground in reading relative to promoted students in later years as academic material becomes more difficult
4525425 the existence of more objective retention policies across the nation now provides researchers with an opportunity to create more meaningful groups with which to compare retained students than were available to researchers previously
4525426 to reopen the empirical discovery of the effect of grade retention
4525427 we expect to provide information at the molecular level that will shed light on mechanisms that lead to abnormal cell proliferation transformation invasion and metastasis
4525428 without the nucleotide binding site this oncogenic protein dbl binds optimally to cdc42
4525429 it is hypothesized that flexibility in an important region of cdc42 facilitates a strong interaction
4525430 being recognized as the best chapter internationally is a tremendous honor for the ladies of pi beta phi
4525431 it demonstrates the commitment and dedication it takes for the women to win the balfour cup and it speaks volumes to the state of our greek community especially for our sororities the ua greek community has increased by 800 student members in the past three years
4525432 as with any organization we set goals at the beginning of the year
4525433 the key to our success was that every member worked to exceed expectations not because of one award but the overall desire to be our best on a day to day basis pi beta phi chapters worldwide set high standards each year so we are very honored to be the recipient of the prestigious balfour cup
4525434 the university of arkansas has transformed itself the visiting team was impressed with and commends the university for the sense of direction and accomplishments as well as the overall morale of faculty staff and students
4525435 to earn reaccreditation is a mark of excellence for any university but beyond that the report is a very gratifying
4525436 the higher learning commission did a very thorough analysis of our programs their comments show they understand what we have accomplished in the past decade and what we are still trying to do their praise is of course very welcome but their recommendations strike me as being right on the mark and will prove to be very valuable to the university
4525437 ua is on a new trajectory one that is rapidly moving it to truly become a world class student centered research university the 2010 commission approach to institutional planning and change could be used as a highly successful model by other institutions of higher education interested in deep and extensive planning and transformative change
4525438 i think the green fed ii program is perfect for students
4525439 this program allows them to recycle their electronic waste at no cost this is timely in light of the fact that electronic waste is now banned from arkansas landfills
4525440 i am delighted to have such talented dedicated students to work with
4525441 these projects will go a great way to moving forward the mission of the brown chair initiatives which is to help all citizens of arkansas live more productive and satisfying lives because of their improved abilities to read and write
4525442 son relatos de ficci n escritos por fans de una pel cula novela programa de televisi n o cualquier otro trabajo literario o dram tico
4525443 fear itself is no reason to give up on your goal
4525444 the challenges for preserving a language appear daunting when viewed from a wide perspective but when we narrow our focus to the individual to the family and to the community we begin to experience the possibility of establishing a model the choctaw nation has taken that first step
4525445 when a language is lost we lose a piece of our cultural heritage and we lose a piece of ourselves
4525446 for the choctaw people when language is lost culture is lost too theres never a perfect translation of lore and history language shapes our thoughts and creates our world view so it is important to peoples identity
4525447 native american languages are more conceptual as opposed to symbolic
4525448 for example when a choctaw speaker talks about going fishing she is talking about sustenance not an activity
4525449 an emerging idea is to identify a group of children and parents committed to learning the language fluently and becoming teachers of choctaw
4525450 there is also discussion about creating bilingual education beginning with a headstart program
4525451 they are teaching the language to the community in multiple venues and contexts they are committed to building a model of language teaching and learning that is effective for choctaw language preservation but that could also be adapted by other tribal nations the vision is there in durant oklahoma
4525452 being a sustainable university means that as we educate new generations of leaders conduct the research that makes our lives better and reach out to the communities of arkansas and beyond we do not compromise future generations
4525453 by combining pedestrian and traffic systems in a space akin to a plaza we permanently slow down the car and create great moments for chance social encounters
4525454 the university of arkansas is taking a leadership role with this low impact development project
4525455 i dont know of any other project that weve funded in our region that comes close to what the university has done in demonstrating low impact developments role in decreasing stormwater runoff this is a great example to other communities
4525456 we tried to create a value that doesnt exist in the standard habitat house each house responds to its neighbor the street and the park
4525457 the porches are a really good amenity for the street as much as for the houses
4525458 they amplify the social capital thats lacking in the typical subdivision
4525459 if youre going to create a small lot development youve got to reciprocate with great neighborhood features that builds value for the house and leverages the investment the homeowners have made
4525460 this pilot project is helping us to be better stewards of the land which we have wanted to do for some time
4525461 we hope that not only local developers but other habitat affiliates will use this as a model for green development
4525462 the idea of a national election has expired and the notion that the president takes office with a mandate from the public is a joke in todays presidential election
4525463 the public is not voting on the same issues thanks to sophisticated campaign technology polls and targeted messages my campaign experience as a white male will be very different than my neighbor an african american mom
4525464 the question of whether political candidates are responsive to citizens preferences is at the very heart of how democracy functions and it is in the context of political campaigns that we can find the answer
4525465 a candidate may be listening from the bottom up but using information from the top down
4525466 the candidate is listening in order to form campaign messages to influence us
4525467 partisans who disagree with their party on a personally important policy issue
4525468 not because of the absence of political preferences but rather because of the complexity of those preferences
4525469 when they have more information about the preference of the voters and when they are able to narrowly target their campaign messages
4525470 bushs margin of victory over kerry in those states was just 200 000 votes
4525471 i guarantee that in 2008 strategic calculations to target messages are growing
4525472 not only are selected voters targeted through direct mail but also through social network sites like facebook and campaigns are not guessing about regional preferences anymore if you are a conflicted voter in florida you will be inundated with information tailored to your concerns they will know what car you drive where you shop where you eat out and your voting record they can easily target you with messages that they want you to think about
4525473 tell me the issues that are important to you and ill tell you what you want to hear
4525474 at the lower level not on the media radar is an extremely segmented campaign both parties have so much information on people in the battleground state of missouri for instance that a volunteer knocking on a door knows how many people have touched that voter and which message to emphasize today thats the underground campaign
4525475 potentially grim prospects for the impact of this campaign tactic on american democracy political inequality superficial politics and a crisis in governance
4525476 targeted with messages that directly corresponded to the issues that predisposed them to support president bush
4525477 different segments of the population were each told that some issue they cared about was a top priority of president bush
4525478 this type of segmentation means that any interpretation of what the election was about will be incomplete because there was in reality a multiplicity of policy agendas presented to the public and a multiplicity of different agendas supported by voters
4525479 when campaigns attempt to reach out to the full electorate a candidate must harmonize and synthesize interests incorporating them into a policy message that resonates with the general interest of the nation the extent to which contemporary microtargeted campaigns give priority to the needs and desires of citizens who are emphasized because of electoral expediency affects the degree to which the electoral process fails to live up to the democratic ideal
4525480 she was the rare academic who contributed both to political science and to the real world of politics diane seamlessly blended her passion for research and teaching with her passion for politics and that passion was infectious
4525481 we are very grateful to the tournament organizers erik wolff of e wolff sales solutions russ heithoff of strategic retail solutions and scott mathews of bayer healthcare
4525482 we are also very excited that our center board member firestone complete auto care has invited sarah fisher to the tournament to support this fundraising event her passion and determination in auto racing is an inspiration to us all
4525483 we want to provide a networking opportunity for our lady razorback partners and our industry supporters
4525484 these women represent some of the brightest students on campus who also happen to have tremendous athletic ability
4525485 the vendor supported scholarships can make the difference between having adequate time to focus on academics rather than working excessive hours in order to sustain themselves and pay for school students dont always recognize that the retail industry encompasses more than just working a cash register and stocking shelves nor do they realize the diversity of degree concentrations that have applications in the business industry the participants of this tournament exemplify the many facets of retailing and demonstrate to students that the career potential is unlimited
4525486 genomics is the study of the coded information about an organism stored in its dna
4525487 the ricecap project is conducting genomics research to develop news tools for conventional plant breeders
4525488 markers are genomic tools but that doesnt mean we are developing genetically engineered rice varieties
4525489 if this richly endowed and sadly altered land could tell its own story bolsterlis family saga comes as close to it as i can imagine
4525490 i wondered as i read during wind and rain what families in the delta would recognize their family in the jones story many i suspect i loved the way the family history is woven into the story of the land
4525491 each year our institute includes new consultants new texts new lab experiments new materials and information so teachers can return to our campus year after year and always learn fresh compelling methods of engaging their students in the materials
4525492 and it is not limited to the summer program we work with a host of teachers throughout the year supporting their efforts it benefits everyone
4525493 advanced placement is essential to our mission of recruiting and retaining the states high ability students
4525494 we know that students coming in with advanced placement credit will thrive in the college classroom they will have more freedom to include second and even third majors they have more flexibility when studying abroad and more time for undergraduate research the university of arkansas is excited about partnering with teachers across the state and region to increase these important opportunities for our young people
4525495 it was a chance to test out a housing type and provide some alternatives to neo traditional housing designs that are primarily nostalgic in conception
4525496 this house is practical for the 21 st century instead of the 19 th
4525497 it was eye opening and touching these folks have been toughing it out in fema trailers for months and refused to leave this place is part of them
4525498 we didnt want to promote ourselves too much but we wanted to connect
4525499 ive never seen anything like it but itll work for me it sure beats the fema trailer
4525500 for us this is a wonderful opportunity to give a family that would never otherwise be able to afford an architect let alone one of blackwells caliber the design services they need to build back better and safer after katrina
4525501 i think the idea of sharing ideas sharing collective responses to environmental tragedies is a good one we think we have a good design that can be deployed in many different regions and contexts
4525502 we are far enough into this project for me say that we have significantly minimized the differences between visually impaired and sighted engineers who do process design
4525503 while we havent eliminated all differences we have reached a point where a blind chemical engineer can conduct himself as any engineer by manipulating process engineering software to achieve improvements or investigate alternatives
4525504 this added dimension of this project will prepare sighted members of a design team to communicate effectively in a technical fashion with less reliance on visual cues
4525505 aucoin provides excellent information on three southerners generally overlooked by history they need to be considered by all historians those interested in the south as well as those looking at the law and the constitution and those concerned with how reform happens in america
4525506 aucoins book contributes to our understanding of how courageous visionary people at the local level interpreted the constitution its a part of popular constitutionalism its part of the diversity of opinions in legal thought which held promise even if it did not develop as we would have liked
4525507 we are providing more options for students to create customized curricula to support their career goals in these areas
4525508 while also giving them the industrial management and entrepreneurial skills they will need to efficiently and effectively use their knowledge as they start their first professional jobs
4525509 having facilities like the high density electronics center is crucial to recruiting students to our campus
4525510 students get hands on experience in operating semiconductor manufacturing grade equipment in that environment
4525511 this grant will help create more opportunities for students and ultimately it will bring more economic development to arkansas
4525512 torch passes to torch the shock of her poetry is the shock of purity of ice water of a corpse rotting in broad daylight
4525513 poet enthralled to history and music taking on the competing narrative of our american past those many versions that when acknowledged get us closest to the truth
4525514 come from an imagination without peer there is nothing predictable about them
4525515 when the mine first came we all thought that our land would be preserved intact that the mine wasnt going to cause us problems
4525516 what we didnt know was that what they called progress was going to mean the destruction of our towns
4525517 even the most loyal university alum will learn something from this film
4525518 i moved to campus when i was two years old 1956 when my dad came here to finish his degree i literally grew up on this campus but there are stories in beacon of hope that i had never heard until i began digging into the archives
4525519 the interesting part for me was seeing the old archival photographs and films about people and events in the universitys history that attracted national attention
4525520 i was amazed to learn that in 1954 cbs television came to the campus to broadcast a story on professor mary celestia parler and her folklore research in the ozark hills it was fascinating to learn the importance of the fine arts building and how it was regarded as a groundbreaking center for its time i grew up in arkansas and ive been on faculty here for 13 years but this was all new to me there are lots of things in this film that will surprise people
4525521 we feature legends and stories about this campus from every decade since the 1870s
4525522 some of these stories fall into the strange but true category like the one about how there were roman numerals for a clock drawn on the south tower of old main for about 50 years even though there was never a clock in the tower until recently
4525523 as a photographer i was constantly reminded that this is a beautiful campus to film
4525524 everywhere i looked there was an interesting scene we shot during all four seasons everything from the peak of autumn to snow falling down on the statue of senator fulbright the more time you spend here the more you realize the university of arkansas is a very visual place to be
4525525 this year we are expecting more than 900 parents and guests to join their students on campus for family weekend
4525526 we have a lot of fun activities planned for the families coming to campus including a brunch on sunday
4525527 he successfully worked toward returning the school to its original mission of training civil rights lawyers
4525528 brantons is a story for everyone who cares about justice and civil rights not just african americans he is a role model for the positive effect a determined person can have on society
4525529 social construction of self for persons with aphasia when language as a cultural tool is impaired
4525530 language talk and communication are critical elements of the ongoing construction of self
4525531 the way you create yourself is that you tell a story
4525532 think of how you present yourself to other people you tell a story its not just a presentation of self its a creation of self
4525533 but if something happens to that communication tool that lets you tell that story
4525534 then how do you do it how do you create yourself what do you do if your tool has failed you and others dont know who you are
4525535 transforming communication strategies learned in individual therapy into a broader social context
4525536 theres you the professional and theres that other person the client you treat the client you have power you are separate and you dont have to take a risk this support group was based on the assumption that there was fundamentally no power difference
4525537 being articulate is a really important tool in our society being able to express things well with a voice is an incredibly important tool
4525538 that idea of voice not in just the literal sense but the idea of having a voice is really about having a self you cant separate the two
4525539 in my discipline people think if you get the right computerized device into someones hands that will solve the problem thats the easy part
4525540 figuring out what they can and cant do is easy figuring out what they will or wont do is hard what matters about a tool is what you do with it
4525541 as he found his voice and was able to share his life story
4525542 for the first time they began to communicate about how they wanted to live their lives in the face of this threat during the course of this transformation his wife appeared to be picking up her life story as well as anger abated and her life story expanded beyond being married to an angry man who had had a stroke
4525543 we are very excited to have all of these officers on board
4525544 in this production we are able to more thoroughly show the rapidly growing state of this great university
4525545 in addition through streaming video technology and dvd we also can bring that message to a larger number of stakeholders at their convenience far more than we have been able to reach via a traditional address
4525546 through the help of two translators the judges are getting a glimpse of the american legal system and i am learning more and more about the russian system
4525547 i am really impressed with how hard these judges are working to adapt to the transition their legal system is currently in because of the expanding russian economy they are constantly having to adjust to new business litigation
4525548 this full day event will give area business professionals a chance to discover the business behind the disney magic
4525549 professional development programs at walt disney resort have been extremely popular now we are able to offer this program in arkansas
4525550 participants will discover disney success stories and learn about management philosophies and behind the scenes operations that have made the walt disney world resort a benchmark for businesses around the world
4525551 this is a rare opportunity to get an inside look at how disney has been so successful the center for management and executive education continuing education and human resources are very excited to be able to offer this program to the business community
4525552 keeping a college education affordable and providing need based scholarships so all qualified students can attend the university of arkansas are two of our priorities
4525553 this year thanks to increased private and public support we were able to keep tuition and fee increases below the national level while continuing to improve the quality of the education our students receive the fact that the university of arkansas continues to be included in publications like americas 100 best college buys shows the progress we are making toward our goals
4525554 convergence is much more than opening an office in the united states or gaining a share of the u s consumer market
4525555 it really has more to do with greater access to u s capital markets foreign companies want to attract more investors and shareholders and the way to do that is to make themselves subject to superior corporate governance and disclosure requirements in effect by cross listing or getting acquired by a u s firm non u s firms are renting u s regulations
4525556 countries differ in terms of shareholder and creditor rights judicial efficiency liquidity of capital markets and the extent of accounting disclosure
4525557 in general countries based on anglo american common law provide stronger investor protection better enforcement of law and stricter disclosure requirements they are also associated with bigger more liquid capital markets consequently firms from civil law companies have more to gain by cross listing despite its associated costs
4525558 this is consistent with increases in costs of compliance with u s regulations after the passage of sarbanes oxley
4525559 previous finance research has already shown that listing rates of foreign firms have decreased since the act was passed and some companies have threatened to de list we find that this decline in cross listing activities might have actually led to an increase in the frequency of cross border takeovers acquisition by a u s bidder brings foreign assets under the roof of an established u s corporation it thus allows foreign entities to reap benefits associated with being subject to strict u s laws and regulations without the substantial costs of compliance with sarbanes oxley provisions that firms cross listing independently are forced to incur
4525560 overall these findings show which firms should list on their own and which should be acquired
4525561 in conventional materials like copper or silicon you could account for everything you could see through charge and spin
4525562 when you merge these two materials the atomic orbitals at the interface become important they start contributing to the electronic properties of the material
4525563 this opens a new way of designing materials we can design quantum materials with engineered physical properties
4525564 if consumers find themselves behind on their mortgages they should start by talking to their mortgage banker or whoever owns the mortgage to see if they can work something out
4525565 the quicker you respond to this crisis the more likely you will keep your property some recent research showed people are waiting three to six months before they seek help and as a result they never recover
4525566 thats something you can negotiate with the mortgage company because theyre not interested in owning that property particularly in a market where the value of homes is going down
4525567 as a result they will do a lot of things to keep you in that house because an abandoned house loses value as it sits there and they dont want that
4525568 its my personal and professional opinion that working out a deal is better than foreclosure
4525569 foreclosure will affect your credit rating for a long period of time
4525570 if you cant work out something with the mortgage holder or youre two months behind go to a consumer credit counseling agency because they have the right people to talk to and they will serve as your intermediary for free
4525571 they know what words to say who to talk to and what telephone numbers to call all the things that most consumers dont know how to do when credit counselors call people listen because they know theyve got someone sitting there who needs help
4525572 just make sure they are accredited and part of the national foundation for credit counseling
4525573 there are some fly by night operations that are fundamentally scams and those organizations will say such things as dont make any payments on your mortgage when it gets so bad well negotiate a 50 percent payoff and that will put homeowners so far behind that theyll really be in trouble
4525574 this partnership with dupont places process dynamics in a position to meet the needs of refineries all around the world as clean fuel requirements are implemented
4525575 this is a wonderful example of how the genesis technology incubator and our engineering faculty are partnering to address the technological challenges that our society faces today
4525576 it will be exciting to see the environmental and economic benefits that isotherming technology will offer to arkansas and to the world
4525577 integrated practice will bring architects engineers contractors fabricators and building owners into collaboration early in a project saving time money and eliminating waste
4525578 this new chair will allow us to educate and equip our students in the latest processes and technologies that are beginning to transform the building industry
4525579 leadership in innovation is what the twenty first century chairs were created to bring to the university of arkansas
4525580 brad workman is uniquely qualified to provide leadership in this area and we are delighted to have him return to his alma mater and join our team
4525581 they have the ability to adapt these tools quickly and push them further than my generation
4525582 i will work to ensure the university of arkansas is a leading institution when it comes to preparing our young professionals for this change in the industry
4525583 with the xna airport nearby i can be anywhere i need to be for bentley all of my family is located in arkansas and of course there are the razorbacks

4525590 in jeff long im confident weve found the right man to carry forth the tradition of excellence that is razorback athletics
4525591 he is someone who will build upon the distinguished legacy of frank broyles and maintain the level of success and pride that arkansans have in the razorbacks
4525592 the razorbacks are the pride of arkansas and jeff long has the experience and ability to carry on that tradition and lead the universitys mens athletics programs to new heights
4525593 his leadership skills fund raising abilities and integrity have earned him respect around the nation and he is a perfect fit for arkansas athletics

4525598 on behalf of the division 1a athletic directors association we congratulate chancellor john white and the university of arkansas on their selection of jeff long as director of athletics
4525599 we also congratulate and commend chancellor white on his extremely well administered search for a new athletics director the search has been comprehensive thorough and certainly in alignment with institutional core values
4525600 jeff long is a proven leader and has developed a reputation has a true professional he understands and is experienced in every aspect of an intercollegiate athletics operation obviously jeff will assume the duties as director of athletics in a most unique situation with the tremendous leadership influence and legacy of frank broyles we wish frank much happiness in his retirement and we offer best wishes and continued success to jeff and the university of arkansas
4525601 we are very pleased to find someone with marions experience and skills to continue the work that michele began with our graduate programs
4525602 michele made enormous contributions to the success of the graduate school she was instrumental in building our new full time mba program that is focused on the retail and consumer products goods industry
4525603 in scope and scale this project really extends far beyond the fayetteville campus
4525604 we see its relevance as a critical piece of infrastructure to implement a statewide strategy of high performance computing that will benefit applications in engineering science government business and agriculture
4525605 media and memory news coverage of the 1957 little rock central high desegregation crisis
4525606 the life of language in the theater of luis vald z
4525607 i am delighted that we have met the goal for honors student enrollment with three years to spare
4525608 our marvelous scholarship program and the incredible academic opportunities available to students at the university of arkansas have made this possible i am deeply grateful to faculty members all over campus and to the honors college staff who worked hard to recruit these students many of them have been on our radar screen for several years and we are glad they are here
4525609 this new housing will be more marketable and better meets the demographics of the state
4525610 the goal is to develop aesthetically pleasing designs that serve as diverse a group as possible
4525611 after much research and study everyone on the governors task force agreed that universal design should be adopted by adfa and implemented as a requirement and that the specific universal design standards should be developed by professionals with expertise in that field
4525612 kory has done a wonderful job of researching and drafting design standards that will vastly improve living conditions for many arkansans
4525613 it really comes from a lack of experience with this type of design standards
4525614 its like cooking a souffl if youre not accustomed to doing that youre going to be skeptical
4525615 basic accessibility standards raise costs less than half of one percent according to hud studies
4525616 changing building practices now will benefit both homeowners and state and federal governments in the long run
4525617 if you can extend someones stay in their home by just one year you save 24 000 or more in nursing home expenses not to mention the quality of life benefits
4525618 at any given time around 1 6 million americans live in nursing homes better housing could help reduce that number and save billions of dollars in medicare spending
4525619 this project gives the university of arkansas the tools to be a model in sustainable planning and design supporting the chancellors commitment to create a sustainable campus
4525620 theres something very attractive about having a parking garage float over a marsh
4525621 urbanism and ecology are not mutually exclusive but can exist side by side and create poetic moments
4525622 college branch is an invaluable asset to the university of arkansas campus in that it functions as a living laboratory for faculty students and administrators alike they can use the features of this urban stream to increase campus sustainability improve urban water quality and incorporate various restoration tools as teaching models for future professionals
4525623 we congratulate cdc on another award winning design effort with their college branch proposals
4525624 these proposals have provided us with a number of valuable ideas to continue our transformation of this area of campus into a sustainable green design showcase our hopes are to transform a number of these ideas from cdc and others into reality as prototypes for our entire local community to view touch feel and experience
4525625 the performance can range from a symphony to the changing of seasons inviting the audience to simultaneously experience event and place
4525626 awarding mike beebe with this years chancellors medal was an easy decision
4525627 he is clearly committed to the advancement of higher education and the betterment of our state he is fully aware of the needs that exist in funding education and he is taking steps toward easing that burden for students he is a founding member of the university of arkansas 2010 commission and played a key role until his election as governor we look forward to recognizing all he has done and will continue to do as governor
4525628 johnelle hunt has been a valued volunteer and dear friend of the university of arkansas for many years
4525629 she and j b have shown endless dedication to this institution and it is wonderful to have the name of the company they created on one of our new facilities every time students walk into that building they will be reminded of the hunts love for the university of arkansas
4525630 if primates canines are too weak to function as weapons then theyre all just for show
4525631 but they are not associated with any sort of estimate of sexual selection generally the canines of males and females were equally strong given that primates have such strong teeth in general the researchers suggested a couple of possible explanations it could be that all primate males have strong teeth because of a significant risk to reproductive success for any male who breaks a canine tooth or it could be that the strong teeth are due to basic inherited design hominids the primate family that produced humans retain body mass sexual dimorphism that is males typically have a greater body mass size than females at the same time the difference in size in canine teeth between males and females is lost this goes back to the earliest hominids
4525632 the same phenomenon that works on the canines we can translate into the body mass and then into behavioral models for the fossil record plavcan is an associate professor of anthropology in the j william fulbright college of arts and sciences at the university of arkansas he and ruff are authors of canine size shape and bending strength in primates and carnivores
4525633 bicycles are a great means of alternative and sustainable transportation especially in a densely populated environment like the university
4525634 regions bank is pleased to be part of the universitys sustainability efforts
4525635 everyone can remember how much they loved their first bike there was a feeling of simplicity freedom and easiness the same feeling we are working to create in banking these seven bicycles represent a good beginning and we expect to be adding to the razorbike fleet as the program grows
4525636 once they sign up they will be given a pass code which will unlock any razorbike on campus for their use
4525637 each bike can be used as transportation on or around campus for short trips and then be made available for the next user our intention is to provide as many bicycles as we can for as many users as possible
4525638 we analyzed not only the whole rocks but the separate minerals
4525639 this research gives scientists a new tool to investigate the question of planetary differentiation

4525650 his appointment as the editor exemplifies the respect his peers have for his research and judgment in addition his recent research in china and experiences with supply chain systems and businesses there will prove beneficial to his editorship of the journal as well as in his classrooms
4525651 we analyzed traffic on the web site during the previous year and conducted an online survey of our current visitors to see what worked well and what could be improved
4525652 we had an overall approval rate of about 80 percent but also found that we needed changes to make the site more aesthetically pleasing and functionally useful
4525653 our next step was to take our research and start removing what we knew didnt work or wasnt being used
4525654 we had more than 300 links on the old site many of them duplicated over and again the high number of choices overwhelmed visitors to our web site and forced them straight to the a to z index or to the search engine we wanted our new design to eliminate redundancy and improve comprehension of the site
4525655 we have also taken great strides to make the web site as accessible as possible to our visitors
4525656 to help us test and meet this goal we are working with the center for educational access at the university not only does a fully accessible site help students of all ability levels but it also provides the university with positive side effects for example our search engine rankings should go up improving our exposure and rankings for the relative searches
4525657 we expect a lot of students will stop by the fountain and call home so their parents can see how theyre doing
4525658 both of the new web cameras show the campus in real time and we expect lots of use from alumni who no longer live in arkansas but who want to see the trees changing color in the fall and the first blanket of snow in the winter
4525659 the current home page is only two years old but online services and assets are expanding so fast that we felt a strong need to improve what we already had
4525660 we will persistently gather feedback from the site so we can make modifications down the road based on what our users want and expect
4525661 this is a noteworthy distinction reserved for only the best 130 public and private institutions in the country
4525662 we have made a long term commitment to improving every aspect of this university that commitment is benefiting our students first and then our state but word of our growing impact continues to spread and gain recognition as our peers at other universities see the results we produce that will be reflected in our national reputation and our national ranking s annual guide gives us an idea of how we compare with other institutions where we are strong and where we need to improve and in that way it is valuable
4525663 we are all competing to be the best and that competition is good for higher education
4525664 may make the dynamics of the presidential nomination process proceed in a different manner
4525665 a pretty strong indication as to which candidate they should back
4525666 a weak diffused signal sent to party activists contributors the media and ultimately the party electorate
4525667 the natural frontrunners in the republican party are so closely associated with the administration that they are deciding not to run
4525668 for example its not to jeb bushs advantage to run this time
4525669 generally it is campaign related and not candidate related factors that are the significant indicators in the presidential nominations of both parties
4525670 what candidates are doing themselves is probably less important than what others are doing on their behalf such as support from media and influential endorsements
4525671 at this point it is worthwhile to spend money to raise money
4525672 it used to be that candidates dropped out when they werent getting primary and caucus votes now they drop out when they arent getting money
4525673 money is necessary but not sufficient to win howard dean and phil graham both had well funded campaigns but they were not able to get support in the primaries and caucuses
4525674 i am very pleased that dr pohl will be leading our operations management program his track record indicates his leadership will ensure that an excellent program will become even stronger in the future
4525675 i believe this program provides a valuable service to managers and professionals who desire current practical knowledge that will assist them in effectively managing people and processes as they advance in their careers
4525676 these cells think they are starved even if nutrients are abundant and so they stop growing
4525677 if under normal conditions sufficient nutrients are available tor becomes active and promotes cell growth and fat storage to understand how tor controls these processes it is important to identify the proteins that are modified by the enzyme and to study their functions
4525678 this suggests that lipin mediates the effect of tor specifically on fat metabolism one of the hypotheses that we will test in the genetically more accessible fruit fly drosophila
4525679 we have evidence that lipin may also play a role in autophagy which literally means self digestion tor blocks such self digestion which is used by starved cells as a survival mechanism we hope that through our studies we can discover how tor inhibits this process
4525680 energy star has a proven history of helping institutions cut both their energy consumption and their energy bills
4525681 we are working to make the university of arkansas a sustainable campus and the tools and resources energy star provides will help us do an even better job and reach our goals sooner
4525682 over the past decade energy star has been a driving force behind the more widespread use of such technological innovations as led traffic lights efficient fluorescent lighting power management systems for office equipment and low standby energy use
4525683 delivers the technical information and tools that organizations and consumers need to choose energy efficient solutions and best management practices
4525684 hauser writes about professional boxing in a way that no one has ever done before
4525685 hauser respects boxing and boxers he gives readers insight into what happens in and out of the ring everything he writes is fair minded and reality based with a human touch
4525686 tom hauser is one of the best writers in boxing its a joy to read his articles
4525687 what is important about all the names is that they do not bring the viewer additional information from outside the picture but draw attention to features of the picture itself
4525688 writing does things on a pot it engages with the viewer as the viewer uses the pot
4525689 the appearance of the writing was always important and the effect of the writing on the user of the pot calculated
4525690 the writing does more than produce a relationship between word and image which is intellectually satisfying
4525691 this is a vessel to be used in the very context of gymnastic performance that it illustrates a vessel whose use involves exactly the turning up and turning back that is performed and encouraged by the text the cleverness of the text and with it the prowess of pyrwias himself is put on display in particular when the aryballos is put into use
4525692 your impact has been felt in numerous areas around campus hunt scholars have served as resident assistants for university housing orientation leaders for new freshmen and student ambassadors for prospective students
4525693 hunt scholars have been selected to study abroad to mexico spain australia south africa among other places hunt scholars have been selected as recipients of numerous additional academic scholarships including alumni scholarships and the mlk scholarships indeed the hunt scholars have made a great impact on the university of arkansas
4525694 being a sustainable university means that as we educate new generations of leaders conduct research that makes our lives better and reach out to the communities of arkansas we do not compromise future generations
4525695 the new applied sustainability center allows us to maintain a commitment to the environment and also to assist others in their goals of becoming more sustainable i am thankful to the wal mart foundation for their generous support of this critical initiative
4525696 this gift from the wal mart foundation will enable us to create an information hub and a network of experts to support the corporate community in their efforts to become more sustainable
4525697 our mission is to make the business case for sustainability
4525698 it is not simply good for the environment it is good for business the center can also help environmentalists working with business and industry to improve the natural environment
4525699 during the first year a strategic plan will be created to position the center as a world leader in infusing sustainability into mainstream business practices
4525700 we hope to expand the center to include additional corporate sponsors in order to expand our capacity
4525701 there are many steps on the road to sustainability but each of us can take the first steps in our own lives and encourage the people around us to join in
4525702 the move toward sustainability means reducing nonrenewable energy and natural resources such as coal oil and gas when people use nonrecyclable materials in their day to day activities those materials become a continuous waste stream finding sustainable products and services that the world finds useful to increasing a standard of living is the only sustainable way to address and reduce the use of nonrenewables
4525703 scholarships do not require or even specifically inquire about service but they repeatedly select students who have made special contributions beyond the classroom
4525704 intelligent students with ambitious goals and work s with them through application processes i am reminded that our work can help reinforce student commitment to contributing to the public good as they continue their education and eventually embrace careers
4525705 we are very excited this year to have moved up six places overall and four places among public institutions in the u s news amp world reports rankings of supply chain management and logistics programs
4525706 it is a great honor and recognition for our faculty who have developed the programs and taught the students and to our students who have performed in the classroom and on the job our academic programs have grown in both quantity and quality over the past few years we are especially pleased that some of the top 10 programs for example michigan state university ohio state university and university of tennessee have some of our past doctoral students as faculty in supply chain management and logistics at their institutions
4525707 this move up is great news for us as the center has played a role in achieving that ranking the research center connects us with transportation and logistics organizations in some of the nations largest corporations its board of directors is comprised of 50 key logistics executives from 25 national and international companies this support enables us to greatly enhance the quality of our undergraduate and graduate programs in transportation and logistics
4525708 our supply chain management research center has also been a big asset in our growth the centers board of directors has helped us build improved educational programs for our students and better prepare them for tomorrows job market these relationships have also created research opportunities for our business faculty that in turn benefit the member companies
4525709 as a nationally competitive student centered research university the university of arkansas office of admissions focus is to be conveniently located in central arkansas to permit greater accessibility by students
4525710 snakes already had low energy demands we didnt know they could go lower
4525711 to me this suggests that there must be a strong selective advantage to growing longer
4525712 when youre cut off from resources you are an organism that still needs to expend energy
4525713 the protein use was higher in the snakes less well adapted to starvation
4525714 having dr stotsky join the faculty is an important part of our effort to build a body of research that can inform national state and local policymakers as they work to improve the education system
4525715 sandra stotsky is an invaluable addition to our department university and the state of arkansas
4525716 she combines extensive practical experience in improving teacher quality with highly rigorous research in the field
4525717 i came to arkansas because holding this chair affords me a fantastic opportunity to study teacher quality
4525718 i will be able to accomplish many things that im interested in with this chair i can do research that can lead to sound policies on teacher preparation and professional development and improve public education for all students teacher quality is a critical piece of the educational system
4525719 a state department of education is not a bystander when it comes to education standards
4525720 it plays a major role in providing the legal framework for the preparation of teachers whatever subjects they will be teaching
4525721 im very attuned to looking across the university to all academic disciplines and their role in the preparation of teachers
4525722 we have a fantastic lineup of lectures this academic year
4525723 we are bringing in the leading scholars in their fields whose work addresses some of the most pressing issues in education reform thats part of our mission as a department to bring the latest knowledge from research to inform policymakers educators and the general public
4525724 i could be in jail as easily as anywhere else im more likely to be in jail statistically speaking
4525725 most of the talk is highly uncritical pretty drawings pretty buildings thats not all that architecture is
4525726 with appx were only scratching the surface look at what we could be doing could be thinking
4525727 can anyone talk about kant in a serious way without addressing his anthropological treatises kant himself states you cant divide the body of work
4525728 as a compilation these articles demonstrate that race as an aesthetic principle is a very fruitful way to pursue scholarship in any number of venues
4525729 for the race issue to become truly innovative we have to get beyond the notion that blackness can only be comprehended as a closed racial experience blackness in fact is a comprehensive aesthetic methodology
4525730 nationwide commercial real estate loans at community banks have exploded from 23 percent of total loans in 1990 to 47 percent in 2005
4525731 it is not surprising therefore that bank supervisors have expressed concern at the growing concentration
4525732 to prepare banks and provide the most useful information our results are skewed toward a reasonable worst case scenario
4525733 masterly no one is better equipped than john kirk to put the little rock crisis in the context of the long civil rights movement in arkansas
4525734 the university of arkansas endowment growth is a direct result of the continuous support shown by our benefactors year after year
4525735 this momentum is especially extraordinary during non campaign years in addition to private gifts positive stock market forces have contributed to the growth of the endowment due to the excellent management of the portfolio by the university of arkansas foundation headed by clay davis
4525736 chancellor white the vice chancellors the deans faculty the directors of development and numerous volunteers are committed to increasing support for our university and we appreciate all of their hard work the university of arkansas foundation and the razorback foundation do an outstanding job managing the universitys assets the knowledge of the foundations staff members is extremely important to our success dr white set a goal of securing a 1 billion endowment by 2010 and we are likely to reach that level
4525737 since the 2005 ranking the walton college has consistently stayed in the top 25 public business schools as well as in the top 42 public and private schools
4525738 the u s news ranking is a verification that the college is continuing on a path toward national recognition
4525739 we attribute this ranking to the increased quality of our faculty students staff and educational and research programs
4525740 we also thank our alumni donors and friends our advisory boards and all of the community and business partners that have helped us accomplish so much
4525741 there is a strong competition among business schools for good faculty and students what the ranking means for our students is that it helps us attract top faculty it also helps us recruit academically talented students and it increases the value of the degree
4525742 we can control the length the height the pore openings and the pore volumes within the nanowire scaffolds
4525743 weve added one more function to the currently in use titanium implant
4525744 this drug release could be applied to the angioplasty catheters surface
4525745 you could just use water to rinse and uv light to sterilize surfaces
4525746 this grant will enable our center to develop wireless sensors and networking technologies that will have a major impact on people and the way they live
4525747 for example we will develop wearable chemical and biological hazard sensors for firefighters police and security personnel in addition we will develop biosensors for human physiological and ambulatory monitoring and the detection of pathogens in clinical food agricultural and environmental samples these are only a few examples of the kind of devices our center will create
4525748 using the history and philosophy of science to solve the challenges in evolution education
4525749 this award provides another piece of evidence to the impact of the campaign for the twenty first century and the universitys matching gift program
4525750 the 1 billion raised by the capital campaign that concluded in 2005 has allowed us to recruit top quality faculty members like bill mccomas who are recognized as national leaders in their fields
4525751 not only does he encourage students to include evolution as part of the biology curriculum he shares strategies for doing so and engages students in discussions of why this particular issue has become so problematic
4525752 mccomas scholarly publications provide science educators who often do not have the depth of knowledge needed to address these misconceptions with the valuable resources to create effective programs
4525753 his writings go past the standard clich s of darwins finches and journeys on the beagle digging deeper into the fascinating history and philosophy of the scientists who shaped our modern views and understandings of evolution
4525754 only by recognizing and discussing the challenges of evolution instruction and by developing and sharing strategies for its solution can we hope to return evolution to its rightful place as the unifying concept of modern biology
4525755 this building was designed in a physical sense to implement the vision and goals of the university
4525756 a building affects the lives of the people who occupy it we wanted the building to create a sense of innovation and collaboration and to encourage creativity and a sense of excitement about learning
4525757 having raised floors and movable walls added somewhat to the initial cost but the flexibility will more than pay for itself by saving on reconfiguration costs in the future
4525758 we designed a number of conference rooms and seating areas around the building as well as the coffee shop in the atrium specifically to encourage the informal collaboration that leads to exciting new research opportunities
4525759 academic convocation sets the tone for student expectations at the collegiate level
4525760 it shows students that faculty staff and administrators are a united team willing and available to help students succeed during their university of arkansas experience we want the students sitting in bud walton arena to see and understand that this is where they will be in four years during commencement we also want students to recognize that they are not just here for graduation but transformation
4525761 we are very pleased to have dr richardson lead the department of accounting he is an outstanding teacher and is well known as a top researcher in the accounting information systems field
4525762 in addition we are deeply appreciative of the contributions made by dr pincus during her tenure she led curriculum changes on both the undergraduate and graduate levels to reflect the changing business environment of accounting and accounting regulations driven by events such as sarbanes oxley
4525763 did for the court game what jackie robinson did for baseball only coach johns efforts as a civil rights pioneer cover seven decades
4525764 while church has emerged as an important factor especially for black youth
4525765 our results showed that for a population of adolescents engaged in mainstream religion the perception of belonging to a community of support may be more important than going to church on sunday
4525766 the perception of connection appears to buffer the negative effects of risk
4525767 what this finding may be suggesting is that the perception of connection to community for adolescents may be equally if not more important than their actually going to church or believing that religion generally or prayer and other behaviors specifically make a difference in their lives
4525768 suicide ideation and attempts among low income african american adolescents
4525769 larry slamons has provided outstanding leadership here at the university of arkansas for 35 years and has built a respected nationally accredited police department
4525770 steve gahagans performance as associate director over the last four years as well as his experience at oklahoma state has demonstrated that he is the person to lead the university police and meet the new security challenges of the 21st century
4525771 we are expecting growth both in the number of students and the size of the campus
4525772 one of the first things ill have to do is assess our current staffing levels and see if we have enough people to meet the needs of the growth weve already experienced
4525773 larry slamons has built a very strong organization here and our first job is to continue building on what hes put in place gahagans continued
4525774 i look forward to working closely with him for the next six months as we start building for the future
4525775 i believe we made every effort to earn the respect of the campus community and of the other law enforcement agencies in the state
4525776 if we accomplished that the university of arkansas has reason to be proud
4525777 i am intrigued by the fact that this job brings me full circle in my library career so there is a level of professional comfort
4525778 thats the new part for me and what attracted me to the project
4525779 her devotion to this state and to the people who are trying to understand arkansas and its geography its history and its literature
4525780 arkansans need to tell our own story no one else will do that for us a comprehensive index such as index arkansas offers the possibility of dramatically increasing the quantity and quality of research done on arkansas
4525781 the tools were intuitive to us and allowed you to build your own content
4525782 and since its a virtual world the laws of physics need not apply
4525783 we started using it as a 3 d sketchbook for ideas we had
4525784 theres a real sense of being there because everyone has an avatar
4525785 second life is very much a meritocracy you dont really know anybody beyond their avatar and what they have created
4525786 this falls enrollment sets a new record for the university and in comparison with previous years represents a significant increase which bodes well for the state of arkansas
4525787 the growth in enrollment is due to the concerted effort the university has made to recruit students to this campus
4525788 the 18 000 number is a threshold that needed to be reached and crossed now as we increase the number of residence halls on campus open new classrooms and prepare to build more we are on course to reach the aggressive enrollment goals that we set for 2010 at the same time enrollment increases we will continue to concentrate on increasing the diversity of our student body the academic qualifications of new students and the universitys six year graduation rate
4525789 were excited to welcome the biggest and best freshman class in all of arkansas
4525790 we work hard to recruit the best students to the university of arkansas it helps that students from arkansas and many other states recognize the national reputation that a degree from the university of arkansas carries we couldnt be happier
4525791 the advantage of this model created by socorro herrera and kevin murry at kansas state university is that the teachers learn from each other in a professional learning community
4525792 they may watch a dvd but then they talk about it and reflect after they work with the students they have class and try the strategy right away and there is a project director to coach and manage people
4525793 the participating schools will have the unique chance to serve in small learning communities of teachers to learn second language acquisition theory and methodology and investigate strategies that will help their english language learners become more successful in content classes
4525794 a majority of the teachers chosen will come from the content areas such as math science and history because the teachers who chiefly serve our english language learners already hold an endorsement
4525795 this project will allow for more of our teachers to receive the training necessary to effectively teach our english language learners which will increase academic opportunities for those students
4525796 that was the first initiative in arkansas but that opportunity is not enough to fill the need
4525797 even if springdale was able to send 80 teachers in k 12 we have well over 1 000 teachers and with the growth of the district more than 140 new teachers are hired every year we can never catch up to the number of highly trained teachers that we need
4525798 we have these courses here and the university really wanted to be involved in esl teaching of teachers in the area
4525799 once teachers have a firm grasp really internalize strategies and methods often the first thing they want to do is share with other teachers
4525800 the arkansas economy has been blessed with a tremendous base of business talent
4525801 we are excited that it is our 10th year to highlight the many outstanding contributions of these business leaders we believe it is vital to the state and its future business leaders to honor and perpetuate these inductees names and accomplishments
4525802 we are very excited about this years inductees they join 38 other arkansas business leaders in a place of prominence each of these distinctive people has made a major contribution to the state of arkansas and has reached out and touched the nation and the world with their expertise and services
4525803 what our work will do is provide information and tools to make sure this impact is minimal thats the department of energys basic goal with the fayetteville shale play and other formations that have been identified or are opening up
4525804 many times this simply means building an access road or locating a well just a few hundred yards from the proposed site
4525805 these shifts can make a significant difference in terms of limiting runoff into streams or threatening wildlife habitat such as a nesting area
4525806 there is a public perception that oil and gas exploration and production operations are always bad for the environment
4525807 while all development carries an environmental cost it is important for the public to know that these companies are very serious about practices that have minimal impact they have demonstrated this by huge investments in modern technologies most particularly the use of horizontal drilling technologies that allow placement of a well in a manner that can extract natural gas from beneath a sensitive area without being near the surface
4525808 probabilistic risk based decision support for oil and gas exploration and production facilities in sensitive ecosystems
4525809 yet in the presence of such programs the disparity between black and white workers expands black workers anxiety increases while white workers anxiety slightly decreases
4525810 instead the presence or absence of one human resource policy a commitment to avoid layoff is a significant determinant of black workers perception of high job insecurity
4525811 in contrast black workers being outsiders and long term targets of various workplace inequalities may come to interpret policies and programs with suspicion and uncertainty
4525812 if employers use human resource friendly policies to reduce anxiety they need to be aware that not all will hear the policy in the same way
4525813 its important not just to put programs in place but to be aware of how people receive them
4525814 the informal word of mouth passing of a message via social activities inevitably produces tremendous obstacles to black workers who are outsiders to the white workers groups
4525815 perceived job insecurity of white and black workers an expanded gap in organizations with layoff prevention commitment
4525816 in addition to withstanding extreme temperatures titanium dioxide based nanowires can be used in concentrated strong chemical acids and bases were excited to offer this patent pending technology to a company that can bring it to market
4525817 this publication is expected to result in increased access to postsecondary education for students who are deaf
4525818 we also anticipate that it will increase resources for professionals serving this population increase use of technology for training activities and student access and increase collaboration among state regional and national groups
4525819 we are thrilled to be included in this very important effort the recent bridge collapse in minnesota shows that there is a need to ensure the safety of existing infrastructure we feel that we will be able to make significant contributions towards this goal
4525820 the mack blackwell center is uniquely situated to address key transportation issues particularly those in rural locations
4525821 our past studies have encompassed an array of systems including highways airfields waterways rail trucking and logistics we are fortunate that we can draw on a wealth of expertise here at the university of arkansas and partner with other universities agencies and companies to provide real solutions to infrastructure related needs
4525822 im not savvy enough to play this game most of the younger generation has no idea the games namesake john madden coached some of our guys play madden better than they play on sundays
4525823 there is a massive amount of data that has been acquired by archaeologists and much of it is now in digital formats unfortunately much of it is in incompatible forms and data from one site or project cannot be easily located and compared to data from another site
4525824 over the next year it will be our job to lay the groundwork for
4525825 we will be designing a foundation for a digital information infrastructure for archaeology while we are taking the long view we intend that this project quickly provides new digital tools that archaeologists can use right away and then continues to build from that foundation
4525826 the university of arkansas is extremely pleased to join many other outstanding institutions in offering quality programs through the osher lifelong learning institute
4525827 this exciting new endeavor reflects the universitys commitment to a mission of teaching research and service to the people of arkansas and beyond we are grateful for the osher foundations generosity and look forward to establishing a program that meets the needs of this important segment of our population
4525828 we have had an outstanding response in the community to the concept of this institute
4525829 organizations that work with people over 50 have been very excited about the potential and resources like the walton arts center and fayetteville public library have been very supportive
4525830 intellectual curiosity and the thirst for knowledge dont diminish with age the universitys decision to expand its offerings through the creation of a life long learning institute recognizes that fact
4525831 the osher lifelong learning institute is offering a diverse schedule of classes in easily accessible locations that will give the older residents of northwest arkansas an opportunity to learn about many new subjects that they may not have had the time to focus on when they were younger
4525832 this is just another indication of the momentum for academic excellence that is building in the mechanical engineering department and in the ua college of engineering
4525833 successful completion of the proposed research will pave the way towards the realization of nanoparticle based site specific drug delivery systems
4525834 these two young researchers are at the cutting edge of human knowledge in their respective fields with the support of the national science foundation and the university of arkansas they now have an opportunity to push scientific boundaries in ways that could yield breathtaking results for our society
4525835 i am also pleased to welcome two new faculty members and i am sure they will help us to maintain our high pass rate which when all locations and classes are considered is approximately 80 percent overall
4525836 the university of arkansas is also appreciative of wal mart for giving us the instructional services of colby irving
4525837 we put a preference for certification in our job descriptions when recruiting
4525838 when i was taking the test i remember feeling that i couldnt imagine taking it without having done the preparation course unless you had majored in human resources in your undergraduate work and it was fairly recent it would be very tough to pass the test without taking the course
4525839 were trying to move diagnostic testing out of the laboratory and directly to the patient
4525840 although there has been some success at this effort over the past decade traditional materials are not suitable for manufacturing low cost large area sensor devices the advantages of organic semiconductors will allow manufacturers to produce devices that are light flexible and easily integrated into biomedical applications such as smart vests and fabrics
4525841 there is a massive amount of data that has been acquired by archaeologists and much of it is now in digital formats unfortunately much of it is in incompatible forms and data from one site or project cannot be easily located and compared to data from another site
4525842 over the next year it will be our job to lay the groundwork for
4525843 we will be designing a foundation for a digital information infrastructure for archaeology while we are taking the long view we intend that this project quickly provides new digital tools that archaeologists can use right away and then continues to build from that foundation
4525844 each year i am amazed at the quality of applicants for the honors college fellowships
4525845 because these fellowships have attracted national attention and a stunning number of competitive applications high grades and scores are not enough in themselves to single students out
4525846 i am also excited about what the fellows and our many stellar new freshmen will find when they hit campus in just a few short weeks
4525847 we have unrivaled research and study abroad opportunities awaiting them we have a set of new colloquia available an initiative funded by the honors college and spearheaded by its dean bob mcmath and supported by all deans across campus real service learning opportunities are an option and of course we have internships and co ops open to all students great students great programs it promises to be an excellent mix
4525848 the honors college staff and faculty are working hard to create a rich learning environment and since we know that a good part of the students education will come from what they learn from each other it is great to see how many different interests perspectives and passions they bring to the community if we do our part these students will make lasting contributions in our communities
4525849 facilities management is assessing and developing plans and goals to support progress in all areas to reduce energy consumption and our impact on the environment
4525850 this project is an example of the divisions research and extension efforts to support the emerging biofuels industry in the state and region
4525851 it is documented that biodiesel burns cleaner than petroleum diesel and provides essentially the same level of fuel efficiency in a b20 blend
4525852 we believe this study will make a significant contribution to the body of data on oxides of nitrogen and other emissions as well as the understanding of how biodiesel impacts engine wear and fuel efficiency
4525853 i know from running b20 in 30 year old engines and brand new engines that it is good fuel and burns cleaner this project will help document those facts
4525854 if you had a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide you should have abundant carbonates
4525855 so far no one has seen even a grain of carbonate
4525856 thermodynamics can give you the conditions but not the process
4525857 it is clear that gaming is affecting a substantial percentage of the student population
4525858 the university needs to respond to changes in the way students learn information
4525859 the idea of the conference is to stimulate interest and get the community interested in what we should do next
4525860 in the master of information systems degree program we use simulations of business activities as a learning tool
4525861 we are looking forward to the many contributions mr kenner will make to further the educational mission of the multicultural center and to help advance our institutional commitment to diversity
4525862 its going to the polar regions and theyre going to expose a layer of ice so because theres a lot of wind blowing in the polar regions its important to know how thats going to affect the ice when they expose it
4525863 effect of wind on the stability of water ice under martian conditions
4525864 my research also contributes to understanding about possible life on mars because you have to have water for life
4525865 and so this more stable water makes it more likely that life could form or biological molecules could form so its part of the big picture life on mars or way way later down the road if we send humans there for further exploration
4525866 were among the first ones to actually do experiments that show what not just ice but also what liquid water does when it interacts with wind and soil
4525867 i think there are only a few groups that have hands on labs and those include groups at caltech some in europe and here at the university of arkansas
4525868 and i think were pretty much leading the way if were not the leader were certainly one of the leaders
4525869 we are excited that the centers funding has been renewed by the national science foundation and we look forward to continuing to lead the largest nsf sponsored industry university research center to an even higher level of support for our member organizations
4525870 celdi is uniquely positioned to be the one stop source for logistics and distribution problem solving that looks at system design by considering operational impact
4525871 we want to help nurses grow in the depth and breadth of their practice
4525872 we dont offer the clinical updates because they can get those elsewhere we believe nurses need leadership skills as much as principals and other administrators nurses are often the only health care provider in their school building
4525873 school nurses frequently get involved in trying to help a family
4525874 they are also often the link between a family and whatever community resources are available some nurses intervene in what could be serious health situations the types of projects really depend on the needs of schools
4525875 what can we do to be better leaders more professional nurses if we dont take care of ourselves we cant take care of others
4525876 i am pleased to recognize another year of outstanding support from our generous benefactors and am personally grateful to each and every individual corporation and foundation for their gifts
4525877 each year as we reach and exceed our goals we come closer to reaching the universitys overall goals set for 2010 including a 1 billion endowment for our campus another goal for 2010 is to secure 100 million in private gift support annually and we have reached that goal three times during the last five years to have achieved such a high level of support during a non campaign year is especially rewarding i am confident that with the ongoing commitment of our donors our staff and our faculty we will continue on this path of excellence
4525878 each gift from alumni corporations foundations and friends makes a difference in every aspect of our university i believe that we are effectively communicating our needs to benefactors who are in turn supporting the areas most important to them i am also most grateful to our deans and faculty who are true partners in securing philanthropy for the campus as well as to the razorback foundation
4525879 were thrilled to have exceeded our goals for this fiscal year and will strive to continue to raise important private resources to benefit our students and faculty
4525880 gary ritter has proven himself to be a thoughtful and thorough researcher whose work has informed many crucial decisions as the state of arkansas improves its education system
4525881 his dedication to education reform now will help the nations students learn better we are happy to share gary and his work in this manner
4525882 this is an extension of a movement toward focusing more on genuine evidence in the field of education in the same way that is common in the field of medicine and in the hard sciences
4525883 in general an aggregation of many studies can allow decision makers to draw informed conclusions
4525884 in education we dont always do a good job of organizing what we know about the effectiveness of our strategies and our methods
4525885 russ whitehurst the director of the institute of education sciences explained it like this we want to encourage the kind of research that will be useful in the field the kind of research that superintendents and principals and teachers will care about
4525886 superintendents are not interested in philosophy they want to know what curricula and strategies will help eighth graders learn math better
4525887 this work will also be useful to us at the office for education policy because we seek knowledge we can share with arkansas policymakers
4525888 if its rain if its snow we can still have a race lightning is too dangerous

4525926 especially in the winter when i go down in the basement to get the jars its a nice feeling
4525927 so many things are unknown with the way food is produced that it feels really good to keep control of it
4525928 it fits with what weve seen historically from the 1970s and even before then when people tighten their belts they focus a little bit less on convenience items and convenience foods and focus a little bit more on staying home and making their own whether youre talking about food or fun
4525929 the straw that broke the camels back was the economy

4525948 the lumads and even the christians who reside in the ancestral domain would be deprived of their freedom of choice

4525952 its good news that the oil price is still going down
4525953 we will see if they can sustain this because it means they are still bullish despite this negative economic data she said

4525957 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog

4526002 all recording producing engineering and mastering will be done by the band at our own studio
4526003 we had a more hands on approach with the recording process of the last album redimus and after that felt it was the way to go for us we all have a lot of years experience behind us and know exactly how the band should sound and be able to create that on a release the new material is very much guitar driven lots of heavy and fast riffs tuned to c giving a relentless feeling to the tracks which we have tempered with a big orchestral sound the choirs and orchestras have always been a big part of the sound with hecate and that is very true with this material in some parts it recaptures some of the moods from the very early releases because of the fact we are recording ourselves we arnt pressured too much by time constraints and can spend more time on getting the right sound and mix as we feel in the past we have had to sacrifice certain things to reach a recording deadline due to this we will be taking longer than we have in the past but feel it will be worth it and also feel due to the strength of this material it deserves the time spent on it
4526004 well we have for the first time ever written more songs than we need for an album everything isnt 100 finished but everything is moving along great no release date yet

4526006 i wont regret to die on this soil since the reason why i died would be for the sake of all the tibetans
4526007 ive never touched a camera before and have no experience handling a camera
4526008 the main difficulties we faced in making this film were asking people to show their faces on camera not being able to guarantee their safety and to gain their consent
4526009 lots of tourists come to lhasa and the chinese government sweet talks them showing them what they want to show
4526010 many said that if i succeeded in offering it to his holiness
4526011 then they wont regret even if they had to die i also asked clearly about filming or not filming their faces
4526012 if the interview was to be seen by the dalai lama then i wouldnt care even if i were killed it would make me very happy if i could leave the dalai lama this message in the name of all other tibetans

4526018 i immediately began looking at retail spaces in the city to get an idea of what was possible
4526019 i played a ton of arcade games as a kid thanks to generous parents and arcade games conveniently located any place we went
4526020 i was hooked from the very start and also have fond memories of legend of kage followed by black tiger a bit later on
4526021 arcade gaming died out in the u s for many reasons but i dont think any of them are the reasons most people think about
4526022 the number one reason it died here is because of our coinage system the japanese coin system is coincidentally perfectly made for arcade gaming with 50 yen and 100 yen denominations 50 cents 1 dollar
4526023 ultimately i dont think its a matter of japanese people being any more into gaming than americans
4526024 arcades have been successfully marketed in japan and adapted through an era of change the u s operators just gave up
4526025 japan is a culture built around easy transportation in metro areas and there is always an arcade close by if youre in the city
4526026 it was dirty didnt always smell great and generally looked like it was about to fall apart however this was the kind of place you could go and make life long friends and the arcade machines were always in perfect shape the regulars diligently attended almost every day myself included when i lived there in 2005
4526027 i want to bring back that feature which is long lost in most of the arcades still standing in the u s today
4526028 the feeling that the other people in the room actually play video games and enjoy them as much as you do
4526029 local businesses in austin have been extremely supportive and helped to make sure everyone knows about us

4526057 lucky for wanda that clone her canine alter ego is played in this production by a female homo sapiens otherwise wed have to report the dogs mad mistress to the spca
4526058 the dialogue in wanda and her dog is sometimes splendid and crisp sometimes overambitious one soon tires of the world through quantum mechanics theorizing and of profoundly pretentious lines like fate and fortune get fulfilled or im fucked forever wailed by wanda in a mawkish morbid moment clone has few such insipid speeches and so must convey his feelings solely through wags whimpers and body language and though theres not much of a market for human pups these days even off off broadway karin grace trachtenberg may have found her calling this woman is one good dog and thats meant to be a compliment god knows rolling around on the floor begging for tummy scratches and eating out of a plastic bowl is bound to be a humbling thespian experience even without the physical abuse

4526083 these guys had built an outstanding one code scalable supercomputing platform but they did not have a ceo

4526094 this is not you might think a development the beleaguered music industry can be watching with enthusiasm but youd be wrong
4526095 if you look at projected rates of acidity for the year 2100 we are finding a 25 per cent reduction in fertilization
4526096 we were completely surprised because people had been looking at the effect of acidification on calcified structures of marine animals but there was no evidence to suggest it was affecting non calcified structures like a sperm or an egg
4526097 it is widely believed that seawater is chemically well buffered but these results show that the acidification process already well under way may threaten the viability of many marine species
4526098 the paper has looked at the projected rates within the next 80 years but we have actually looked at higher acidification values and we have had mortality of the animals
4526099 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4526100 if our bees were to come in touch with the genetically modified maize and the honey was contaminated with it we would not be allowed to sell it
4526101 it is well known that bees live 90 percent of their lives in a perimeter of three kilometres
4526102 but bees can fly up to 10 kilometres without any problem now we are really happy that the city of munich has granted our bees asylum
4526103 until the end of the summer by mid august the maize bloom period is over and the bees can go back home
4526104 but in some regions as in brandenburg around berlin it is almost impossible to flee from gmcs genetically modified crops
4526105 the gmcs are everywhere and bees come in touch with them one place or another
4526106 after some good weeks in spring bees are threatened by famine because later in the year there are almost no more blooming flowers
4526107 you can see that in vast regions especially in the eastern part of the country there is nothing for bees to feed on
4526108 we found abundant traces of clothianidin in the bees bodies
4526109 today it is easier for bees to live in the cities because the recreational green areas and courtyards have exuberant varied vegetation which blossoms over several months from early in the spring to the end of the summer
4526110 in the cities bees have only a couple of hundred metres to fly from a public garden to a balcony to a courtyard to find luscious flowers and mostly free of insecticides
4526111 we are so excited to finally get spore into the hands of fans and players

4526119 the four congressional leadership offices now all employ full time staffers who serve as liaisons to the political blogging world and help their partys lawmakers stay in touch with the ever growing online activist community campaign and congressional offices have been testing the waters of this new medium for a few years now but lawmakers and their staff are still learning the lessons of how bloggers and the traditional press differ
4526120 many have already learned the hard lessons of how bloggers
4526121 i never thought of myself as a curvy girl but after trying on
4526122 we have concluded that this proposed sale is not in the public interest and will likely create a significant effect on the availability or accessibility of healthcare services to the affected community
4526123 anaheim memorial medical center is an important healthcare facility and we hope this latest setback does not jeopardize its future
4526124 reflects fair market value and is consistent with the public interest
4526125 i think its a disappointment to those of us here who wanted to see an ownership be established and move forward with necessary capital improvements

4526130 it is practically and financially untenable to hold the 2014 winter olympic games less than 20 miles from a zone of conflict particularly when the prospective host country has played a significant role in the escalation of that conflict
4526131 it is premature to make judgments about how events happening today might sit with an event taking place six years from now
4526132 russia must realize that its actions in georgia will not be ignored by the international community
4526133 after what happened its unlikely ossetians and abkhazians will ever be able to live together with georgia in one state
4526134 this is not a done deal we need to do our utmost to deter such behaviour in the future
4526135 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now

4526138 we are travelling to south africa with president robert mugabe today as the negotiations continue
4526139 the talks never collapsed and all parties are committed to the dialogue i would also want to confirm commitment to see the talks end successfully sooner rather than later
4526140 you have tsvangirais backers who are playing hardball and insisting on the virtual disappearance of robert mugabe and youve got robert mugabes backers insisting he remains maintains some kind of executive powers
4526141 we cannot continue wandering around without direction hence the need to swear in parliamentarians and open the house so that the elected members can continue to fulfil their constitutional mandate
4526142 our study reveals potentially clinically relevant differences in the gene expression of different cancer types and represents a reference framework for interpretation of smaller scale functional studies
4526143 this segregation of tumors into three groups with distinct expression patterns is surprising clearly the developmental trajectory provides a meaningful background for capturing large scale differences in gene expression across diverse conditions
4526144 shifting our focus from single sets of genes or processes to the biology of aggregates on the order of the entire transcriptome is likely to be useful in establishing highly robust molecular correlations between seemingly unrelated disease phenotypes
4526145 yeast express a protein called hsp104 which is able to reverse protein aggregation
4526146 however for reasons that are unclear hsp104 is not found in mammals we wondered if introducing hsp104 into mammals could help with diseases connected with protein aggregation
4526147 one thing wed like to do next is to treat an animal model which already has considerable quantities of alpha synuclein aggregates to see if hsp104 can actually reverse the process in the rat brain

4526155 this good man is going to washington and hes going to do a great job this really is the most important election in my lifetime and brett guthrie is a big key to making sure we have a voice for conservative values representing us in congress
4526156 if we dont elect people like brett guthrie the liberals in washington will get their way and will never allow a vote on america producing more of its own oil
4526157 thats in the future i am on a path to help move kentucky forward if that avenue takes me to a different job then where i am right now well it may but today im not looking beyond what im doing right now
4526158 we have some schools that didnt make ayp that had a wonderful year

4526160 a great deal of work yet to be done but also indicate theres very good work being done to improve scores
4526161 theyve been using texting to get out the vote which is incredibly smart because it gives people a way to take immediate political action

4526164 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4526165 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4526166 strong economic fundamentals such as continuing high employment levels rising incomes and low mortgage rates will provide a solid foundation for healthy housing markets this year
4526167 increased competition from the existing home market coupled with the elimination of the pent up demand that built up during the 1990s will exert downward pressure on housing starts which will decline to 194 000 units in 2009 from 215 000 in 2008
4526168 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4526169 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4526170 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4526171 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4526172 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4526173 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4526174 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4526175 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4526176 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4526177 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4526178 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4526179 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4526180 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4526181 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4526182 at once politically concerned and very funny these brilliantly structured ramblings connect the observations of his surroundings with the horror of world events in consistently surprising ways
4526183 benefici rios do rendimento m nimo s o cinco vezes mais
4526184 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4526185 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4526186 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4526187 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4526188 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4526189 these google cars ride up and down our streets sometimes 12 or 5 times back and forth theyre making pot holes causing wrecks and costing our city millions of dollars

4526192 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4526193 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4526194 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4526195 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4526196 there has been a decision there is a first collective agreement for gatineau for the garage
4526197 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4526198 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4526199 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4526200 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4526201 were pleased to have matt work with our seo team
4526202 matts deep understanding of social media combined with design skills helps sitening provide comprehensive website optimization programs for our clients
4526203 an increased ability to maintain connection with the cellular network with more stations available to your phone and less interference from signal reflections this means fewer dropped calls greater coverage areas and faster web browsing and file transfers
4526204 second the links point to legitimate blogs that have been compromised these blogs not only have link spam inserted into their pages but entire pages that are created within their wordpress themes directory as landing pages to host the spam targeted content
4526205 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4526206 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4526207 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4526208 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4526209 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4526210 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4526211 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4526212 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

4526215 we would like to warn other parents who enjoy visiting the riverside of the unpredictable dangers of any water to prevent anyone else having to go through what we are going through now

4526217 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4526218 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4526219 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4526220 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4526221 this was a horrendous attack during which a young girl was subjected to the most horrific ordeal
4526222 over the past few weeks weve mca discovered issues regarding the boats fitness for purpose so its been locked off
4526223 a 20 to 30 minute delay would make one hell of a difference
4526224 while i commend my guys for their enthusiasm in having a go at it its not the way we maintain equipment
4526225 we are an emergency service and we do things to the highest professional standards
4526226 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4526227 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4526228 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4526229 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4526230 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4526231 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4526232 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4526233 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4526234 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4526235 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4526236 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4526237 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

4526245 without a lively visible cultural programme that reflects the spirit of the host country the olympic games would be incomplete
4526246 our purpose is to entertain our guests and visitors from all over the world
4526247 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4526248 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4526249 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4526250 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4526251 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4526252 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

4526255 i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of wal mart and to the republic for which it stands one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all
4526256 while some of them live paycheck to paycheck our customers represent broad income segments and they are all challenged today when energy and oil prices go up on top of inflation and health care and core food items there is a great deal of pressure on the customer
4526257 the increase in our growth and profitability is the result of the continuous addition of what we believe to be the finest and most professional mortgage brokers in the business and the focused commitment to the execution of our business plan
4526258 our consolidation business plan is very attractive especially in environments such as we are in today because we can provide small and medium size brokers access to strategic growth alliances as well as making available a larger lender base this allows the broker to offer more competitive and suitable products to their customers increase their brand power and utilize an infrastructure which will allow them to reduce their expenses by providing centralized back office services as we have proven our business model continues to gain traction and we maintain our focus and dedication to accomplish our overall objective of being north americas largest and most respected mortgage brokerage company

4526263 many people still assume that parenting ends when a child turns 18 but in our culture today there is a longer extension of adolescence
4526264 everything is not lost if you are the parent of a college student and trying to do a better job
4526265 if you are open and ready to listen to what they have to say that will help you build a stronger relationship
4526266 its heartbreaking to think something like that would happen here
4526267 i cannot imagine what would drive somebody to do that
4526268 very strong very determined i dont know what id do in his position im proud of him i can tell you that im proud of him
4526269 the national landlords association welcomes many of the staged reforms the law commission proposes in fact further enhancing good practice to build on voluntary self regulation can only be a good thing for both landlords and tenants
4526270 we are pleased to see the recognition that local authorities have an important role to play in the enforcement of regulation
4526271 the policy of this government is to promote foreign investment and negotiations with each promoter will continue to be the same every time there is an investor proposal either national or from overseas it will be analysed

4526276 he wants to come back here he wants to be welcome back here
4526277 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim
4526278 it just looks like a costume with some fake guys thrown on top for effect
4526279 its not on endangered species on any list that weve got
4526280 the remains of a small gorilla or chimpanzee that may have undergone some taxidermy treatment
4526281 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4526282 you are dealing with a people who despise anyting human
4526283 we need to do our utmost to deter such behavior in the future
4526284 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4526285 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4526286 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4526287 affordability relatively speaking is way up and thats driving the lower end of the market the reo real estate owned or repossessed homes market is robust and the low end is robust theres some languishing in the higher end where the credit crunch is still a problem
4526288 my clients are buying properties well below their peaks i just closed today on a condo downtown san jose that was purchased two years ago for 460 000 my borrower bought it for 340 000
4526289 the homes that were selling slow in the lower price range that segment is improving slowly the higher end market that was doing well is still doing well but less well than it was
4526290 there are markets and there are markets some markets are good for buying others are good for selling
4526291 the market is really alive and well depending upon what segment you are looking at
4526292 the active demand to purchase properties is still showing a climbing trend especially with respect to lower priced and reo properties
4526293 this current time is perhaps the best time to buy in nearly 20 years there is twice the normal inventory of homes for sale and there is an overwhelming amount of foreclosures on the market
4526294 it still seems to ring true that pricing your home right is hugely important an overpriced home just sits and sits i dont understand why people dont start with a lower price when the owner finally decides to lower the price it gets labeled as a problem property
4526295 and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers

4526298 compromised the objectivity necessary to dispassionately and fairly evaluate the evidence and prepare the post trial evaluation
4526299 i have seen yellowish and small leaves on some of my cassava crops but i did not take it seriously
4526300 but the trainer demonstrated that this is mosaic disease i now know that once i identify such crops i have to uproot them immediately and destroy them by burning them also when planting the stems from such crops should not be planted because the resulting planst would automatically be infected
4526301 what does that one look like if it has such a name
4526302 these are the problems which reduce yields and in some cases wipe out a whole crop
4526303 let us run with endurance the race that is set before us
4526304 those who wait on the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings like eagles
4526305 when they hear the word they immediately receive it with gladness but they have no root in themselves and so endure only for a time
4526306 he shall be like a tree planted by the waters which spreads out its roots by the river and will not fear when heat comes but its leaf will be green and will not be anxcious in the year of drought nor will cease from yeidling fruit
4526307 if he wasnt in the sport of swimming i dont think id be as good just because hes up there and i just want to become better than him
4526308 so it helps me it pushes me in practice and everything i can say without him i wouldnt be where i am right now
4526309 stoke city football club are delighted to announce the signing of newcastle united defender abdoulaye faye for a fee of 2 250 000
4526310 abdoulaye is a fantastic player with top flight experience in abundance
4526311 cardaccio is fast very durable and strong in the air
4526312 his best position is just in front of the defence
4526313 viudez is a great talent he is an excellent signing for the future
4526314 he is a man of the area an attacker who will score 15 goals in the championship
4526315 but do not compare him to inzaghi he is different fornaroli is not as fast but he is a centre forward who is always a second ahead of his marker his anticipation is his greatest asset
4526316 i saw many games in pre season and if you say only one or two teams can win it i think you are wrong i saw a minimum of eight teams playing very well
4526317 there are three or four other clubs outside the top four who have good teams like tottenham and portsmouth who are strong teams
4526318 yesterday i saw manchester city and just because they lost doesnt mean they are not a good team
4526319 all the games here are important and difficult games unlike in other leagues where you have two or three teams only and you win 15 out of 20 games
4526320 here you can never be sure you will win a game and that is exciting every week you have a new challenge
4526321 there are a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4526322 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4526323 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4526324 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4526325 these unsubstantiated spate of reports are totally baseless and malicious
4526326 once they issue impeachment proceedings against him and issue a charge sheet then it will become almost inevitable that he will want to answer those charges
4526327 he feels very strongly that a lot of that is being said is not correct
4526328 we have conveyed to them that the coalition is determined for impeachment and if he wants to save himself the best way is for him to quit
4526329 if a person moves to the side we are not in the habit of bothering him this would not be a good attitude if someone is lying on the ground and we go aggressively against him
4526330 i wanted to go out and win this for my father
4526331 its just so cool that he was in the olympics 20 years ago and i wanted to bring home the all around medal he almost won

4526343 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
4526344 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
4526345 among my favorite sessions i feel the things we did together were dynamite
4526346 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4526347 they introduced themselves and at that time he pulled out a handgun and shot chairman gwatney several times
4526348 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidante
4526349 michelle and i are heartbroken to hear about the tragic loss of chairman bill gwatney were praying for his family and friends and all who worked with him and loved him
4526350 it makes you wonder what got into somebody to do something so horrible
4526351 bill gwatney was our friend our partys leader and so many times our partys conscience
4526352 our state and our party are better for all that bill gwatney has done
4526353 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend
4526354 there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney

4526358 iets meer dan 26 procent van de informatieve e mails voornamelijk nieuwsletters met redactionele inhoud uit de toeristische sector worden volgens cabestan geopend
4526359 dat is evenveel als het gemiddelde van alle consumentensectoren maar het percentage toeristische campagnes waarbij daar op wordt doorgeklikt ligt duidelijk lager dan het gemiddelde in de toerisme wordt slechts in 8 procent van alle gevallen doorgeklikt het gemiddelde van alle consumentensectoren bedraagt 16 procent
4526360 my own business always bores me to death i prefer other peoples
4526361 the easy online availability of sources has channeled researcher attention from the periphery to the core to the most high status journals in short searching online is more efficient and hyperlinks quickly put researchers in touch with prevailing opinion but they may also accelerate consensus and narrow the range of findings and ideas grappled with by scholars

4526400 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright

4526412 the deployment of new missile defence facilities in europe is aimed against the russian federation

4526420 mas domingo contra belarus vamos entrar com a mesma disposi o e vontade de ganhar
4526421 conseguimos jogar de igual para igual e liderar os tr s primeiros per odos mas no ltimo quarto os detalhes fizeram a diferen a e acabamos sendo derrotadas pela atua o das vice campe s mundiais a nossa equipe pecou pela falta de experi ncia j que temos oito jogadoras que jogam uma olimp ada pela primeira vez

4526423 o andr luis vai voltar a recife onde fez grandes amigos

4526429 o time bom mas precisa ter mais experi ncia principalmente para superar os momentos decisivos s o os detalhes como concentra o e menos erros que fazem a diferen a no final

4526459 id estimate that i see the 3g icon on the phone less than one third of the time in so called 3g areas that i frequent in the bay area and austin texas
4526460 our 3g chips are for example used in samsung handsets and we are not aware of such problems there
4526461 historically apple does not respond to something like this automatically just because there are reports of problems if there is merit to the issue they work overtime to fix it and usually at the point of the fix that is when they respond
4526462 apple prides itself on its customer service reputation and i would be surprised if they dont go the extra mile to make sure anything that impacts that image will be corrected as fast as possible
4526463 apple has had the same problem in every market where the 3g iphone is sold

4526471 i am sure he was toally exhausted with his adventure it was a 14 hour search for me and a good friend of mine drove me all over this city a few times we gave up at about 10 pm and then i got a call at 11 30 that he found and safe
4526472 i had so many wonderful people helping me search mostly strangers it proves to me that there are great people in this city and makes me proud to be a part of it
4526473 the injury allowed me to grasp deep down to something i didnt know existed and use that to its full advantage

4526483 we are delighted that the launch of the film coincides with the launch of such a significant new model for ford of europe
4526484 the addition of this dramatically designed sport wagon is well synchronized with todays changing consumer tastes as a compelling alternative to suvs or other larger vehicles
4526485 this is an important step in cadillacs ongoing global expansion and of course in international markets like europe wagons have been and continue to be very significant
4526486 the cts sport wagon is an important expansion to the cadillac lineup worldwide
4526487 its a taut design that not only suggests sleekness but delivers it
4526488 indeed the drama of the sedan is amplified in the cts sport wagon as the centerline cue that is part of the exterior and interior is more prominent and plays a stronger role in defining the design at the rear of the vehicle
4526489 the more you study the rear of the cts sport wagon the more you see
4526490 functionality was certainly a guiding factor during development but so was the idea to inject emotion into the normally sedate wagon category
4526491 theyre not fins in the classic sense but they work to help disguise the cargo load system and yes they acknowledge cadillacs design heritage

4526501 never mind the yankees current standing in third place or their recent struggles both steinbrenner brothers are now said by people familiar with their thinking to be on board with brian cashman as their general manager for now and long into their future
4526502 a lineup that produced 968 runs last season is on pace for 777 in 2008 that all may be a statistical fluke
4526503 unfortunately theres a fluctuation that can occur and we are dealing with a low spike in that
4526504 one wonders why cashman was the only one excluding of course his apologists and acolytes in the blogosphere who couldnt see the disaster he courted in entrusting 40 to 60 of his rotation to hughes kennedy and joba all three rookie pitchers untested over a full season all three subject to inning caps all three under 24 and as baseball prospectus recently has shown susceptible to injury as a consequence the idea that in the new york crucible amid the pressure and scrutiny of an adversarial press an impatient fan base an outspoken ownership and the hype of the stadium last year three rookie pitchers whod totalled 116 major league innings between them could develop flourish and lead their team to the playoffs seemed even then a fanciful pipe dream at best and deluded folly at worst

4526507 this is one incident among thousands of cases and is the trademark of the burmese armys use of rape as weapon of war in burma
4526508 this is a horrific attack and should remind governments and the united nations of the true nature of this regime
4526509 there is no justice or rule of law in burma
4526510 her parents have already complained at the police station but the local police told them that there is not enough evidence to prove the crime
4526511 this latest tragedy is another example of the grotesque barbarism of the military regime in burma and evidence that despite what the regime tells un envoys they continue to perpetrate crimes against humanity with impunity

4526529 ive spoken all week about how much ive enjoyed the olympic experience how much i love the spirit of it
4526530 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4526531 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself
4526532 fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4526533 i mean its just one point there is an umpire if im 100 percent sure about it i mean i will give it but im not sure
4526534 whatever is going to get him to have some sleep tonight then thats fine

4526548 there can be no talks with the organizers of genocide
4526549 saakashvili was crazy enough to go in the middle of the night and bomb a city
4526550 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed 10 ossetian villages at once who ran over elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilians alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection

4526558 i do bring a lot of aggressiveness to the table
4526559 basically im in the box a lot being a strong safety and i played linebacker in high school so i was so used to being aggressive that i just carried it over to college
4526560 i know a lot more than what i did last training camp so now its just about putting it to use
4526561 personally i just want to be involved in a lot more packages more than i was last season
4526562 so i really just want to be able to get out there and make plays and help the team on defense and on special teams
4526563 talking to coach davis he just wanted guys to come in and play
4526564 he doesnt care who it is it could be a freshman but he just wants guys that can play he said that i would have the opportunity to come in and play early which sounded good to me because i really didnt want to red shirt
4526565 i dont think its really set in but i feel like this journey has been so long
4526566 standing on the podium and hearing olympic champion next to my name was a dream come true
4526567 i just knew that i had to give the routine of my life
4526568 i was pretty far behind but i couldnt control that i gave a great meet today that was probably my favorite moment finishing on floor because i knew i had given it my all and i couldnt change anything
4526569 its a feeling i dont think any father can describe
4526570 just to know that he was so close to the all around gold and didnt quite achieve it
4526571 and i hope you know i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him i hope that this definitely tops it i have a few more to go but it is an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him out on the floor 20 years after he competed i think it just means so much more to both of us i dont know just all the hard work paying off all the injuries tears blood rips everything
4526572 spain came out and played really hard you have to give them credit
4526573 it was a matter that our defense controls so much of what our offense does
4526574 spains a good team they came out really well in the first half
4526575 in the second half we came out defensively and took care of what we had to
4526576 stuff like that happens during a game when both teams are playing physical you just step up hit your free throws and move on
4526577 i had to get a little treatment on the side but once it got warm i was okay
4526578 for us this was a good game its what we wanted to have
4526579 it was great when spain made their run and at the end of the first half were sitting there with a five point lead to see how were going to respond in that situation
4526580 the experience we have along with the young talent we have was a good combination in the second half

4526584 there was one young girl who lost her dad in between the first audition and the judges callback it was her familys wish that she should still go through with the competition
4526585 in a situation like that it is impossible not to get caught up with someones emotions and it became more than a tv story
4526586 in that case it was all about this girls dream and that was her moment in front of the judges to fulfil her fathers wish the cameras dont matter and of course you feel like you have got to look after them and suddenly you dont really care what questions you are asking you are just hoping they get through
4526587 i met a guy who changed his name to sheriff lawton he didnt want to win the x factor to be a popstar he wanted to start his own crime fighting agency to work with the police and needed the 1 million prize money to set it up you couldnt write it

4526598 ive been working on reducing sky high overdraft fees for several years now
4526599 overdraft loans can be useful financial tools but many consumers are being enrolled in costly overdraft protection programs without their consent
4526600 in most cases banking customers can avoid overdrafting their accounts and paying any associated fee by knowing their balances
4526601 they can call pnc and we will automatically exclude them from the convenience of overdraft access for all atm transactions and purchases

4526653 first there was the tibet uprising that was unfortunate but necessary china really needs to do and be seen to be doing more to resolve this internal but yet international blotch on its record and image but several of the other charges and allegations levelled against the host nation and which really had nothing to do with its suitability to host the games were overdone and in poor taste
4526654 for example i can think of no greater form of injustice man to man than for a presidential candidate to be overlooked by a voter a state and perhaps even a country on the basis of gender or the colour of ones skin to me that would rate among the most critical of human right abuses if ever there was a rating or sliding scale

4526662 i wish to bring to the notice of this gathering that some state governments had written the board instructing us to strictly use the universities matriculation examination ume scores for admission purposes in this academic session
4526663 however all other institutions are expected to indicate the model used to combine universities matriculation examination scores with the post universities matriculation examination screening scores used for placement purposes
4526664 for example all the universities are supposed to be at this meeting today but some are just conducting their post ume today and tomorrow and they are expecting jamb to be there its not possible for the post ume the regulation is that jamb must be present
4526665 there is a law guiding this thing you must abide by it when i say that its post ume not necessary i assume that weve all seen that jamb is on track things have changed for the better and ive seen universities who came to me to say that post ume is the same as the ume
4526666 some universities have even written to say that they are not going to do post ume at all because they believe in what jamb is doing all of them are involved in the conduct of the ume exams and they saw it that it was good therefore why should they worry about post ume so all they needed to do was to screen the candidates in terms of certificates are they really qualified to enter the university thats what government asked them to do such that they will now say you have five credits in science or arts to be able to study thats all they expected them to do but unfortunately it has turned out to become a money making venture
4526667 its heartbreaking to think something like that would happen here
4526668 i cannot imagine what would drive somebody to do that

4526687 its quite possible h9n2 is infecting humans quite a lot much more than we appreciate merely because it is beyond the radar
4526688 in humans it is very mild so most of the time its probably not even recognized or biologically tested
4526689 its quite a silent virus its not highly pathogenic and sometimes it causes some morbidity in poultry but by and large it is just there and its unnoticed
4526690 the picture is completely absolutely 100 percent on schedule on time there were no delays

4526699 when it comes to get out the vote efforts the mccain campaign appears to trail the obama campaign in both manpower and spending

4526708 ich bin gl cklich mit den beiden trainingssitzungen heute morgen da alles neu f r mich war konzentrierte ich mich zuerst darauf das motorrad kennen zu lernen am nachmittag verbesserte sich das gef hl dann immens
4526709 der motor ist leistungsf higer und reagiert besser beim beschleunigen aber auch in sachen top speed auch das chassis f hlt sich besser an ich bin gl cklich mit dem neuen motorrad
4526710 ich hatte zwar einen crash aber ich bin wirklich gl cklich ber meine leistung heute speziell im zweiten training am nachmittag fuhren wir mit den reifen die mir das beste gef hl vermittelten und ich habe es geschafft das ganze training ber schnell zu sein
4526711 trotz alledem haben wir jede menge harte arbeit vor uns denn der belag ist neu und wir m ssen noch viele daten sammeln um uns weiter zu entwickeln
4526712 es ist wirklich rgerlich dass es angefangen hat zu regnen f r trockene verh ltnisse h tten wir eine sehr gute abstimmung gehabt
4526713 unter diesen umst nden konnten wir mit unseren erfahrungen weder etwas anfangen noch etwas ausprobieren
4526714 ich habe wirklich alles daran gelegt schneller zu fahren aber es ging nicht
4526715 das ergebnis ist f r mich alles andere als zufriedenstellend somit kann es f r morgen nur ein ziel geben eine gute regenabstimmung hinzubekommen
4526716 wir waren grade drei runden im ersten qualifying draussen da setzte der regen ein
4526717 ich lag zu der zeit auf dem vierten oder f nften platz und so bin ich zur ck in die box nach einer viertelstunde bin ich wieder raus weil die anderen fahrer auf meine zeit gekommen sind zum gl ck habe ich direkt einen guten rhythmus gefunden und konnte schlussendlich auf platz sechs also in die zweite reihe fahren

4526721 one of the most practical benefits of studying latin for high schoolers is boosting verbal skills and scores on tests like the sat students with two or more years of latin typically score 140 160 points higher on the sat than their latin less peers

4526731 our members are already struggling to keep up with rising food and energy costs
4526732 this pay offer is an insult to professional hard working men and women who have to operate in extremely difficult conditions
4526733 our members have had enough the liberalisation of ground handling services across uk airports has resulted in a race to the bottom which must and will stop
4526734 we will not stand back and allow labour costs to determine whether contracts are won or lost
4526735 swissport is aware of the disappointing news that a small number of union members have voted for strike action at gatwick airport
4526736 swissport believes that a fair offer has been made to the unions in the light of the current economic climate that reflects the cost of living increase
4526737 swissport is working with the airport operator and the customer airlines to minimise disruption to the travelling public
4526738 gmb members can not afford these low pay rises given the rising prices they have to pay for food energy and transport
4526739 the employers the airlines and the airport operator need to adjust their view as to what our members will now accept the only way they have of meeting higher prices passed on to them is to raise their own prices in higher pay rises
4526740 these workers are doing one of the most vital jobs in the airport but are among the lowest paid
4526741 i would ask those that have influence within their own community to condemn these people in the strongest possible terms
4526742 it is absolutely sickening that on a day when we are commemorating the dead of omagh there are those who prefer to daub slogans abusing their neighbours and aligning themselves with the people who carried out that atrocity

4526746 these startling figures show that the government is building a national dna database by stealth
4526747 there can be no excuse for storing the dna of innocent adults let alone children who are entirely blameless
4526748 this is an intrusive policy that gives far too much sensitive information to the state when we know that ministers cannot be trusted with its security
4526749 the dna that should be on the database is that of past offenders yet when it comes to them there are major gaps in the database
4526750 this is yet more evidence that the dna database is totally arbitrary with tens of thousands of innocent kids on it but not every offender in our prisons
4526751 this is why we need to have a parliamentary debate on the issue and to put this database on to a statutory basis
4526752 potentially inconsistent and discriminatory and contrary to an individuals privacy rights
4526753 here is everything weve got you dont need to hunt anymore
4526754 it will be clear to everyone now that there is absolutely no evidence that suggests madeleine has been seriously harmed

4526756 our investigators continue to explore credible leads and will continue to do so as long as madeleine is missing
4526757 now that the authorities are no longer looking for madeleine we implore everyone who has provided information to the inquiry to contact us

4526777 corporate travel is ongoing and there are a lot of bargains available in golf vacations now
4526778 these days people are making careful buying decisions and are really concerned about value
4526779 you cannot deny the quality to price quotient that club glove offers our products have been tested week after week and year after year by demanding traveling professionals who want the best products to carry the tools of their trade touring golf professionals have logged over 500 000 miles with club glove golf travel bags without ever needing repairs that says a lot about the quality of our products
4526780 our third quarter results for revenues contracts and backlog reflect the continued weakness in most of our markets
4526781 however we believe there is growing pent up demand from those who have postponed buying during the past three years for example when we run promotions and work the phones for a market our rate of deposits improves significantly
4526782 im really grateful i didnt have to make four picks this morning
4526783 i can assure you it would have been very difficult and honestly i wouldnt know what to do if i had to sit back right now and say these are the four guys i could have gotten burned by it because theres three weeks remaining after this tournament before i get to pick hopefully the four picks will fall right in my lap and it will be obvious i dont think it will be that way and i think picking four guys will be difficult
4526784 we are going to take on an underdog role in this ryder cup for the first time in a long time even on paper when you look at the strength of the european squad
4526785 ive said all along that experience while being very important i mean weve lost five of the last six ryder cups so most of their experiences are bad experiences
4526786 so its not like experience is going to be a great help im looking for guys that are playing well its as simple as that
4526787 hes got that kind of demeanor that you need on the ryder cup team
4526788 you need a bunch of different type of personalities for a ryder cup team to blend and ben curtis is a little more stoic a little more subdued but i like his personality
4526789 this has been a goal of mine for about nine years and its taken a little longer for me to reach it than id like but now that im back on the team ive certainly played a couple but i feel like im going to bring a little bit of not quite youth but you know maybe a little perspective on it that some of the other guys may not have
4526790 im looking forward to getting back to that there are some great memories because of the success that we had on sunday but theres nothing like those butterflies on the first tee of your first match in a ryder cup theres nothing like it
4526791 it was pretty heavy i mean after that morning round of finishing up i really was just like weve got to go out and play some good golf
4526792 we have got to show them that we want to be a part of it and that we can play under pressure and that we can play against all odds you know youre out there playing 36 holes or 30 holes however many holes you played it shows that hey you know youve got the backbone to go out there and do it and i wanted to prove it and i know i could
4526793 in the end theres no super motivational speech you can give to a guy who is playing poorly to get him to play better
4526794 and ive said all along i dont think i can say anything stupid enough to screw a guy up who is playing well so well see how that plays out i think the selection process has worked so far
4526795 im really excited about who we have on the team the next three weeks are going to be really important for the remainder of the pga tour because as i look at it right now anybody can get on this team
4526796 after a strong first half of the year the volatile multiple segment is now readjusting itself
4526797 this brings activity since the start of the year closer in line with our 2008 forecast of more than 200 000 housing starts for the seventh consecutive year
4526798 als we de finale halen loopt dat bedrag al snel op tot ongeveer 9 miljoen voor de knvb is het financieel beter als we de titel dan niet winnen dat scheelt flink in de premies voor de spelers maar dat is natuurlijk alleen maar een rekensommetje

4526886 the eurozone moved closer to recession on thursday after it emerged that the economy contracted in the second quarter for the first time since the launch of the euro yet while concerns mounted in europe that the weakness in growth could prove protracted evidence of growing global inflationary pressures continued to build just hours after the eurozone figures were released us data showed consumer prices rose twice as fast as forecast by economists in july hitting an annual rate of 5 6 per cent the highest since january 1991

4526891 at a time when world records seemed to have hit the ceiling of whats physically possible to wrestle out of the human organism phelps has been the man who managed to push the limits with his magnificent performance
4526892 any average adult human being needs some 2 500 daily calories to live a life without excesses
4526893 of course when youre in the presence of a monster like michael phelps those parameters can go to hell
4526894 the all time no 1 olympian or just one of many such belt holders
4526895 the latter is my conclusion because numbers of golds won is only one criterion by which to weigh olympic greatness not least because of the sheer number of scarcely distinguishable events open to swimmers though phelps will move another giant step towards the all time title on sunday if he puts spitz in the shade
4526896 we couldnt care less whether hes the greatest olympian ever
4526897 the truth is hes costing us a fortune and punters bettors just love him if phelps comes to london in 2012 theres a strong chance he could clean up again frankly were already dreading it
4526898 if michael phelps were a country he would be sitting fourth on the games medal tally
4526899 every olympiad produces its own titans athletes whose performances galvanize the worlds attention and whose names become synonymous in olympic history with the cities and years of their triumphs
4526900 in that sense beijing 2008 will always belong to michael phelps
4526901 increased competition from the existing home market coupled with the elimination of the pent up demand that built up during the 1990s will exert downward pressure on housing starts which will decline to 194 000 units in 2009 from 215 000 in 2008

4526914 we didnt have any real reason to go back and question what we were told initially nobody called us to question that
4526915 there are many situations in which a pilot declares an emergency and in the vast majority of cases the pilot lands the plane safely

4526919 we only had us out dating for about four straight days
4526920 the thing that impressed me most about ryan was he asked all the right questions from day one the thing with ryan is there was never and weve still never spoken about a dollar in the contract
4526921 from day one the questions that he had for me were all about how are we going to win races how we are going to win championships how we are going to get the right people in place to do the right jobs
4526922 its very important to stewart haas racing being able to announce that weve got ryan onboard
4526923 its something that weve all been looking forward to since the day that we first spoke with him and wife krissie about coming over here and joining the team so were just more excited to let everybody else know
4526924 we know what its done for the organisation once we announced that i was coming over the flood of personnel that have come over and wanted to join the team since we made that announcement has been huge and the addition of ryan coming onboard i think its going to make that list even grow larger

4526949 legitimising in the life of the conference and by implication in the communion the whole range of convictions about same sex relationships and about the use of scripture
4526950 strongly coloured by the well organised and well funded activities of groups and individuals lobbying against the communions teaching expressed in resolution 1 10 and for that publicly advocated by the episcopal church and those who think like it
4526951 everything had been managed to ensure that opposing and mutually incompatible views should be held in tension
4526952 best and most fruitful way forward for the anglican communion
4526953 recognition that a covenant clearly has to have some teeth
4526954 a huge achievement the anglican communion has not had over arching structures capable of bearing this strain
4526955 people came to realise that they wanted us at all costs to find ways of staying together in one communion recognising the huge loss if we do not
4526956 the liberal bishops who came to lambeth very doubtful about the concept of the covenant the more conservative bishops and provinces clear it was needed
4526957 one of the key changes in the anglican picture as a result of lambeth is the enhanced authority of archbishop rowan conservatives and liberals alike as well as all those of us who dont fit either label were inspired by his scholarly gentle and holy leadership
4526958 ours was beautifully led by a gentle spirited sudanese bishop anthony poggo

4526973 i decided to take these two weeks off from tournament golf as with automatic qualification now out of the question i thought it very important to put in some serious practice time so i am ready to perform to the best of my ability should i come into the reckoning for a captains selection
4526974 my desire to play in the ryder cup is greater than ever as i have shown in the past and in my schedule which has been geared towards qualifying but i want now to work on my game to compete as well as i can in scotland and to have my game to a standard that would allow me hopefully to perform at a level to help the team if i am part of it to the requisite 14 and a half points
4526975 after these few days with my wife and family i am ready to get down to some serious hard work at gleneagles which is no more than 10 minutes from home so some long hours can easily be put in

4526985 we considered locating the converter stations at arnish but it would require the construction of a large line of transmission towers pylons to link arnish and the windfarm developments in pairc and eishken the environmental effects of such a line were considered to be greater than those associated with the proposed development
4526986 the offer to locate the converter station in eishken was known to us and again was considered unfortunately this required taking a much longer subsea cable through loch sealg or a longer land cable through gravir and glen gravir
4526987 both options were assessed to have greater environmental impacts than the proposed development
4526988 a roads assessment has been completed and whilst the roads are structurally sound you are correct in your assessment that construction vehicles would be likely to damage the edges of the narrow roads
4526989 this is being discussed with the roads authority and we would ensure that the roads are left in a condition at least as good as they are today we propose the construction of a pavement with street lighting to avoid the need for pedestrians to share the roadway with construction vehicles within the village

4526997 berpuasalah kalian karena melihatnya hilal dan berbukalah karena melihatnya hilal bulan syawal jika kalian terhalang awan maka sempurnakanlah syaban tiga puluh hari
4526998 janganlah kalian mendahului bulan ramadhan dengan puasa satu atau dua hari kecuali seseorang diantara kalian yang biasa berpuasa padanya dan janganlah kalian berpuasa sampai melihatnya hilal syawal jika ia hilal terhalang awan maka sempurnakanlah bilangan tiga puluh hari kemudian berbukalah iedul fithri dan satu bulan itu 29 hari
4526999 apabila datang bulan ramadhan amka berpuasalah 30 hari kecuali sebelum itu kalian melihat hilal
4527000 puasalah karena melihatnya hilal dan berbukalah karena melihatnya jika awan menghalangi kalian sempurnakanlah tiga puluh hari jika dua orang saksi mempersaksikan ruyah hilal maka berpuasalah dan berbukalah kalian karenanya
4527001 manusia sedang melihat lihat munculnya hilal aku beritahukan kepada nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam bahwa aku melihatnya maka beliau berpuasa dan memerintahkan manusia untuk berpuasa
4527002 kuraib mengabarkan bahwa ummu fadll bintul harits mengutusnya kepada muawiyyah di syam
4527003 aku sampai di syam kemudian aku memenuhi keperluannya dan diumumkan tentang hilal ramadhan sedangkan aku masih berada di syam
4527004 para ulama berbeda pendapat tentang hal ini atas beberapa pendapat
4527005 keharusan ruyah bagi setiap negeri yang tidak samar atas mereka hilal
4527006 tidak harus sama jika berbeda dua arah yakni tinggi dan rendah yang menyebabkan salah satunya mudah melihat hilal dan yang lain sulit atau bagi setiap negeri mempunyai iklim hal ini diceritakan oleh al mahdi dalam al bahr dari imam yahya dan hadawiyah
4527007 orang orang yang menyatakan bahwa ruyah tidak digunakan bagi semuanya negeri negeri seperti kebanyakan pengikut pengikut madzhab syafii diantaranya mereka ada yang membatasi dengan jarak qashar shalat ada yang membatasi dengan perbedaan mathla seperti hijaz dengan syam iraq dengan khurasan kedua duanya lemah dhaif karena jarak qashar shalat tidak berkaitan dengan hilal apabila seseorang menyaksikan pada malam ke 30 bulan syaban di suatu tempat dekat maupun jauh maka wajib puasa demikian juga kalau menyaksikan hilal pada waktu siang menjelang maghrib maka harus imsak berpuasa untuk waktu yang tersisa sama saja baik satu iklim atau banyak iklim
4527008 apabila penduduk suatu negeri melihat hilal maka seluruh negeri harus mengikutinya
4527009 saya demi allah tidak mengetahui apa yang menghalangi sayyid sabiq sehingga dia memilih pendapat yang syadz ganjil ini dan enggan mengambil keumuman hadits yang shahih dan merupakan pendapat jumhur ulama sebagaimana yang dia sebutkan sendiri
4527010 puasa kalian adalah hari kalian berpuasa dan berbuka kalian iedul fithri adalah hari kalian berbuka tidak berpuasa dan adha kalian adalah hari kalian berkurban
4527011 sanadnya jayyid dan rawi rawinya semuanya tsiqah lihat silsilah al hadits as shahihah 1 440
4527012 sebagian ahlu ilmi ulama mentafsirkan hadits ini bahwa puasa dan iedul fithri bersama mayoritas manusia
4527013 dalam hadits itu terdapat dalil bahwa hari ied ditetapkan bersama manusia orang yang mengetahui hari ied dengan ruyah sendirian wajib baginya untuk mencocoki lainnya dan mengharuskan dia untuk mengikuti mereka didalam shalat iedul fithri dan iedul adha
4527014 dikatakan bahwa di dalam hadits itu terdapat bantahan terhadap orang yang mengatakan bahwa barangsiapa mengetahui terbitnya bulan dengan perkiraan hisab boleh baginya untuk berpuasa dan berbuka berbeda dengan orang yang tidak tahu juga dikatakan makna yang terkandung dalam hadits itu bahwa saksi satu orang apabila melihat hilal sedangkan hakim tidak menerima persaksiannya maka dia tidak boleh berpuasa sebagaimana manusia tidak berpuasa
4527015 yang jelas maknanya adalah bahwa perkara perkara ini bukan untuk perorangan tidak boleh bersendirian dalam hal itu perkaranya tetap diserahkan kepada imam dan jamaah atas dasar ini jika seseorang melihat hilal sedangkan imam menolak persaksiannya maka seharusnya tidak diakui dan wajib atasnya untuk mengikuti jamaah pada yang demikian itu
4527016 nahr adalah hari manusia menyembelih kurban dan iedul fithri adalah hari manusia berbuka
4527017 apa yang sudah menjadi ketetapan sebuah hukum tidak berbeda keadaannya pada orang yang diikuti dalam ruyah hilal sama saja dia seorang mujtahid yang benar atau salah atau melampaui batas tentang masalah apabila hilal tidak tampak dan tidak diumumkan padahal manusia sangat bersemangat mencarinya telah tersebut dalam as shahihah bahwa nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam bersabda tentang para imam mereka para imam shalat bersama kalian jika mereka benar maka pahala bagi kalian dan mereka dan jika salah maka pahala bagi kalian dan dosa atas mereka
4527018 pendapat yang masyhur dalam madzhab imam ahmad adalah wajib puasa pada waktu itu
4527019 apabila kalian melihat hilal ramadhan maka puasalah dan apabila melihatnya hilal syawal maka berbukalah jika mendung atas kalian maka kira kirakanlah
4527020 barang siapa berpuasa pada hari yang diragukan maka dia sungguh telah bermaksiat kepada abul qasim shallallahu alaihi wa sallam
4527021 tidak berpuasa pada saat itu adalah madzhab imam ahmad imam ahmad juga mengatakan bahwa berpuasa pada hari yang diragukan adalah mendahului ramadhan dengan puasa satu hari sungguh nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam telah melarang hal itu yang masih diragukan adalah tentang wajibnya berpuasa pada hari itu padahal tidak wajib dilakukan bahkan yang disunnahkan adalah meninggalkannya kalau dikatakan boleh dua perkara maka sunnah untuk berbuka itu lebih utama
4527022 aku tidak mendapatkan dari ahmad bahwa beliau menegaskan wajibnya dan memerintahkannya maka janganlah pendapat diatas dinisbatkan kepadanya
4527023 tidak diragukan lagi bahwa para peneliti dari kalangan madzhab hambali dan selainnya berpendapat tentang tidak wajibnya berpuasa bahkan dimakruhkan atau diharamkan
4527024 ketahuilah bahwa hari yang diragukan adalah hari ke 30 dari bulan syaban apabila tidak terlihat hilal pada malam itu karena ada awan yang menghalangi atau selainnya bisa jadi saat itu bulan ramadhan atau syaban dan makna hadits ammar dan selainnya menunjukkan atas haramnya puasa pada saat itu
4527025 janganlah kalian dahului ramadhan dengan puasa satu atau dua hari kecuali orang yang biasa berpuasa bertepatan pada hari itu maka puasalah
4527026 barangsiapa berpuasa pada hari yang diragukan maka sungguh dia telah bermaksiat kepada abul qasim qasim shallallahu alaihi wa sallam
4527027 hadits diatas sebagai dalil bahwa shalat ied dilaksanakan hari kedua tatkala waktu ied diketahui dengan jelas sesuadah keluar habis waktu shalat

4527037 in many areas with large concentrations of foreclosure sales homes are being purchased below replacement cost values

4527040 a lot of the candidates will say that they are christian but a lot of times what they stand for or approve is something that i think goes against what the bible stands for
4527041 its hard for me to trust anybody in higher power
4527042 established to promote civil discourse and the common good of all
4527043 religion is pulled out of the equation a little bit
4527044 the primaries proved that americans care deeply about the faith values character and leadership convictions of candidates as much as they do about the issues
4527045 the obama campaign has placed a lot of emphasis on the youth vote
4527046 in the caucus phase there were many more younger voters than you would otherwise expect
4527047 but the increase was explosive this cycle the primary brought young voters margins up 2 to 1 in missouri alone
4527048 from what i have seen so far neither candidate has given me much substance
4527049 hardcore liberals who discuss obamas beliefs at the dinner table
4527050 young people have their peers and friends laying down their lives because of this the war becomes a more saline issue than any other
4527051 the smaller issues arent the issues that are going to make it for our country
4527052 if you look at the 2004 presidential elections religiosity and church attendance were an extremely good predictor of who you voted for
4527053 people with high levels of religiosity were typically republican the exception is african americans they vote overwhelmingly democratic
4527054 in the past there was a clear partisan divide among the evangelical community but this cycle were seeing an extraordinary trend
4527055 evangelicals are seeing that the democratic party is doing a better job with social justice and humanitarian issues so they are voting not according to their religious beliefs
4527056 theres no doubt obama has engaged an eager and energetic younger crowd during this presidential campaign these twenty somethings want to discuss issues beyond abortion and marriage
4527057 politics became an issue when i became a true christian
4527058 we believe that god put whoever he wants in that position so if anything we need to pray for that person and not complain
4527059 its difficult to summarize something so varied in a single quotation
4527060 think the zombies carousing with gentle giant the beatles and queen too
4527061 it shows the trend we have seen that in a weak market h amp m will perform better than the underlying clothing market
4527062 we do not compete on price or promotion regardless of macroeconomic conditions although it may be both easy and tempting to drive short term sales with pricing and promotional efforts
4527063 our ability to protect our bottom line through rigorous expense control and effective inventory management was enhanced by good initial customer response to our new brand launches and the effectiveness of our promotional pricing actions

4527082 some things like expandable windows re sizeable columns and grids can be done in ajax
4527083 but it would take a tremendous amount of coding to customize them would be very difficult those capabilities come natively in the flex apis so instead of having to write this whole set of javascript with html and ajax if you want a collapseable panel you just use a tag and there it is
4527084 the reason coldfusion was popular originally was that the programming was fast
4527085 you dont have to write as many lines of code as you do in java or net in flex its the same way its a tag based language kind of like what microsoft is doing now with silverlight you can do all the basics with tags if you need to do customization you can go in and expand the tag and write a custom component
4527086 with the latest version of coldfusion adobe has made connecting these technologies easier
4527087 when you install coldfusion all the connectors are there already that makes it a lot easier because the configuration was difficult
4527088 as a product it allows you to easily gather data from a database

4527095 in a soa environment there has to be awareness that this is not business as usual
4527096 this is going to drive our business this is going to drive our competitive differentiation so weve got to make sure that were doing everything in our power to get it right that this is not a one off thing
4527097 one of the big things thats emerging with the business analyst role is that they are becoming the conduit of communications between the line of business and the it organization
4527098 they are the point person sitting in the middle they are also the keeper of the true vision of what is going to come to fruition for the line of business theyll go back and forth and act as that conduit of communication
4527099 one of the things we found was that to build a really effective business analyst group you should really hire your business analysts from a variety of places in the organization
4527100 some coming from development some coming from qa some coming from operations some coming from the line of business some coming from the field where a lot of these software applications are actually used
4527101 what we found is that if you have this well rounded business analyst group they will understand how the company works from a variety of perspectives
4527102 they understand the pressures that they are under the sort of deadlines they have to meet
4527103 we found that organizations that had business analysts from a variety of places had more optimized communications back to those previous lines of work where the business analyst once resided
4527104 shepherds business requirements into services and then manages the realization of those services through the it development organization
4527105 even if we focus on the role of an it business analyst it is clear that the scope of the work and nature of their skills differ in significant ways

4527120 the awarding of this exploration licence will benefit the local area and the state
4527121 it will generate funding for infrastructure and services such as hospitals schools and roads
4527122 the nsw government says this is an exploration licence but really its the go ahead for massive coal mines that will rip the heart out of the gunnedah plains
4527123 the government will pocket 675 million but abandon farmers and its responsibility to tackle climate change all for the profits of a foreign owned company
4527124 this study needs to look at the underground and surface water flows of the liverpool plains prior to any further exploration or mining taking place as we are particularly concerned by the governments assertions that strict environmental regulation will prevent any impacts on aquifers
4527125 there are concerns from our members about the impacts of coal mining activities on agriculture and the failure by government to consider these impacts when deciding to release new mining tenements
4527126 the committee has poked its nose out of the pocket of the coal sector long enough to tell the australian community that we will be the ones to carry the can for the mega profitable coal giants
4527127 the government needs to explain why the polluter shouldnt pay for cleaning up its own act and carry the risk of burying carbon pollution
4527128 this is a very important industry for the future of australia for the public interest and for the national interest
4527129 we need to find ways to assist the industry to begin
4527130 we feel that in the longer term situation that governments will become responsible anyway
4527131 australias energy security depends on us balancing australias oil and gas exploration and production capacity with our capacity to capture and store greenhouse gases
4527132 australias energy security depends on us balancing australias oil and gas exploration and production capacity with our capacity to capture and store greenhouse gases
4527133 it is pleasing to see the bipartisan committees endorsement of the governments direction regarding both the importance and potential of ccs technology in australia and my preferred framework to deliver this initiative
4527134 the building will have 250 apartments including 146 one bedroom units 99 two bedroom units and five townhouses that will be built beside a pool and outdoor terrace all of the units will rent at market rates starting at 1 175 per month for the smallest apartments and running to 1 900 per month for the townhouses

4527148 we see the potential and opportunity in digital media services booming in southeast asia we aim to tap into the regional market now that it is ready and developing
4527149 the acquisition is a jumpstart for us to penetrate this business
4527150 a lot of campaigns are undertaking the digital media services from internet mobile phones commercial products and even political campaigns i believe we are in a position to serve this growing segment
4527151 when we say there is no need for import permit for example some at the ground level say there is a certain requirement this needs to be explained clearly to facilitate the approval process
4527152 there is still a gap between the decision on importation and some of the administrative implementation problems on the ground
4527153 the reduction of duties on construction related automation equipment and system would encourage higher dependency on machines and reduce dependency on foreign labour to achieve productivity
4527154 if liberalisation is so limited and narrow the impact would be nullified and the construction industry would be back at square one as far as steel products are concerned
4527155 the three companies are involved in aquaculture production of bio organic fertiliser and tissue culture in high value timber and ornamental plant species
4527156 sabah also has vast oil palm plantations and biomass is one sector that can be further explored empty fruit bunches are just thrown away when these could be used to create bio fuel products
4527157 its a break of an important psychological support its not a good sign
4527158 smes should enhance their skills knowledge and research and development upgrade their information and communication technology based systems and strengthen their capability and capacity building
4527159 asean is also negotiating on mutual recognition arrangements mras to facilitate freer movement of professional services within the region

4527179 theres been quite substantial snowfall in the last 36 hours
4527180 avalanche conditions have deteriorated in the duration of their trip thats not uncommon
4527181 the snow is known to be very unstable and the boom of the blades is enough to set an avalanche off
4527182 they will be going down to get a closer detail on what efforts are being made and whats going on without interfering with the rescue effort obviously
4527183 its going to be cold but if youve gone and prepared for more than one day then theres every chance of doing well in these situations

4527201 the expanding number of towns with positive mosquitoes along with infected mosquitoes being collected from multiple trapping sites within the community is beginning to concern me
4527202 when the virus appeared much earlier than usual we realized that this could be a long season however the summer is not over yet
4527203 as it stands right now the potential for virus transmission to the general public is increasing rapidly but could become more severe if adult mosquito populations explode with infection at this time it is important for all residents to know about west nile virus and for the town to continue larviciding however if the problem escalates other measures to protect human health will need to be considered
4527204 controlling the mosquito population in the larval stage through the application of larvicide has been proven effective however this measure only reduces the mosquito population not eliminate it at this point the best way to protect yourself against west nile virus is to practice personal protection measures

4527217 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4527267 id have responded to that because theyd have been owning that request
4527268 he spent 30 minutes telling me peter couldnt win he had more show of winning than peter
4527269 i found none of it compelling i spent 30 minutes putting my case and he spent 30 minutes responding
4527270 if my senior colleagues were as a group prepared to own a request for me to go id have gone
4527271 but i was not going to out of the blue go because i didnt think that would have produced a different result and that i would have rightly been criticised for cowardice
4527272 i just tried to go out and pitch well again thats it
4527273 weve got a lot of pride here i just wanted to make sure we didnt get lulled to sleep
4527274 you cant always have a good performance but you can come here and play hard
4527275 waters was a different pitcher today his location was up
4527276 we have to play better i know we played some pretty good teams but were going to have to beat the good teams if were going to be able to get to the playoffs
4527277 weve got three days at home and were going to have to turn it around and make up for it right now
4527278 i dont believe ive ever seen that especially between two pitchers
4527279 things go easier you have more fun im going to continue to just ride it out
4527280 and what i have to do to give myself the best chance to win
4527281 tex has given us an added dimension with his power from both sides and his ability to get on base
4527282 hes brought something to that grouping in front of vladimir guerrero torii hunter and garret anderson
4527283 there were a couple of pitches i left out over the plate that i wish i could take back
4527284 his velocity isnt the same hes not quite back to where he was a couple of years ago but with what he has he is probably better than a lot of guys he is a force on the mound
4527285 thats what we set out to do ever since spring
4527286 i can talk about the starting rotation every time we cross the line we want to do our best maybe half of the team dont have that mentality
4527287 the angels usually find a way to win and thats what we need to do not just be satisfied to play with teams of that caliber
4527288 thats what interim manager jim rigglemans been stressing to us every game that were capable of being a really good team
4527289 weve not been able to take advantage of teams under 500 this time we really approached them the same way we approached the phillies and the teams in contention
4527290 we cant continue to perform this way late in the game
4527291 we have to make some adjustments i have to figure out what i have and who is willing to step up in those roles
4527292 it was one of those nights where we didnt get the big hit like we have
4527293 i dont really care who it is i dont like losing
4527294 i didnt perform today and i didnt give the team a chance from that standpoint its frustrating
4527295 i like what he did against an offensive phillies team hes got the weapons to pitch with
4527296 it was kind of cool to sit back there and watch all that happen
4527297 hopefully we can turn that around and keep playing baseball the way we have for the past few days
4527298 this type of win is whats been happening since early in the season when we started win a lot of games late
4527299 weve got our confidence up and we believe as long as we go on that field weve got a chance to win
4527300 of course youre embarrassed were all embarrassed because we feel were better than that
4527301 you just prepare yourself the only thing you do different is vary your work in between starts ive never had a problem with pitch counts
4527302 winning three of four is huge especially with milwaukee losing
4527303 hes benefited from a productive team and hes taken advantage
4527304 hopefully i can go out there and throw up some quality and quick innings

4527533 you can talk to people about quitting smoking but you may not have a months worth of time before you try to save their life with heart surgery
4527534 with the advent of things like chantix we have a much higher success rate
4527535 i want it to look great for you as well as for myself if they smoke even one cigarette i run the risk of it not healing its like trying to water your lawn with a crimped hose
4527536 this is not a prime driver of quitting in america
4527537 these are all adults and im not going to be the person looking over their shoulders
4527538 this was like the first major surgery id had as an adult
4527539 so when my doctor who i respect tells me not to smoke and here are some reasons why then i have to respect that
4527540 they see the wound opening up turning red or black the edges start coming apart
4527541 they see the skin graft we use to put it back together
4527542 i was afraid the anesthesia would go wrong or id wake up coughing my head off and split my guts open
4527543 ive never seen anything like this all of us going down like this
4527544 my straight line running is good but lateral is decent im still working on my push off to get that back
4527545 its a real tough injury it gets you down a little bit because its my senior year and i dont want any injuries but its cool
4527546 so everybody out there its corvey c o r v e y not corey but its ok i know theyre talking about me i know what theyre trying to say
4527547 shes healthy and alert and knows whats going on around her
4527548 it is giving that last opportunity to come forward and have some involvement in determining her future
4527549 police say it was a fleeting conversation but one that may be crucial
4527550 would you believe a major software vendor released a patch for their flagship program that made it impossible to run their software

4527553 it shows the trend we have seen that in a weak market h amp m will perform better than the underlying clothing market
4527554 we do not compete on price or promotion regardless of macroeconomic conditions although it may be both easy and tempting to drive short term sales with pricing and promotional efforts
4527555 our ability to protect our bottom line through rigorous expense control and effective inventory management was enhanced by good initial customer response to our new brand launches and the effectiveness of our promotional pricing actions

4527575 more than ever before this series of torchwood will be director led and it will look absolutely amazing
4527576 maybe we could do torchwood sex toys i will suggest it
4527577 torchwood has really reached out to audiences worldwide and the fact its moved up the channels on the bbc is incredible
4527578 its an exciting thing to be a part of we have done a read through of the first three episodes and start filming next week
4527579 we heard a similar story quite often if a doctor retired or died or there was a merger or another practice took over the patients they patients would have difficulty getting their records back to take to another doctor
4527580 there were even stories of records being found in the rubbish bin in the doctors garage or even on the footpath
4527581 we found that all through our enquiry we would hear peoples stories and say what there were no rules or the rules would not accord with what most people would consider common sense
4527582 i think people wanted simplification and harmonisation in this area and thats what we have tried to deliver
4527583 we know the nhmrc was interested in us not making it more difficult to do research certainly i think they will be pleased with these recommendations and i think we have found a good balance between facilitating more research and respecting individuals privacy
4527584 upon request by your patient make available to another doctor a report of your findings and treatment
4527585 i would like to take this opportunity to apologise to him his friends and family for any distortion of public opinion or distress that my comments may have had and i hope this letter serves to go some way to correct that

4527621 many ossetians i met both in tskhinvali and in the main refugee camp in russia are furious about what has happened to their city
4527622 they are very clear who they blame georgias president mikhail saakashvili who sent troops to re take control of this breakaway region
4527623 witness accounts and the timing of the damage would point to georgian fire accounting for much of the damage described in tskhinvali

4527631 with this blog were opening up a two way discussion about how we are making windows 7
4527632 we strongly believe that success for windows 7 includes an open and honest and two way discussion about how we balance all of these interests and deliver software on the scale of windows we promise and will deliver such a dialog with this blog
4527633 not set expectations around the release that end up disappointing
4527634 features that dont make it claims that dont stick or support we dont provide
4527635 we can already hear apple and pessimists saying that windows 7 will be little more than a giant windows vista patch that uses multi touch support as a sales pitch
4527636 apple said it will optimize os code re write it for full 64 bit support and support gpus for general purpose processing tasks

4527639 the flights could not operate if these strikes go ahead it would effectively shut down the airlines operations
4527640 the airlines and swissport will attempt to draft in management and where possible use non unionised workers there will be a risk of delays and this is worst time of year for it to happen at the peak of the summer season when flights are their fullest
4527641 our members are already struggling to keep up with rising food and energy costs this pay offer is an insult to professional hard working men and women who have to operate in extremely difficult conditions our members have had enough

4527646 we are travelling to south africa with president mugabe today as the negotiations continue

4527651 there will be a great sigh of relief in nato circles that khalid will be gone
4527652 the army particularly is whats important because nato diplomats and nato officials have all complained bitterly about the corruption of the afghan police and mr khalid was particularly tied to the police
4527653 i was playing first 15 for the school and i wasnt getting game time i was getting like 10 minutes a game and one of my mates asked if i wanted to play in his team
4527654 i just went along and started playing and then got asked to trial for the wellington league team and made it and from there it was all go
4527655 i never thought sets of six were planned up i thought it was everyone doing whatever they want
4527656 that was the hardest bit along with getting back 10m on defence
4527657 i was aiming for it but i didnt think i would make it i didnt even think i would get a starting spot for the under 20s and luckily there were a couple of injuries that got me a starting spot
4527658 when i first came up i was way overweight and way unfit and the pre season did me real good
4527659 i was willing to learn off players and how they run their lives like ruben wiki and steve price and logan swann
4527660 i think ivans slowly building a lot of faith in me which is pretty good for me to get more minutes
4527661 ive seen him play quite a lot and i played against him on my debut match hes a hard guy to tackle
4527662 theyve got players like brett kimmorley paul gallen greg bird theyve got a couple of big hard running centres and they kick well and finish their sets well all the things that we try and do really
4527663 a lot happens around gallen and bird and theyve got a good player at fullback whos in good form in brett kearney
4527664 you know what they the springbok loose trio are going to do schalk burger certainly makes his physical presence felt in the way he hits first of all in defence and then the way he gets to the breakdown you certainly know hes there
4527665 australias george smith is a bit different in that he picks his times a bit more but when he does hit the ruck hes pretty effective
4527666 they smith and burger are different but its the same with me the way we operate depends whether we are going forwards or backwards at the breakdown that determines how well you can do your job
4527667 the whole game will be pretty physical to be honest its always the way when you play the springboks i know that whatever the score is everyones usually pretty sore at the after match but it hurts a lot less when you win
4527668 we had an extra day here without playing the week before so this test we have been thinking about a bit longer than usual so by wednesday it felt like the week was going pretty slow
4527669 but weve got all our preparation done and i think now the guys are just looking forward to playing this test you can only get so much done
4527670 im looking forward to it i cant wait three oclock kick off so it will come around really quickly tomorrow
4527671 i know theres been a change in the coaching style and the up front nature that he de villiers has
4527672 whether thats one of his strategies to try to create an attitude that we the all blacks are not as good as people think im not too sure
4527673 they have always been massive contests and there have never been any easy ones whether thats slipped a bit i cant answer that i dont know
4527674 im not like your fella who likes to talk about the other team all the time i only have a sense for my team and what they are trying to do
4527675 weve had a good week done a lot of homework worked hard and the players are now preparing themselves mentally to be where they need to be
4527676 whatever they do is up to them but they have the responsibility to get there
4527677 the biggest challenge is sunday monday tuesday and the amount of preparation work
4527678 they are important days for getting the strategy right to get it across well to not overload the players thats the biggest challenge weekly getting those days right and setting it up so the players can enter this period in the right space so they can get it right and unleash at newlands
4527679 i think it is a step up its a challenge to us to reach the level we did in auckland and surpass it there are a lot of doubters around who doubt the team has the heart to do it again but thats the challenge to take that level and intensity offshore and put it on the field at newlands
4527680 its going to be crucial that we get off to a good start and then get on a run at some stage during the season
4527681 weve got a great opportunity to go for maximum points in those two games tomorrow and at home to melbourne next sunday but in saying that if it doesnt come off its not going to be the end of our season
4527682 i think weve got the quality in the squad you have to back what ricki has brought in weve got options
4527683 my body is in order and thats really important for me
4527684 for the last few years ive been doing my back in and getting injured and frustrated but i feel like ive got a brand new back now after the operation i had before the super 14 obviously this is my last campaign with canterbury and its really important to me to do well
4527685 winning the super 14 was my first goal and this is my last so this would be right up there if we win the championship and im just going to throw every bit of energy i have inside me into this campaign
4527686 i guess im getting a bit old now and i took that into consideration the last couple of ops on my back came into consideration as well and also my wife shes a teacher by trade so shell either tutor or teach english over there
4527687 thats what im really aiming at hopefully it will get my body back into top nick and ill get a couple of years under my belt and then see how im feeling
4527688 if i love it in japan ill probably stay on if not ill move on to europe or wherever i can
4527689 off the top of my head i think ive got five six or maybe seven years left in me ill just go as far as my body will take me
4527690 time in the black jersey comes and goes and i guess my time has finished
4527691 guys who know me they know me as a pretty cruisy guy so i didnt ask for explanations or anything like that

4527694 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4527695 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4527696 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4527697 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4527698 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4527756 but the fact remains they are untested and we have doubts whether pakistan could deliver on those plans getting eight teams around to training and games in two centres is a massive logistical exercise and with the current situation there i dont know if the military could handle it
4527757 its not always just about bombs going off there were no bombs in kenya 2003 but we had information that al qaeda terrorist cells were operating there and it was unsafe to tour
4527758 our guys listened patiently and asked some very pertinent questions i thought but i didnt get the impression that any of them were convinced about the safety of the situation
4527759 its a very big compliment to receive from coaches of that calibre
4527760 i dont read too much into it though it has been a difficult year so far and i just want to get back to my top form
4527761 that made it slightly difficult because its hard to show what you can do just in training

4527768 you have to be willing to take your happiness and most times you have to rip it out the jaws of someone else
4527769 most people are unhappy because they lack the courage to dig deep down and change what they are unhappy about i tried so hard for so long to put my happiness in the hands of someone else somewhere else and then i finally got tired of that

4527775 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4527776 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them

4527780 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright
4527781 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4527782 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
4527783 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
4527784 among my favorite sessions i feel the things we did together were dynamite
4527785 i was obviously hoping to go into the next day with a win so im very happy where i am

4527794 we are integrating with the iraqi security forces to make us a better fighting force
4527795 they have stepped up to the plate and their partnership is why we are able to take over the mission that the georgians had to leave behind with no change in the security and safety of the iraqi people

4527812 my drunken purchase of a ps3 last year its really good as a media streamer thank god
4527813 until this week the sophomore had been running no 3 in drills at uh and truth be told if rausch had come out of witness protection he couldnt have been more of a mystery to a great many people it wasnt until last year as a redshirt freshman at cod in palm desert calif where he threw for more than 2 600 yards and 28 touchdowns that rausch played 11 man football his previous experience had been as a three year starter at desert chapel christian school then a 90 student private school where he played both ways on the eight man football team
4527814 consider that rausch played his jc home games in a stadium seating 1 000 actual crowds were probably a hundred times smaller than what will scream back at him in two weeks in the swamp where capacity is listed at 88 548
4527815 rausch did great he made some great throws he knows where to go with the ball the guys buy into his personality hes vocal hes confident he wanted it
4527816 brent keeps going like this rolo raised his left hand in an upward step motion when you look at it day by day the graph goes up
4527817 lets see what hes got lets give him a chance
4527818 it was agreed that rausch for the first time in training camp would be the leadoff quarterback in the passing drills
4527819 indeed he came out firing yesterday lasering completion after completion in the red zone drill he also excelled in the two minute drill to add to the drama the defense was allowed to blitz and the offense was told it had to use silent counts against an aggressive defense and the clock graduate assistant craig stutzmann would yell out the dwindling time rausch remained poised completing passes to the flats and downfield
4527820 i love the way he throws hes very accurate he has a strong arm he throws a pretty ball he controls it he knows where he wants it and he puts it there
4527821 rolovich also is impressed with rauschs u turn in attitude entering training camp last week it was decided the rotation would go like this funaki a fourth year junior who exited spring training as the co no 1 quarterback alexander a junior college transfer who has only two years to play two seasons and then rausch who has three years to play three seasons
4527822 i had to suck it up quit being a little baby im glad he put it on me like that
4527823 i was stressing too hard about making my throws i couldnt relax i was down on myself i definitely was i thought i was going to be third string then stuff started coming together i came out of my shell now i can relax look around and make my throws
4527824 his neighborhood high school football team was led by a 5 foot 7 220 pound quarterback who was the head coachs son figuring he would not play much at that school he instead enrolled at desert chapel high in palm springs calif that school competed in an eight man on a side football league the offense did not have tackles or a fullback when four receivers were used rausch was alone in the backfield with little protection
4527825 it was pretty fun i was a running back and quarterback in high school
4527826 he then attended college of the desert for two years playing football 11 on 11 for the first time in years for one season dan morrison who was uhs quarterbacks coach last year spoke highly of rausch to rolovich who was an assistant coach at city college of san francisco after morrison left uh to join june jones new coaching staff at southern methodist rolovich was hired as the warriors quarterbacks coach in january rolovich remembered rausch and made the recommendation to lee and mcmackin rausch had visited uh on a family vacation the week before receiving the scholarship offer
4527827 its a good school i watched them a lot on television last year i love their offense its a good place for me being a passing quarterback im not much of a runner
4527828 its always good to have a challenge it makes everyone better
4527829 in the final twist smu made a scholarship offer the day rausch signed a national letter of intent with uh
4527830 he didnt even tell me about it until the day i signed it didnt get to me but i didnt even consider going to texas
4527831 i dont want to be compared to him hes a great quarterback he definitely has a different style hes definitely better than me
4527832 texas tech wants to call itself quarterback u or whatever but coming after colt brennan is not the easiest job in the world the successor needs to understand the importance in this state that is a lot of pressure somebody has to handle it
4527833 brian griese struggled with it in denver those are the experiences that i can vocalize the people of this state have a passion for this football team especially for this position
4527834 there is one guy who has gotten better every day i think we have a guy i think is going to continue to get better we made that decision its not an easy decision but were confident in it and i just want to talk to the players first
4527835 we feel one of the guys has moved in front and were going to make a move its important for our football team to have a guy they can rally around and its also important he gets the reps with the first team well start practicing that way today we dont start game planning against florida until next week so we had the weekend but were ready to make a decision and its time to move on
4527836 if rausch starts at the swamp in his first division i game itll mark a remarkable swing for someone who was playing 8 man high school football in california just two seasons ago and didnt play quarterback until his junior year
4527837 now i can see the defense moving and setting up and i can read it a lot better now it did all of a sudden click for me
4527838 thats what we wanted we wanted a slow incline it didnt have to be you know everything right away but you had to get better every day and hes one guy who did
4527839 hes always thrown a good ball it looks like hes making his reads and has more confidence
4527840 not at all i threw a few good passes and they just kept me going the next drill came up and i went first i was too happy to be surprised

4527876 the flights could not operate if these strikes go ahead it would effectively shut down the airlines operations
4527877 the airlines and swissport will attempt to draft in management and where possible use non unionised workers there will be a risk of delays and this is worst time of year for it to happen at the peak of the summer season when flights are their fullest
4527878 our members are already struggling to keep up with rising food and energy costs this pay offer is an insult to professional hard working men and women who have to operate in extremely difficult conditions our members have had enough
4527879 this strike is totally unjustified union chiefs should be grateful that they are getting any increase at all at a challenging time for the global economy
4527880 jika kami yakin maka segala sesuatu mungkin saja terjadi dengan dukungan dari pendukung kami bisa menuju roma untuk memainkan partai final fans telah menunjukkan kecintaan dan saya yakin mereka bisa memberikan energi tambahan untuk melangkah lebih jauh
4527881 jika fans dekat kami bisa memberikan lebih dari 100 persen saya pikir kami mempunyai harapan yang besar untuk liga champions dan kami bisa menggenggamnya memang ada banyak tim yang lebih kuat dan terorganisir dari kami namun tim yang terkuat tidak selalu menjadi pemenang
4527882 kita akan mempelajari terlebih dahulu karena masih ada waktu 14 hari jadi akan dilanjutkan ke rapat selanjutnya
4527883 akhirnya setidaknya kami akan memperoleh medali perak saya sangat puas dan sangat bangga dengan tim saya
4527884 saya merasa tugas kami sudah terpenuhi karena kami menganggap pertandingan menghadapi korea sebagai pertandingan final setelah bekerja di singapura selama dua tahun saya senang dapat membantu negara ini mengakhiri paceklik medali selama 48 tahun
4527885 di saat situasi kritis dan semua orang gugup saya beruntung memiliki kelebihan yaitu ketenangan
4527886 apakah kami harus siap membunuh orang demi memenangkan pertandingan tidak sebab anda harus menghormati aturan permainan keindahan dalah pertandingan adalah meraih kemenangan dengan tetap menghormati aturan permainan
4527887 apakah anda bisa memenangkan kompetisi dengan menerapkan permainan antisepakbola saya tak percaya itu bisa menjadi cara terbaik sejarah telah mengajarkan tim yang akhirnya menjuarai kompetisi adalah mereka yang memiliki teknik lebih baik
4527888 klub klub besar harus menjadi contoh dalam menerapkan permainan yang atraktif mereka tak akan bisa mencapai target dengan menerapkan permainan kotor di awal kompetisi selalu menyenangkan karena semua orang saling menghormati begitu poin poin sudah mulai ada situasinya akan sedikit berubah namun yang terpenting adalah aksi dalam pertandingan
4527889 memang kadang aneh ketika anda pergi ke gereja pada hari minggu pendeta mengatakan kepada semua orang untuk saling menghormati dan menyemangati tapi begitu keluar dari gereja hal itu tak terjadi
4527890 memang kami kehilangan beberapa pemain tapi juga kedatangan beberpa pemain kami memilih untuk memantapkan stabilitas tim di musim ini mari kita fokus pada rencana jangka pendek kemudian belajar dari kesalahan musim lalu kami akan memamerkan permainan yang baik dan menginginkan kemenangan sejak pertandingan pertama

4527908 i think carol is holding on to him as long as she possibly can for me
4527909 the problem is that i know that means if hes taking up a spot that could mean she has to choose another dog to euthanize so id prefer him out of there so it doesnt mean the life of another

4527917 our water quality programs are consistently singled out as national models
4527918 the agency of natural resources already is discussing with epa how to continuously improve our groundbreaking water quality programs
4527919 there have been numerous attempts in various forums over many years to work with the agency of natural resources on improving its clean water act programs but these efforts have been unsuccessful
4527920 we have tried every possible avenue to initiate dialogue with the state to ask the legislature to get involved to avoid formal action
4527921 not to pass judgment on this petition but overall vermont has a pretty strong water quality program

4527933 the senate is currently conducting an internal investigation in an attempt to discover who is behind this once we learn their identity that information will be turned over to law enforcement and we would expect it to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law

4527942 we know what sort of lamb our customers in this market want requirements will change from country to country and this is the breed of sheep we think will supply that the second aspect is timing and we can help with that too if you can grow your lambs to a certain weight by a certain time we will contract to buy them from you
4527943 we have lambs we want finished to a certain weight in a certain time and we will match what the dairy industry will pay you for your grass
4527944 i dont think there is a lot of worse news that could happen
4527945 if interest rates fall and the housing market picks up that would be positive once we get through an election get some stability that could be positive they all could be positive but they all might not
4527946 you might go to the supermarket and say to somebody what sort of potatoes are these and theyll say dirty ones out of the garden whereas id like to think that we might give you a more sincere and satisfactory answer
4527947 im not saying we go home and watch dvds about vegetables all night but weve got a little bit more of a speciality than a supermarket
4527948 the problem for retailers is such a high proportion of our costs are fixed you still have to pay your rent and youve still got to have people to open doors at the store
4527949 its a much more level playing field and thats proved to be the case in that the tasman is 40 bigger than when we first came here and that traffics being shared with all the carriers
4527950 thats getting into wide bodied aircraft country which is not where we are
4527951 we never say never its been a hugely exciting ride with an amazing company driven by some very innovative and entrepreneurial minds and to have that opportunity to deliver it as we have and have it accepted in the new zealand travel market place has been the icing on the cake
4527952 they need to be able to lock in a bigger passenger base that entails being able to offer a wider service
4527953 id expect them to try and use their networks in australia and to new zealand to lock passengers into v australia theyll look to expand those services to probably san francisco and certainly from melbourne
4527954 if you look at each of those entities qantas jetstar virgin blue group tiger and even air new zealand theyre all very strong
4527955 its just a case of everyones going to weather this one out
4527956 the industry is very resilient we think that airline passenger numbers will grow around 4 per year
4527957 it would suggest to me its become an absolute commodity people wake up on friday morning and say what will we do will we go to the movies or will we go to the gold coast and the price point virtually makes them able to make that choice
4527958 youre not going to stop generation x and y on what they want to do
4527959 it certainly gets your attention to make sure the stuff you dont need to be spending is not spent
4527960 i would say airlines whose cost bases are driven by legacy things including labour agreements are going to find it more difficult than somebody with the agility that we have
4527961 youre better to spend very large amounts of money upfront on the fuel efficient airplane and you also get benefits of lower maintenance
4527962 the next step in times of difficult outlook is a wee bit of a challenge but we are brave enough given where were at to take more first mover advantage into markets just look at auckland sydney where there isnt any more room for more of the same but there is room for a new bright energetic product at a price point that does attract people
4527963 if flights are not leaving on time somethings probably out of whack i call it the balance of imperatives commercial and operational imperatives have to remain in sync
4527964 i wouldnt want to comment on any of our activity on that

4528188 polymer pen lithography uses arrays of tiny pens made of polymers to print over large areas with nanoscopic through macroscopic resolution
4528189 in the case of the olympic logo the researchers started with a bitmap image of the logo and uniformly printed 15 000 replicas onto a gold substrate using an ink of the molecule 16 mercaptohexadecanoic acid the ink is a mere one molecule thick this took less than 40 minutes the logo is so small that 2 500 of them would fit on a single grain of rice the letters and numbers beijing 2008 were generated from approximately 20 000 dots that were 90 nanometers in diameter then with more force applied to the pens the stylized human figure and the olympic rings were made from approximately 4 000 dots that were 600 nanometers in diameter
4528190 uses arrays of pyramid shaped polymer pens whose tips are dipped in solutions of chemicals that may feature almost any molecule including proteins and acids the pens are then traced over a surface by a mechanical arm to create millions of structures in parallel the width of the lines drawn by each pen can be carefully controlled by varying the force exerted on the flexible pen tips because mirkins pens trace out designs programmed by computer software they can quickly switch between complicated designs making possible the creation of complex patterns whose features are very close together
4528191 polymer pen lithography is an improvement over dip pen lithography a technique that mirkin has been developing since 1999 dip pen lithography uses arrays of sharp stiff cantilevered probes the same ones used for atomic force microscopy mirkin created a company nanoink to commercialize the technology but he acknowledges its ultimate utility has been limited by problems with throughput cost and complexity the size of its molecular strokes has been restricted to a relatively narrow range the cantilevers are prone to breaking and the number of structures that can be made in parallel is limited
4528192 will make the dip pen technology accessible to a large number of people
4528193 we report a low cost high throughput scanning probe lithography method that uses a soft elastomeric tip array rather than tips mounted on individual cantilevers to deliver inks to a surface in a
4528194 there are 3 technologies available for this pre release each will have its own installer
4528195 active storage platform this pre release package enables the windows platform to restrict access to portable devices such as a usb flash device via a certificate or password authentication based on the ieee 1667 standard specification
4528196 image mastering api update for blu ray media this feature enables the windows platform to do master style optical burning on blu ray media
4528197 smart card driver this release provides support for new form factors such as iccd ccid
4528198 the forthcoming storage pack release is a follow on to the feature pack released in 2007 which provided down level optical platform support the current feature pack plans to update the optical platform as well as provide support for some additional storage devices the release plans have not been announced
4528199 its going to be one of these free updates that doesnt necessarily create a lot of buzz but once its out and people are use to it theyll wonder how they ever lived with out it especially the ability in the base os operating system to control removable media
4528200 a menudo tomo una decisi n consciente de no recordar el recuerdo ordinario me resulta peligroso me operaron cuando ten a ocho a os y tuve una reacci n muy mala a la anestesia tuve convulsiones tuvieron que sujetarme y envolverme en hielo la anestesia dio rienda suelta a la memoria y result insoportable siempre tuve claro d nde estaban las cosas peligrosas de la memoria siempre soy consciente de que no estoy recordando tengo la sensaci n de que si presiono demasiado o demasiado adentro en la memoria me romper no s lo me volver loco o algo as sino que me romper de verdad me perder a m mismo

4528202 but that is why you are in school nayana you will do fantastic things once you graduate you are a student students are poor and live on budgets and sludge through shcool so they can achieve higher things once they graduate
4528203 haha nayana what kind of a name is that anyways you so crazy you cant just decide youre going to make things work for you you cant just go around making crazy decisions like this and that
4528204 you can not sew you cannot operate a sewing machine youre crazy who will buy your dresses
4528205 we have built a precise system to maximize customer satisfaction
4528206 our years of experience and low rates give our clients peace of mind every time
4528207 nayana you prowl the stores like a shopping ninja wielding your wallet as if it were a samurai sword to slash helpess articles of clothing from their quivering shop racks
4528208 free time that is left over after all other priorities have been met
4528209 overall good effort but a lot of things weve got to get fixed
4528210 theres a lot of little mistakes when you throw them out here and all those guys have to be playing with complete complete precision being synchronized every snap of the ball for the most part the effort was excellent we just got a lot of execution things we need to clean up
4528211 thats what i talked to the team about after the scrimmage
4528212 were going to make some mistakes particularly this point in time during training camp what you cant do is repeat those mistakes youve got to get them fixed and we talked to the players about communication theyve got to be able to fix some of those things on the field themselves before we can get the off on the sidelines and the way they do that is talk with each other out there
4528213 i suspected something when i found the first bird in gabon since it didnt exactly match any of the species descriptions in the
4528214 once i was able to compare them side by side to other specimens in our collections it was clear that these birds were special
4528215 although finding an unknown species like the olive backed was not the goal of the project it is definitely a reminder that the world still holds surprises for us
4528216 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4528217 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4528218 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4528219 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4528220 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4528221 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4528222 this is a planning took where all things are going
4528223 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4528224 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4528225 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4528226 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4528227 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4528228 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4528229 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4528230 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4528231 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4528232 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4528233 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4528234 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4528235 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4528236 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4528237 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4528238 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4528239 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4528240 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4528241 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4528242 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4528243 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4528244 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4528245 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4528246 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4528247 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4528248 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4528249 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4528250 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4528251 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4528252 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4528253 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4528254 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4528255 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4528256 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4528257 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4528258 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4528259 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4528260 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4528261 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4528262 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4528263 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4528264 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4528265 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4528266 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4528267 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4528268 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4528269 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4528270 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4528271 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4528272 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4528273 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4528274 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4528275 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4528276 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4528277 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4528278 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4528279 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4528280 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4528281 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4528282 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4528283 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4528284 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4528285 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4528286 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4528287 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4528288 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4528289 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4528290 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4528291 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4528292 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4528293 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4528294 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4528295 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4528296 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4528297 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4528298 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4528299 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4528300 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4528301 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4528302 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4528303 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4528304 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4528305 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4528306 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4528307 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4528308 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4528309 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4528310 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4528311 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4528312 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4528313 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4528314 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4528315 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4528316 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4528317 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4528318 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4528319 sam tries to focus on lindsay but its never enough
4528320 lindsay has to be the center of attention or shell flirt with other guys to make sam jealous
4528321 be careful you could end up with the endlessly bitter and snippy colleen as a replacement
4528322 shop via their camera phones by scanning the qr code appearing in print advertisements store windows and mailers
4528323 the qr codes will link consumers directly to ralph laurens limited edition 2008 u s open collection as well as sell ralph lauren classics including polos oxfords and chinos
4528324 the law requires us to deliver to every single address but it doesnt protect our members from out of control dangerous and aggressive dogs
4528325 my dad used to sing a short sing song to me
4528326 if a group of indie kids pass a group of emos in town we wouldnt acknowledge them theyre just so whinny and irritating
4528327 i think thats why emo gets labelled whiny in heavy metal for example a lot of the themes revolve around crisis or struggle but also about overcoming that from strength you overcome adversity emo seems to be much more an expression of the struggle the actual depression itself
4528328 hannah was a happy 13 year old until she became an emo part of a sinister teenage craze that romanticises death three months later she hanged herself her devastated mother tells other parents no child is safe
4528329 its said that in any classroom theres probably two that are cutters and this is definitely something new in youth culture this whole fascination with the scarlet scream as some call it
4528330 they will slide through it and look back on it as a giggle
4528331 a world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams your misery and hate will kill us all so paint it black and take it back
4528332 i dont know what an adult emo would be like because ive never seen one
4528333 he had his house burnt the people are angry he was beating up neighbours and now he is left alone all the politicians that sent him are gone
4528334 a population pyramid looks increasingly heavy at the top end
4528335 what were seeing is the baby boomers who were born in the 1950s and early 60s coming through to the older ages and thats the big bulge in the older population coming through now
4528336 weve talked about how our cities are laid out in terms of our footpaths and things like that
4528337 were now dealing with a different looking population that may require different things widening footpaths for the trolleys and making it easier for people to cross the roads those sorts of things
4528338 theres a lot of focus on the burden but there is also a lot of opportunities
4528339 yes there will be more people retiring but a lot of those people will work for longer were certainly seeing higher labour force participation in the older ages hopefully thats people enjoying work longer
4528340 if a child cant learn the way we teach maybe we should teach the way they learn
4528341 make things easy and do not make them complicated be cheerful and do not be repulsive
4528342 those who have the privilege to know have the duty to act

4528350 start where the song gets good you only have 15 seconds
4528351 try to pick a song that the judges likely havent heard all day
4528352 maybe a good song that people might have forgotten about that can help you stand out
4528353 indeed not i feel that intelligent friends are usually much better for modeling they havent been spoiled by acquiring that models habit of mugging and grinning under all circumstances
4528354 an agent is invaluable to the beginner he has an entree to art directors that the beinning artist does not have and he can help greatly to build the young artists career the difficulty for the young artist is to enlist the services of a good representative for the best of them are beset by more artists than they can handle with integrity
4528355 the only way to engage the interest of a representative is of course to present him with a portfolio of work of promising caliber after being assured of the agents reputation and standing the young artist would be well advised to put his work entirely into the agents hands and to be guided by his advice this does not rule out the artists ambition to improve and change drawings of the kind of work he wants to do should be constantly added to what he has already done
4528356 only in this way do art directors see his latest output finding the right agent is an important step that should be discussed with art directors and other artists whose judgement may prove helpful
4528357 i am wary of accepting movie stills as the last word of authority after an incident which happened to me in hollywood during a visit to one of the larger studios i was talking to a woman who was in charge of all research i told her of the great value we illustrators place in movie stills as sources of historical reference we assumed i said that the research facilities of the movie industry were much greater than our own and we therefore relied heavily on this research for accuracy she replied that on the contrary if a picture had appeared in a magazine such as the saturday evening post that constituted authority enough for them i left her pondering uneasily on the extent to which the halt have been leading the blind these many years
4528358 the greatest danger in commercial illustration is repetition and the boredom and loss of interest that inevitably follow the history of illustrative art is full of examples of illustrators who on the strength of a big success turned into super mechanics only to be shocked and surprised when public enthusiasm gave way to apathy
4528359 this is even truer when the origianl success was a production of some distinction i know of no way better to avoid the stumbling block of repetition than to determine to wait for the particular solution to each problem rather than to repeat a recent successful idea
4528360 without him i dont think id be where i am today
4528361 without him i dont think id be where i am today
4528362 we have a new guitar player thats gonna play for the first time tomorrow its the first time well play onstage together his name is wes borland and he used to be in a really terrible band that he left because he felt that it was a destructive force in art and he has his own band black light burns but now he is in marilyn manson we dont know how permanent that is but starting tomorrow will be the first step
4528363 without him i dont think id be where i am today
4528364 the mentality of us at the moment is that we should be very hard to beat and pick a team accordingly
4528365 we have a problem when we havent got the ball at times we switch off collectively we probably put more pressure on our goalkeeper and back four than we should and thats something we have to sort out
4528366 we brought in experienced players that will help and we have a decent squad now we have options but i know my side for the burnley game i knew on tuesday night
4528367 ben will give us something extra in the dressing room and on the pitch he will help the youngsters as well the lads know him from the northern ireland trip and he was a great help out there he is probably a little short on match fitness but he will come straight into the squad for the burnley game
4528368 it probably shocked them last week going to sheffield and losing they will be looking to bounce back
4528369 paterson is someone who i would have probably gone in and tried to get but burnley beat us to the punch he was very lively here last season with scunthorpe and scored two goals he can be a real threat
4528370 burnley had a good win in the cup like us and im sure they will hope to come out of the blocks firing on all cylinders we have to withstand the early pressure be strong and get a result
4528371 its our first game at home and a chance for the fans to get behind us and hopefully we will reward them with three points
4528372 saturday gives us the opportunity to get up and running the fans were brilliant at bury this week singing their hearts out and the players respond to that well get more of that on saturday im sure and i want the players to go and reward the fans with three points
4528373 there is no doubt it will be a tough game because there are no easy games in the championship we have to be at our very best to win games and thats a collective effort from back to front we will look to do that on saturday and try to kick on from there
4528374 ipswich were very unfortunate to lose at home last saturday by all accounts they dominated the game and lost to a couple of wonder goals we know they are a very good side who have invested heavily in their squad
4528375 i have no doubts that come the end of the season ipswich will be up around the top six they have some very talented players and it has all the makings of a good game
4528376 thats the nature of the job and it is a nice dilemma to have

4528385 these events will undoubtedly pave the way for greater conflict and disintegration in georgia
4528386 nino burdzhanadze was giving her first televised national address following the resignation of eduard shevardnadze we have managed to overcome the gravest crisis in georgias recent history without shedding a single drop of blood ms burdzhanadze said
4528387 washington and moscow treat the small weak divided caucasian states as mere pawns in a game in which the whole region acts as a gigantic chessboard america makes a move russia responds and the result is a war an assassination an explosion a military coup or a bloodless revolution we are now awaiting the next move in the game we do not know when or where moscow will respond but one thing we do know the losers will be the ordinary people the poor the defenceless
4528388 the russians had changed dramatically along with the balance of power in the region they welcomed the opportunity to drive home the new reality which was that they could invade georgia and the united states and europe could not respond as for risk they did not view the invasion as risky militarily there was no counter economically russia is an energy exporter doing quite well indeed the europeans need russian energy even more than the russians need to sell it to them politically as we shall see the americans needed the russians more than the russians needed the americans moscows calculus was that this was the moment to strike the russians had been building up to it for months and they struck

4528391 lenin stood for the unity of the peoples of the former tsarist empire but it had to be a voluntary unity that is why he insisted from the very beginning on the right to self determination this idea which is frequently misinterpreted to mean a demand for separation is entirely incorrect the bolsheviks did not advocate separation but defended the broadest possible extension of national self determination up to and including separation no one has the right to oblige a people to live within the confines of a state when the majority do not wish to do so but the right to self determination no more implies the demand to separate than the right to divorce means the demand that all couples must separate or that the right to abortion means that all pregnancies must be terminated
4528392 the right of self determination was an important part of lenins programme insofar as it demonstrated clearly to the oppressed workers and peasants especially the latter of poland georgia latvia and the ukraine that the russian workers had no interest in oppressing them and would firmly defend their right to determine their own destiny but this was only half of lenins programme on the national question the other half was equally as important the need to uphold the union of the proletariat above all national linguistic or religious differences as far as the bolshevik party was concerned lenin always opposed any tendency to divide the party and the workers movement in general along national lines
4528393 i declare war to the death of great russian chauvinism
4528394 after the revolution lenin hoped that there could be a voluntary and fraternal union of the peoples of the former tsarist empire in the form of a soviet federation to this end he demanded that the nationalities be treated with extreme sensitivity every manifestation of great russian chauvinism was to be rooted out as a matter of fact for some time after october the word russia disappeared altogether from official documents the official name of the homeland of october was simply the workers state

4528401 the john mccain who ran in 2000 would have a hard time voting for the john mccain we see today
4528402 i cooperated fully and completely with the senate indian affairs committees investigation and was never implicated in wrongdoing or accused of doing anything improper
4528403 i hold no official role or position in the mccain campaign and am not seeking one i simply sent out an email containing pro forma language used by anyone asking others to support senator mccain the attacks by the obama campaign are absurd

4528406 my fellow citizens let no one doubt that this is a difficult and dangerous effort on which we have set out no one can foresee precisely what course it will take or what costs or casualties will be incurred many months of sacrifice and self discipline lie ahead months in which both our patience and our will be tested months in which many threats and denunciations will keep us aware of our dangers but the greatest danger of all would be to do nothing the path we have chosen for the present is full of hazards as all paths are but it is the one most consistent with our character and courage as a nation and our commitments around the world the cost of freedom is always high but americans have always paid it and one path we shall never choose and that is the path of surrender or submission our goal is not the victory of might but the vindication of right not peace at the expense of freedom but both peace and free mike d on aug 15 2008 11 34 am continued our goal is not the victory of might but the vindication of right not peace at the expense of freedom but both peace and freedom here in this hemisphere and we hope around the world god willing that goal will be achieved

4528434 steven davis is a player we have been interested in and hopefully we can do something there but we just have to wait and see
4528435 since the end of last season we have been trying hard to bring in some players who we feel will improve positions which need improved so it has been an ongoing thing
4528436 its always a slow process in the sense that most clubs wait until nearer the end of the transfer deadline
4528437 weve been in negotiations with a number of clubs and lost out on a number of players so we continue to try to get players in who we think will improve us
4528438 weve got one or two signings we would like to make before the deadline so hopefully we have a couple more before we are finished
4528439 if i wanted somebody far better than mac mcmanus and gary caldwell id have to pay 15 to 20 million

4528481 there are estimated to be thousands of members in the bia family and having a source for obtaining large quantities of specific bia molecules is critical to gaining access to the diverse functional activities provided by these molecules
4528482 but even the intermediate molecules that we are producing can exhibit important and valuable activities and a related area of research will be to examine more closely the pharmacological activities of these metabolites and derivatives now that pure sources can be obtained
4528483 if one thinks of these molecules as encoding functions that are of interest to us the ability to produce nonnatural alkaloids will provide access to more diverse functions and activities by expanding to nonnatural alkaloids we can search for molecules that provide enhanced activities new activities and not be limited by the activities that have been selected for in nature
4528484 our work has the potential to result in new therapeutic drugs for a broad range of diseases this work also provides an exciting example of the increased complexity with which we are engineering biological systems to address global societal challenges
4528485 the soaring prices of oil on the global level during these last six years have reminded us of the importance of safeguarding energy security in our homeland
4528486 were raising the energy supply capacity through accelerated energy diversification the utilisation of non fuel oil alternative energy including new and renewable energy such as micro hydro geothermal and biofuel
4528487 in addition to tapping renewable energies we must effectively save energy thus far we have been a nation that splurges on the use of energy
4528488 the whole of society is expected to save whether in private offices or in households
4528489 this is a very significant amount as we can make use of it for the development of our education health infrastructure and even defence

4528491 we were surprised by the severity of the residual sleep apnea in postoperative patients
4528492 the majority of individuals still had moderate to severe osa
4528493 the second surprising finding of this study was that despite the persistence and severity of the disease most people thought their sleep apnea was resolved after their weight loss and only a few still used cpap
4528494 imaging and measurement resolutions as well as atomic structural ambiguities defects obscured the results of most experiments and provided unreliable mechanical predictions
4528495 we can be certain of all the quantities we have measured and the results match quantum mechanics predictions very well
4528496 irradiating a multiwalled carbon nanotube with an intense electron beam actually forms bonds among the shells of the tube this is like combining multiple nanotubes into one to form a stronger structure
4528497 the same procedure used to strengthen individual multiwalled nanotubes by irradiation may also be used to link together individual nanotubes into a bundle
4528498 i want to get a little fresh air and exercise and cut my carbon footprint and spend less money on gas and where i live i can ride my bike seven months out of the year
4528499 if youve got a date you go to meet friends you go out on a conventional bike youre gonna sweat up you go out in an electric bike its great its terrific youre not gonna sweat up and you ride home fine
4528500 fifty percent of that increase is probably because of gas prices and the rest is that theres just more bikes out there
4528501 when i started there was only one bike that had a nickel metal hydride battery everything else was lead acid and was 80 or 90 pounds
4528502 the new designs that weve seen in the marketplace are going to inure to the benefit of the electric bike companies
4528503 a year ago when you mentioned the word electric bike people looked at you and they really werent sure what it was
4528504 today what were finding is were actually having dealers call us seeking an electric bike to meet the demand
4528505 did you know there are 70 million electric bikes on the road today in china and they are selling at the rate of 2 6 million electric bikes a year
4528506 the public at large needs to understand that it is the right thing to do to move to electric transportation and electric bikes and electric scooters will allow you to do that to get that familiarity

4528512 historically apple does not respond to something like this automatically just because there are reports of problems if there is merit to the issue they work overtime to fix it and usually at the point of the fix that is when they respond
4528513 apple prides itself on its customer service reputation and i would be surprised if they dont go the extra mile to make sure anything that impacts that image will be corrected as fast as possible
4528514 apple has had the same problem in every market where the 3g iphone is sold
4528515 measuring stress and strain may rescue some patients condemned to very low tidal volume or positive end expiratory pressure if physicians only looked at airway plateau pressure
4528516 therefore low or high tidal volume such as 6 and 12 ml kg respectively
4528517 could produce similar stress and strain in a remarkable fraction of patients in each subgroup

4528540 unlike other voip programs this application doesnt require any software installation

4528542 the purpose of this upgrade is to provide our customers with peace of mind in knowing that their investment in rfid technology has longevity and a better price value option for library system customers
4528543 the memory capacity is large enough for future applications and users are provided with another tag option to meet their price needs these are very high value advantages for a basic tag option
4528544 this new basic tag option fits into a complete line of rfid tags premium and enhanced that 3m provides to libraries it is part of a complete portfolio of rfid tags that gives the library a choice of tag options that will best fit its needs
4528545 is another big step forward in helping libraries adopt the productivity enhancing benefits of rfid libraries face mounting pressures today to provide more services to growing populations without substantial increases in human or financial resources rfid technology is a staff and customer friendly cost efficient means of filling the gap
4528546 even after rfid conversion libraries want to retain barcodes to have a visible number on their collection items for various uses and a logo to identify items that are loaned to other branches and libraries the 3m print conversion system handles all of that in one step plus weeding its one of the most efficient conversion systems available and eliminates the cost of buying barcodes for future additions to the library collection
4528547 we want libraries to have the freedom to make changes as easily and cost effectively as possible especially because an iso standardized format may be issued in the not too distant future
4528548 the 3m print conversion system is another important step forward for the productivity gains that rfid is bringing to libraries around the world
4528549 as the demand for library services increases at a time when budgets are static at best we are making this technology easy to use so that every library staff member can perform his or her tasks with greater efficiency and job satisfaction

4528569 had the authors confined themselves to announcing their scientific results it would have been an interesting paper

4528573 i had heard nothing but good things about norseman and i was looking for a break from racing fast on the ironman m dot circuit norseman offered the perfect solution a race that would be an adventure and one i would need to treat with even more respect than a conventional ironman so i signed up for norseman 2008 and i was not disappointed not only is the course very difficult over 3000m of climb on the bike and 1800m in the last 17km of the run but the weather conditions change the race from year to year so you can never know exactly what you will face come race day however the fear this instilled in me made me commit to training like never before and this resulted in me having a very good day norseman is a point to point race that takes you on a spectacular journey through dramatic norwegian countryside every competitor needs their own support team and car and with weather conditions constantly changing the car needs to be full of numerous race wear options and plenty of nutrition one of the best aspects of norseman is this support crew requirement the norseman team makes it very clear at the briefing that the support crews are as important as the athletes and you soon appreciate this once you start racing my support crew was faultless and proved that organisational and motivational skills are more important than knowledge of the intricacies of triathlon racing the race begins in the dark at 3 45am when you board a car ferry along with 200 other wetsuit clad athletes this is the most surreal part of the day as you wave farewell to your support crew and settle into the bowels of the ferry for the hour long ride straight up the centre of the fjord just as it seems to be getting a little lighter you are called to the top deck and given a 10 minute warning to the start for me this was the most frightening part of the day it wasnt the 4 metre jump from the back of the car ramp that i was dreading but the temperature of the water but with five minutes to go i jumped in and was pleasantly surprised the water was beautiful 17 degrees this year and comfortable with a wetsuit and neoprene hat the ferry horn sent us on our way and soon i was swimming with clear water in front and only two others in sight we had been warned the current was against us this year so i headed for the shore and stayed close the whole way the swim is the best experience i have had in any triathlon race the water is dark but clear slightly salty and every time you breathe you catch sight of mist hovering over the water and steep mountain sides plunging down to the side of the fjord there are no buoys or markers you just swim in a straight line up the fjord towards the twinkling lights of eidfjord before making a left hand turn around a rowing boat that takes a bit of finding i exited the water 9th overall and 1st woman by around 20 minutes i knew i had had a great swim although due to the current my time was over 20 minutes slower than expected at 1 hour 18 minutes this was my sort of race with tough swimming conditions the swim seemed to mean something more than the usual warm up for the bike and run the bike course allows you a few kilometres to warm up before you head on to an old tourist road for the first 25km climb at 8 that will bring you out at the 40km mark this was my first support crew stop and i needed to layer up with a winter jacket and knee warmers from here the course takes you across the stunning hardanger plateau before you descend into geilo to hit the halfway point on the bike this stretch really cost me time it should be fast and we were lucky this year with a slight tailwind but there was driving rain for most of the way and i was getting desperately cold as i had feared it was the weather conditions that threatened my race rather than the extreme course over this section i watched the support car for number 21 coming up past me and stopping for a time check i knew this was the support car for the second woman on the road after 70km i stopped seeing them and i assumed this meant i had stretched my lead now i know they no longer needed to pass me because she was eating massive chunks out of my lead from geilo it all started to look better the sun came out and we headed on to three climbs in quick succession all between 3 5km long and 7 9 normally i am in my element on the hills but although i was able to ride strong i could no longer feel my feet or hands at the top of the middle climb i sat down at the side of the road while my selfless support crew massaged my feet and changed my socks and toe warmers although this made me feel better it was not a good sight to see number 21 heidi harviken fly over the top of the hill at high speed in full aero set up back on my bike and a little warmer i knew i couldnt match her speed on the flats or descents so i settled into riding well on the hills and trying not to lose too much time on the descents at 135km you start the last climb imingfell this stretches on for nearly 10km at 9 this climb is a classic and switches back on itself just like any good climb should i was starting to warm up now and climbed well to come back to within three minutes of heidi the top of the climb levels out across a beautiful plateau for 10km with plenty of wild flowers houses with roofs covered in grass and mountain lakes spirits rise along this part of the course as all you have left is a 30km descent into t2 but i rode badly for the last 30km i was more tired than i realised and when i hit the flatter final 10km i realised the cold had taken a real toll on me and i had very little left to give on the bike i rolled into t2 over eight mins down on heidi and very glad to see the back of my bike i knew i needed to regroup in t2 to get my race back on track but my longer than usual transition meant i went out onto the run over 15 mins down the run was beautiful and as the route quietly undulated around the side of a lake i quickly got into my running stride time checks were being made by the number 21 support crew but they were also being made by my main support man johnny and we knew we were catching her the run is mainly flat for 25km before you hit zombie hill and gaustatoppen mountain for the last 17 2km with heidi coming into sight i decided to run hard on the flat to try and put as much time as i could between us before the mountain where i had no idea how i would fare at 14km i passed her and willed myself to keep the pace up later the race organiser haarek would tell me that he thinks the smart way to race is to do exactly the opposite although on this day i dont think i would have won if heidi had me in her sights on the mountain at 18km you see the gaustatoppen mountain in front of you and you realise that 1880m is a very high race finish the stretch from 18km to 25km passed without event and i just focused on hanging in to the start of zombie hill funnily enough i felt like the race was over at zombie hill and all i had to do was walk my way up 7km of switchbacks and then the mountain this allowed me a lot of time to eat drink and reflect back on the amazing journey so far with my support crew we were all in great spirits and i was getting messages that my boyfriend richard was also having a dream race and even running parts of the hill the support from other crews and the norseman team on this hill was phenomenal and i soon found myself at the 32km mark and being directed towards a mountain top finish from 32km to 37km the road really levels out and on any normal day you wouldnt question running this road this is the one part of my performance i really regret i walked this section i walked it fast but i walked and i really wish i had run at 37km i put my backpack on and jonny and i headed off the road and on to the mountain i have never had any natural talent for walking or mountain climbing so i knew i wouldnt be making any time on this section i was content to walk my way up and savour one of the best views you will ever see people were applauding me as the first woman on the mountain but i suddenly realised that i had no idea how close heidi was a quarter of the way up the mountain we were greeted by another member of my support crew toby and i asked him to wait there and see how much time i had on heidi after too short a time the call came through to jonny that she was not far behind i really had relaxed too much so i had to leave jonny to struggle up the mountain with his very heavy backpack full of celebratory beers and make haste to the top halfway up i realised most of my food was also in his backpack and i deliriously asked a stranger for some sugar the chocolate produced gave me the final energy i needed to reach the mountain top i got to relax over the last 10 minutes when i could see that i was going to be the first woman at the top of gaustatoppen crossing the finish line after just over 14 hours was pure elation to win was a dream and it was even more special at 1880m tomato soup has never tasted so good and sharing it with richard the first non norwegian at the top and our support crew of jonny toby and piers was priceless as was the two hours it took us all to walk down from the mountain the prize for reaching the mountain top is a black finishers t shirt those who dont make the top complete the distance on a lower road and receive a white t shirt all the t shirts are presented the following morning and there are no special prizes for the winners because at norseman all finishers are winners the sheer enormity and challenge of the norseman race is what made me train and race smart and it is a race i will never forget finally i have found a race sticker that i am proud to stick to my bike box if you are looking for a race that is run across spectacular scenery and by a race crew that organise the race for the right reason a love of the sport then you must do norseman
4528574 even though the ncaa bids were accomplished over the course of four years i think each of those three seasons we had completely different teams
4528575 i think the sign of a good program is that even as players graduate the team is able to maintain its high standards we have an expectation of success and that combined with high standards has allowed us to grow in spite of huge turnover of players to graduation
4528576 more so than replacing dave on the field replacing his personality and energy will be the challenge
4528577 as great of a player as dave was he brought great enthusiasm to every training session and his ability to involve his teammates in the game added to that energy we will be a different team without dave and his teammates understand that they have to step up and fill the void no one player will fill the void but it will be a shared effort with picking up the leadership roles
4528578 defensively becomes one of the few fifth year seniors we have had here having deferred medical school for a year has established himself as one of the top left backs in the country and will hopefully continue their improvement misha really had a breakthrough year last year and look forward to having him between the pipes for a full year with a veteran crew of the players mentioned we again hope to be among the big tens best defenses
4528579 obviously making the ncaa tournament and giving yourself a chance to win a national championship has been and will continue to be our preeminent goal
4528580 one way to guarantee yourself that opportunity is to win the big ten tournament as much success as weve had in the past one goal that has eluded this program has been to win a big ten championship with a veteran group this year of six seniors it would be a great way to cap off their careers with the schools first ever big ten championship success ultimately comes down to scoring goals and not giving up many we want to continue to be among the league leaders in both categories if we are going to make our goals become reality

4528586 at this time we would like to declare an emergency and also have cfr crash equipment standing by in st louis
4528587 information we get in real time is preliminary and may be subject to change when we get a fuller account of what happened
4528588 we didnt have any real reason to go back and question what we were told initially nobody called us to question that
4528589 there are many situations in which a pilot declares an emergency and in the vast majority of cases the pilot lands the plane safely
4528590 declaring an emergency gives that aircraft priority and ensures there is rescue equipment available in case there is a real problem
4528591 i just thought wed spice things up a little bit today

4528596 he spent 30 minutes telling me peter couldnt win he had more show of winning than peter
4528597 i found none of it compelling i spent 30 minutes putting my case and he spent 30 minutes responding
4528598 if my senior colleagues were as a group prepared to own a request for me to go id have gone
4528599 but i was not going to out of the blue go because i didnt think that would have produced a different result and that i would have rightly been criticised for cowardice

4528602 ive gotten a lot of questions the last few weeks asking if obama is the antichrist
4528603 i tell everyone that i dont think the antichrist will come out of politics especially american politics
4528604 i can see by the language he uses why people think he could be the antichrist
4528605 but from my reading of scripture he doesnt meet the criteria there is no indication in the bible that the antichrist will be an american

4528644 the milestone gives investors a chance to pause and reflect on two companies that have generated the lions share of media coverage and consumer and investor attention some might be surprised that apple has ascended to the top spot but look at the companies a little deeper and it strikes me as odd that it took this long to happen

4528674 john mccain has been endorsed by more retired admirals and generals than barack obama has military donors
4528675 we feel confident that many u s troops stationed overseas will support john mccain in the election this fall but we suspect most are too busy doing the important work of defending this country than to make political contributions

4528695 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4528696 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4528729 mccains trying to position himself as a green candidate but yet he had a score of zero from the league of conservation voters last year
4528730 thats the worst record for the senate for environmental issues from commercials you get the feeling that hes environmentally friendly
4528731 theres a problem and its not being addressed and we have three months until the election
4528732 mccain hes just doing the republican thing being misleading because he wants to be in power
4528733 the iraqi people want a timetable the majority of americans favor a timetable why dont our leaders favor timetables as well
4528734 thousands of other republicans are going to be picking country over party in this election
4528735 my goal is to let republicans have a clear understanding that their right to vote should not be restricted by party affiliation
4528736 one candidate john mccain who has always put country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not
4528737 i have a record of reaching across the aisle reaching across the aisle and working with my friends whether it be joe lieberman or ted kennedy
4528738 it was almost like they were welcoming o j simpson to orange county i was outraged to hear that
4528739 the least i could do is show myself over here to say that people do care about our constitution and our laws
4528740 we want to make sure that calvert supporters are not welcome and the san clemente beaches are not for sale
4528741 my personal feeling is that this is not a good thing for calvert
4528742 certainly very popular with the people that were here tonight
4528743 i have known the vice president for a long time and hes a friend of mine and i appreciated him coming to do this
4528744 look i think the president has kept us safe the last eight years and national security is an important issue as we move to the next president the people in the country will realize that national security is an important issue and thats the reason john mccain will be elected president of the united states
4528745 look the president and the vice president have always polled strongly within the party and calvert is one of those who has been a supporter of the administration and pursuing policies that the good for orange county and his constituents
4528746 they are continuing to pursue policies that they believe are correct regardless of popularity
4528747 we had eight years of a president whose first meeting every day was with a pollster clinton was driven by the polls everything he did was couched by how itd affect him in the polls
4528748 it is a natural result of what is going on in iraq under this u s occupation that so many iraqi students failed the high school exams
4528749 how can a student pass such difficult exams feeling terrified exhausted in the heat in darkness without electricity having to work in the absence of a dead or detained father and all the problems of the world over his head
4528750 i am ashamed of the results my school achieved this year

4528758 i decided to stop fooling myself by dreaming of going to college and becoming a lawyer
4528759 one has to face reality that iraq is finished as a country
4528760 the americans and their collaborators need us as dirty policemen and garbage collectors who locate roadside bombs for them
4528761 we must realise that college has become a luxury that we cannot afford

4528779 i lost my second baseman when the pitcher threw the ball at his head and i dont see any place for that in baseball
4528780 i respect the way cuba plays baseball but i dont like losing players or how that game ended lazo is a good pitcher but he hit him in the eye no game of baseball is worth that
4528781 that is a lack of respect on the part of the u s manager to say that
4528782 the cuban team is very professional we respect the game and our opponents we are incapable of doing that
4528783 im not the type of pitcher to do that because its not the correct way to play the game i did not hit him intentionally it was an accident the ball hit the bat first and bounced onto his face thats unfortunate but i was just pitching to get him out
4528784 we came back to show that we are the strong team we said we were
4528785 it was a good place to be mentally to think that i had a chance

4528792 our international business ties and our joint projects have turned gazprom into a global company we will rigorously abide by all of our long term contract obligations the size of our reserves permits us to confidently state that gazprom is able to meet any solvent consumers demand for gas in domestic and foreign markets alike
4528793 the main task of the forum in contrast to opec isnt the setting of daily production quotas but questions of long term strategy and investment plans in the gas industry
4528794 washington map news the violent assault on berwyn heights mayor cheye calvos home late last month was certainly not the first bungled raid by a government swat team but the bad publicity it generated should make it the last time these trigger happy squads target innocent civilians
4528795 defusing dangerous situations like riots hostage takings or bank robberies
4528796 i n january 2006 police in fairfax used a swat team to serve a search warrant on salvatore culosi jr whom they suspected of gambling on sporting events when the swat team confronted culosi as he came out of his home one officers gun discharged striking culosi in the chest and killing him police concede that culosi had no weapon and made no menacing gestures as police prepared to arrest him
4528797 the problem is these violent highly confrontational swat raids are conducted based on information first gleaned from informants which means the information isnt always accurate which means an untold number of innocent americans have been subjected to the horrifying predicament of having armed men invade their homes in the middle of the night and needing to decide immediately upon waking if the intruders are cops or criminals and if they should submit or resist map it plots nearly 300 botched swat raids ive found over the course of about a year of research it is by no means comprehensive my guess is that it doesnt even begin to make a full accounting for how many times this has happened both because police are reluctant to report their mistakes and because the victims of botched raids are often too afraid or embarrassed to come forward increasingly these raids are moving beyond the drug war swat teams are now being employed to serve white collar warrants too sad as it is perhaps thats what it will take perhaps once upper class people with more power and social leverage begin to feel the brunt force of this blunt law enforcement tool well begin to see some change
4528798 l a police chief darryl gates invented the swat concept in the 1960s shortly after the watts riots gates wanted an elite team of police who could defuse dangerous situations like riots hostage takings or bank robberies for about a decade thats how swat teams were used and they performed marvelously
4528799 police say that one suspects concealed carry permit indicated he was potentially dangerous which necessitated the involvement of the swat team

4528833 this ad is just more of the same old false and discredited attacks that senator mccain knows arent true
4528834 and despite his rhetoric hes refusing to support the bipartisan senate proposal to expand production and invest in renewable energy because he wants to protect tax breaks for oil companies weve seen what happens when we put the oil companies and their lobbyists ahead of working families and thats exactly what americans want to change in this election
4528835 mccain is offering nothing more than a 3rd bush term
4528836 this is more of the same lies from john mccain that have been discredited but he continues to repeat them perhaps he think the press wont call him out on his repeated lies

4528870 our additional concern with lethal injection is that unskilled people should not attempt it
4528871 this is acceptable to us provided ebb is willing to pay tracs a stipend for every rabbit turned over to our group we feel that it is not right for the company to pocket 54 k for the year for capturing the rabbits when in fact we would pay for sterilization pen building and maintenance
4528872 we are willing to negotiate with ebb and hopefully they will offer to pay for the service of caring for the caught rabbits these are rabbits that ebb will not have to deal with
4528873 certainly in the process of all the re zoning that council was undertaking we were trying to be mindful of what the intent of the original covenant upheld the covenant which sets out three distinct parts the land must never be sold must be used for municipal purposes and must not to be used for commercial or industrial purposes
4528874 the goal of this and previous councils is to preserve continuous public access to okanagan lake from city park to knox mountain park
4528875 you can put municipal buildings on it but you cant put commercial or industrial buildings on the land when we tried to remove the covenant the save the simpson society covenant tried to put a stop to it and thats why it ended up in the courts it has implications for future changes in zoning and use of the land if this ruling overrides the caveat that no commercial activity is allowed on the property than what implications will this have for stuart park for instance an example would be could a hotdog vendor for example not set up shop in that park
4528876 the first one is live trapping followed by providing the live animals to rabbit rescue groups or to wildlife shelters the second one is live trapping followed by lethal injection which is akin to putting an animal down in a veterinary facility the third one is the use of an air rifle and the euthanized animals would be provided to wildlife shelters food its a high powered air rifle that i guess is similar to a regular one except for the fact it doesnt make the same noise
4528877 we agree with some of the groups that we would like to try to preserve as many of the animals as we can but we feel there are too many to rescue them all and have them spayed or neutered we understand that tracs has rescued up to 250 animals which is great
4528878 thats a major concern because they can cause major damage in the agricultural community thats already happened at one farm where theyve attacked the young apple trees

4528892 you cant now start moving the goal post after the goal has been scored
4528893 you are trying to make a fool of yourself before the international community and the world at large
4528894 there is something else i want to tell you people when the dispute was brokered there were intrigues as to what actually happened under gowon etcetera etcetera and in the process i discovered that the ministry of lands and surveys was in custody of a map during the regime of olusegun obasanjo as military head of state
4528895 the map contained water basins mountains obdulation and so on and each page was signed with green pen by the head of state and this is olusegun obasanjo and i looked at every page and that map gave bakassi to cameroun
4528896 in other words if the international court of justice used that map alone in making their decision the court would have been justified after all they say it was gowon who gave it away fine undoubtedly may be theres another map signed by gowon i have no idea but i am talking about the map which existed in the then ministry of land and survey
4528897 i mentioned this protest against taking bakassi case to icj in the press only to be attacked by akinjide because his likes were the people wanting the case to go on because of their personal gain
4528898 i mean i was attacked by akinjide who was enjoying fat retainer in international justice and as a result wanted the case to go on

4528925 i suspected something when i found the first bird in gabon since it didnt exactly match any of the species descriptions in the
4528926 once i was able to compare them side by side to other specimens in our collections it was clear that these birds were special
4528927 although finding an unknown species like the olive backed was not the goal of the project it is definitely a reminder that the world still holds surprises for us
4528928 theres been quite substantial snowfall in the last 36 hours
4528929 avalanche conditions have deteriorated in the duration of their trip thats not uncommon
4528930 the snow is known to be very unstable and the boom of the blades is enough to set an avalanche off
4528931 they will be going down to get a closer detail on what efforts are being made and whats going on without interfering with the rescue effort obviously
4528932 its going to be cold but if youve gone and prepared for more than one day then theres every chance of doing well in these situations
4528933 its having the confidence to sometimes do nothing just build a cave and get in it and wait rather than stumbling around out in the storm

4528957 a population pyramid looks increasingly heavy at the top end
4528958 what were seeing is the baby boomers who were born in the 1950s and early 60s coming through to the older ages and thats the big bulge in the older population coming through now
4528959 weve talked about how our cities are laid out in terms of our footpaths and things like that
4528960 were now dealing with a different looking population that may require different things widening footpaths for the trolleys and making it easier for people to cross the roads those sorts of things
4528961 theres a lot of focus on the burden but there is also a lot of opportunities
4528962 yes there will be more people retiring but a lot of those people will work for longer were certainly seeing higher labour force participation in the older ages hopefully thats people enjoying work longer
4528963 for both of us its been public humiliation it hurts a big deal

4528965 i dont have an anger problem im a very rational person im the female im the victim i just think they got the wrong person
4528966 she said i punched her but there was no assault at all
4528967 for an elected councillor to find myself in the predicament im in i know that my colleagues are hurting
4528968 i think now it would be doing a disservice to the people who elected me to resign
4528969 we all make mistakes and learn by them i dont condone violence but if it happens again ill crack him
4528970 it will be especially attractive for young people because it is so accessible to them
4528971 they already text on a day to day basis and it is one of the main ways they communicate
4528972 it also requires less from them in terms of travel and talking to people and it is less invasive
4528973 the fact that it is one step removed may also appeal as some people are uncomfortable with face to face contact meeting a counsellor or ringing up and having to talk to someone
4528974 maori women started smoking with the men in the 1700s so maori have been smoking for a very long time
4528975 we need them to stop smoking early on so they are not addicted before they get pregnant
4528976 it is shocking that the maori smoking rate among women and pregnant women is so bad we need to do more
4528977 we have come from a different background and this is a mandate the people have given to us to lead the country to peace

4528979 the european market especially germany spain and italy is the center of pv demand from 2006 to 2007 the european pv industrys capacity grew over 43 and is expected to continue this growth into the foreseeable future the need to expand spires reach into this critical marketplace is crucial
4528980 our spi sun simulators are truly leading edge this year alone they were chosen by the most technically demanding users such as the national renewable energy laboratory located in the united states and underwriters laboratories located in the both the united states and china spires spi sun simulators are used by crystalline silicon module manufacturers worldwide as well as leading thin film producers such as first solar
4528981 once there were some children who liked to tell each other funny things
4528982 i wanted to make an affordable coffin which used as few resources as possible using minimal materials makes the coffin extraordinarily lightweight celebrants and funeral directors have been telling me it will give friends and family more choices in who carries their deceased loved one
4528983 its a completely different style of coffin its quite modern looking an eco coffin is generally coffin shaped a bit rustic looking and made out of pine
4528984 we have a funeral at the moment we are using one for we have had three or four used so far
4528985 i guess our only question is how eco is ply i suppose
4528986 but the interesting thing is its not really an economy option because most of them are made of solid timber they tend to cost a bit more than your average casket
4528987 this didnt reflect his values or his passions during life
4528988 thank the lord for his protection we made some memories
4528989 i really liked the idea of sharing the good and hard parts of the process in the same way that two people would approach an art project installation or show this is a book that is trying to convey not only the back and forth relationship between ruby and esme but also between the two friends that made the book
4528990 i was actually caught quite off guard by the almost entirely positive energy generated by getting so many other people in on the infancy of my process
4528991 even though the support and enthusiasm was so fantastic it led to some good old fashioned need to please anxiety that was causing me to constrict around the project a bit so i shared this on the blog was able to articulate it and then move it on through blog therapy you might call it
4528992 email seems to me like a conversation at a cerebral level where co creation seems more like a conversation at an energetic level
4528993 its like a long distance friendship has a special purpose because you have to go the extra mile to keep it strong and that can be dreamy and fantastic if you can create the habit of inspiring new ways to stay connected
4528994 hade de f tt ett annat lag hade de varit i semi
4528995 i have faith in the universe to provide me with all that i need my dreams are easily realized and my plans are easily completed support comes easily and naturally to me i am successful in all ventures and i share fully in the rewards i reap i am an agent of change i am fearless

4529010 nepali people have given us a great responsibility we will do a miracle in this country by doing economic revolution

4529028 once there were some children who liked to tell each other funny things
4529029 the jurys use of the bible here amounts to a type of private communication contact or tampering that is outside the evidence and law
4529030 as oliver has not presented clear and convincing evidence to rebut the state courts finding that the bible did not influence the jurys decision we cannot say that the jurys use of the bible had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jurys verdict
4529031 but if he struck him down with an iron object so that he died he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to death
4529032 you could say god and moses anticipated this exact thing if you take a literal view of it
4529033 there is contradictory evidence regarding whether the jurors consultation of the bible occurred before or after the jury reached its decision
4529034 several jurors testified that the bible was not a focus of their discussions
4529035 the time is ripe to make our chairmen accountable for the allocations made to them every month
4529036 the initiative when put in place soonest would not only make it difficult for local government chairmen to misappropriate funds but would ensure the funds allocated to their councils were channelled towards improving the welfare of the people
4529037 chocolate and cacao are outright health hazards due to the chemicals contaminants and additives they contain the chemicals within chocolate are called methylxanthines they can be further classified as theobromine caffeine and theophylline all of which have deleterious effects on the body theobromine is known to cause a host of symptoms including abnormal glandular growth nervousness depression anxiety insomnia gastrointestinal problems and itching caffeine is highly suspected of being a carcinogen and is directly linked to heart and circulatory problems glandular difficulties nervous disorders osteoporosis birthing abnormalities and so forth theophylline causes stomach problems nausea vomiting and nervous disorders the processing of cacao beans into powder and chocolate is an unsanitary risky procedure to say the least to be blunt chocolate and cacao are laced with animal feces and hair insects and molds the carcinogenic mold called aflatoxin has been found in large quantities on cacao beans allowable limits have been set by the fda regarding rodent feces and insect parts in chocolate and cocoa as quoted from poison with a capital c every time you eat a chocolate bar it may contain a rodent hair and 16 insect parts and still carry the blessing of the fda and for chocolate powder or cakes there must not be more than 75 insect fragments in three tablespoons of powder and four percent of cacao beans may be infested by insects animal excreta such as visible rat droppings must not exceed 10 milligrams per pound
4529038 first there is no raw chocolate being sold anywhere in order to taste like chocolate cacao beans must be heated i have lived in the tropics and have tried to bring out the chocolate taste in other ways it simply cannot be done there is no such thing as raw chocolate even the chocolate that is fermented so said to be raw is eventually heated and high enough to be cooked i am sure you know that heating the proteins in chocolate denatures them and causes them to become carcinogenic i assume you are aware that heating the carbohydrates caramelizes them adversely affecting their gi rating and also creating carcinogens it made worldwide headlines three years ago that heating fats even the fats in chocolate results in the production of carcinogens so that is no news to you i am sure it also results in the production of enzyme resistant protein bonds that are a causative agent in conditions ranging from arthritis to allergies leaky gut and many others the double bonds of the fats in chocolate become triple bonds under the influence of heat making them physiologically nonviable for humans and adversely impacting upon our cholesterol levels as far as the components of chocolate essentially it is a cocktail of toxic chemicals and drugs cacao beans contain methylxanthines such as the stimulant drugs known as caffeine theobromine and theophyllin all of which are known to produce permanent degenerative alterations in cellular protoplasm more tannin than tea oxalic acid cannabinoids aflatoxins so chocolate is not raw is defintely not health food and cannot be considered a superfood there is nothing about marketing chocolate that can be considered a positive except for the possible bottom line profits that it may offer
4529039 how do they feel what do you like about these what dont you like
4529040 what we need to consider as responsible adults is that things that occur in pop culture movies television and books are things that people do use in some sort of laymans way to educate themselves or to learn from or emulate in their own lives
4529041 these things are repeated by young people and adults alike
4529042 its dangerous for me to go there especially when theres a sale because i end up spending too much money

4529047 there are a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4529048 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4529049 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4529050 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4529051 these unsubstantiated spate of reports are totally baseless and malicious
4529052 once they issue impeachment proceedings against him and issue a charge sheet then it will become almost inevitable that he will want to answer those charges
4529053 he feels very strongly that a lot of that is being said is not correct
4529054 we have conveyed to them that the coalition is determined for impeachment and if he wants to save himself the best way is for him to quit
4529055 if a person moves to the side we are not in the habit of bothering him this would not be a good attitude if someone is lying on the ground and we go aggressively against him

4529061 homare sawa scored in the first half and yuki nagasato added a late goal before almost 29 000 noisy and mostly pro china fans at the qinhuangdao olympic center stadium
4529062 one of the most impressive players of the tournament sawa headed home a corner from aya miyama in the 15th minute and nagasato pounced on a loose ball in the box in the 80th and slotted a left footed shot
4529063 all year this team has been great at dealing with pressure either being down a goal or tied or having a team come back
4529064 weve always fought for 90 100 whatever it takes i like the fact that we are creating chances and having different people score goals
4529065 the main reason for our victory was that our defenders played pretty well against their forwards
4529066 our aim was to not give them too much space in front of the goal and win second balls and we did that pretty well
4529067 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal under the leadership of prachanda the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
4529068 i would like to congratulate the maoists for entering multi party competitive politics
4529069 we will stay in opposition and keep an eye on the maoists activities while they run the government we will oppose their actions if their activities incline towards autocracy
4529070 the integration of peoples liberation army into the nepal army will see lots of arguments and counter arguments the way they deal with the army is very crucial
4529071 the maoists will try to bring in populist and radical economic reforms but financially they will have lots of constraints

4529076 this idea of being covered in the dust of your rabbi came from something everybody had seen a rabbi would come to town and right behind him would be this group of students doing their best to keep up with the rabbi as he went about teaching his yoke from one place to another by the end of a day of walking in the dirt directly behind their rabbi the students would have the dust from his feet all over them and that was a good thing

4529090 about two years ago i watched mary kate smoke a marijuana joint and pass it on to friends when they were all at a party together
4529091 then there were her friends who definitely did drugs i especially remember three hangers on two guys and a girl i would call them drug dealers
4529092 i saw them with cocaine and they also tried to provide it to other people i also saw them with pures which are tablets like ecstasy
4529093 because shes so tiny a little booze would have a big effect on her
4529094 colleagues told me that on at least two occasions she had so much to drink that she had to be carried to her car
4529095 even in high school she liked to drink vodka with fruit juice or mixer mary kate would get so blasted that her sister ashley would pull her aside and tell her to stop

4529106 remains dangerous for thousands of years and no nation on earth has developed an acceptable solution for safely disposing of it
4529107 efficiency programs and renewables such as wind and solar can provide more carbon abatement per dollar while avoiding the downsides of nuclear power
4529108 the supposed nuclear revival is a carefully manufactured illusion that seeks to become a self fulfilling prophecy
4529109 new nuclear power plants are not a solution for americas energy needs
4529110 serious questions of safety security waste and proliferation surround the issue of nuclear power until these questions are resolved satisfactorily environmental defense cannot support an expansion of nuclear generating capacity
4529111 and while it can be argued that the actual risks of nuclear power are far lower than the perceived risks and that coal fired power plants have killed a far greater number of people than nuclear energy most communities do not want nuclear plants nearby

4529118 we fear gravely that we are no longer effectively impacting the burning ones we see this in their response to us some of them drink but many take offense when we tell them that flames bring death most of them think us strange when we offer them water some of them even try to burn us in retaliation others claim they have drunk before and that it didnt work for them obviously going out and simply offering them water has lost its efficacy surely the small numbers attending the well would disappoint the well crafter so many die every hour we need a new approach we request permission to begin carrying lit matches when we go into the city to help put the citizens at ease they will see we how little we differ from them once we have formed relationships built on the common fire we share we can subtly lead them to water and help them want to drink and quench their burning this would far surpass our current approach of confronting them with the water as though we judged them for their flames
4529119 this finding may yield new insights into a form of altered brain activity occurring in schizophrenia
4529120 it may also lead to new methods for screening drugs with potential as schizophrenia treatments
4529121 its analogous to tuning in the weak signal of a distant station on your car radio as opposed to picking up the strong signal of a station thats nearby
4529122 for the first time we were able to show that neuregulin 1 which has been genetically implicated in schizophrenia affects a brain activity that appears to be altered in schizophrenia
4529123 future studies of brain regions rich in erb4 receptors may yield important information on the nature of schizophrenia

4529177 the airlines and swissport will attempt to draft in management and where possible use non unionised workers there will be a risk of delays and this is worst time of year for it to happen at the peak of the summer season when flights are their fullest
4529178 our members are already struggling to keep up with rising food and energy costs this pay offer is an insult to professional hard working men and women who have to operate in extremely difficult conditions our members have had enough
4529179 this strike is totally unjustified union chiefs should be grateful that they are getting any increase at all at a challenging time for the global economy

4529194 i really love the self sufficiency of it that i know where the produce started and what the process is
4529195 especially in the winter when i go down in the basement to get the jars its a nice feeling
4529196 so many things are unknown with the way food is produced that it feels really good to keep control of it
4529197 it fits with what weve seen historically from the 1970s and even before then when people tighten their belts they focus a little bit less on convenience items and convenience foods and focus a little bit more on staying home and making their own whether youre talking about food or fun
4529198 the straw that broke the camels back was the economy
4529199 but the underlying reason is healthier food were tired of food that has tons of sodium preservatives and all the nasty stuff they put in food that you dont have to be eating
4529200 what i hear is the words the economy and weve started growing a garden because we dont know whats going to happen to the economy in the future

4529231 no one wants anyone from perth in any sport to win it
4529232 no one used to like it when we were successful in the old nsl so theyre going on what happened in the previous season
4529233 its a new start this season and everyone starts on zero points so they can go on all they want about sydney or anyone else its up to us every time we step onto the park to prove them wrong
4529234 weve spoken about what we want to achieve this year and our main goal our first goal is to make the top four theres no ifs or buts about that its a must
4529235 once we get there well have another goal to make the grand final and then obviously to win it
4529236 i was at the a league launch in sydney and we were well and truly under the radar no one expects us to do very well well see what happens this year
4529237 within ourselves we want top four and thats what we will be striving for thats a realistic goal i belive we can achieve
4529238 a few of the overseas players no ones seen them play before theyre all new
4529239 a few of the other boys have come from state league teams from around the country so it our squad is a bit unknown i think we are a bit underestimated at the moment

4529246 i think we have everything necessary to win the premier league again and also the champions league
4529247 we have some big games coming up one of those is on saturday at sunderland so we must not play like this again
4529248 we have the quality in our team we just need to step up now and look forward to sunderland we will not play as badly as that again we must improve and we will improve
4529249 we will show everyone and if we progress we have the chance to win the title
4529250 of course manchester united and chelsea are strong sides as are liverpool and tottenham building new teams but i am really confident with the quality we have got

4529264 a player like mark has that experience and is able to fit a certain hole in terms of our squad list
4529265 he was the right person for that position that didnt exist off contract at the moment in rugby in australia
4529266 clinton has travelled a similar path and his opinion is one we respect
4529267 he was adamant that mark will be an absolute hit in the game
4529268 positionally weve obviously got some ideas about him playing in the back three but theres no reason why he couldnt play elsewhere

4529272 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4529273 perhaps we were a little bit behind them in terms of sharpness and match fitness but that is no excuse for tonight
4529274 we need to get up to speed before the weekend and hopefully this game will let us know where we are at and what we need to do
4529275 in the first half we had too many unforced errors and needed to play in their half and not get trapped in our half which is what happened
4529276 in the second half they put people behind the ball and played on the break which they did very well
4529277 we needed to be dynamic and more personality and drive the play fair play to the opposition though they understand the counter attack game and executed it well
4529278 we are short of a few players and are a bit light so were still in the market for players the match is only at half time
4529279 i could not think at all about the game on sunday until we had played tonight but i was very pleased with some of the football we played

4529283 its a challenge to us to reach the level that we reached in auckland and maybe even surpass it
4529284 thats what great teams do consistently reach that level we dont doubt that this team has got the heart to do it but its a big challenge to take that intensity and level offshore and put it to work at newlands

4529408 we knew we could vastly improve the customer experience by deploying an online booking application to enhance our existing web site ibm came in and really pulled the project together in an amazingly short period of time five months compressing a development cycle that was slated to take 12 months
4529409 when customers book a tour the application is simultaneously booking reservations for hotels buses and so on
4529410 we needed our online system to extend the complexities built into our core business systems out to the web without making the process too complicated for our customers the websphere commerce solution did this without having to completely rewrite our back end systems
4529411 this project is a great example of how ibm is helping clients adapt to constantly changing conditions such as rising fuel costs and new terms of engagement between airlines and travel agencies
4529412 using ibm software and soa companies like vantage can make it easier and less expensive for consumers to book vacations while reducing the time and money it takes to manage a complex business and web site like this

4529422 the truth of the assumption defined by pius xii is reaffirmed by the second vatican council which thus expresses the churchs faith preserved free from all guilt of original sin the immaculate virgin was taken up body and soul into heavenly glory upon the completion of her earthly sojourn
4529423 by the mystery of the assumption into heaven there were definitively accomplished in mary all the efects of the one mediation of christ the redeemer of the world and risen lord n christ shall all be made alive but each in his own order christ the first fruits then at this coming those who belong to christ 1 cor 5 22 23 in the mystery of the assumption is expressed the faith of the church according to which mary is nited by a close and indissoluble bond to christ for if as virgin and mother she was singlarly united with him in his first coming so through her continued collaboration with him she will also be united with him in expectation of the second redeemed in an especially sublime manner by reason of the merits of her son she also has that specifically maternal role of mediatrix of mercy at his final coming when all those who belong to christ shall be made alive when the last enemy to be destroyed is death 1 cor 15 26
4529424 connected with this exaltation of the noble daughter of sion through her assumption into heaven is the mystery of her eternal glory for the mother of christ is glorified as queen of the universe she who at the annunciation called herself the handmaid of the lord remained throughout her earthly life faithful to what this name experesses in this she confirmed that she was a true disciple of christ who strongly emphasized that his mission was one of service the son of man came not to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many mt 20 28 in this way mary became the first of those who serving christ also in others with humility and patince lead their brothers and sisters to that king whom to serve is to reign and she fully obtained that state of royal freedom proper to christs discipels to serve means to reign
4529425 it is his love that makes us immortal this love guarantees our immortality and it is this love that we call heaven heaven is simiply the fact that god is great enought to have room even for us miniscule beings and the man jesus who is also god is our everlasting pledge that man and god can forever exist and live in easch other if we grasp this truth then i think we will also have some insight into what the odd words bodily assumption into heavenly glory mean
4529426 the assumption cannot mean of course that some bones and corpuscles of blood are forever preserved somewhere
4529427 nothing of what is precious and valuable to us will be lost christ said on one occasion that the hairs of your head are all numbered mt 10 30 the final and abiding world will be the fulfillment of this earth of ours thus the point we noted at the beginning is once again made clear that christianity is not a religion focused on the past a religion forever changing us to something that took place once upon a time but a religion of hope in what is to come it is a religion that opens the way for us into the future into the definitive and abiding creation precisely as christians we are called upon to build our world and to work for its future so that it may beecome gods world a world far transcending anything we could build by our own powers

4529434 david orchard were pleased to announce is the nominee for desnethe missinippi churchill river
4529435 it feels good to be back in the lab with brandy again
4529436 weve always made great records and im humbled and honored to be continuing our legacy the sound might be new bigger and more uplifting but weve kept our musical promise by making great songs and great music once again there is no musical combination like ours
4529437 wrong on the iraq war wrong on the economy wrong on yucca mountain and wrong on sports betting
4529438 obama and i have put our arms around that sen mccain has said he doesnt like it theres nothing that mccain likes he wants to focus on a problem and not any way of solving it
4529439 its a huge resource but its a largely untapped resource
4529440 i ran out of my house to join 10 people trying to lift up the bus
4529441 at first we couldnt get it up so then another 10 people ran over to help and we got the bus up and the lady out
4529442 the light turned red and i couldnt stop i tried to miss her
4529443 its a terrible poignancy that donnettes sons birthday will now coincide with the day his mother died
4529444 she seemed like she was a very good mother to her
4529445 there are a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4529446 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4529447 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4529448 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4529449 these unsubstantiated spate of reports are totally baseless and malicious
4529450 once they issue impeachment proceedings against him and issue a charge sheet then it will become almost inevitable that he will want to answer those charges
4529451 he feels very strongly that a lot of that is being said is not correct
4529452 we have conveyed to them that the coalition is determined for impeachment and if he wants to save himself the best way is for him to quit
4529453 if a person moves to the side we are not in the habit of bothering him this would not be a good attitude if someone is lying on the ground and we go aggressively against him
4529454 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim
4529455 it just looks like a costume with some fake guys thrown on top for effect
4529456 its not on endangered species on any list that weve got
4529457 the remains of a small gorilla or chimpanzee that may have undergone some taxidermy treatment
4529458 the soaring prices of oil on the global level during these last six years have reminded us of the importance of safeguarding energy security in our homeland
4529459 were raising the energy supply capacity through accelerated energy diversification the utilisation of non fuel oil alternative energy including new and renewable energy such as micro hydro geothermal and biofuel
4529460 in addition to tapping renewable energies we must effectively save energy thus far we have been a nation that splurges on the use of energy
4529461 the whole of society is expected to save whether in private offices or in households
4529462 this is a very significant amount as we can make use of it for the development of our education health infrastructure and even defence
4529463 god willing by the middle of 2009 the power crisis on java and bali will begin to be overcome
4529464 if i feel like a sore throat is coming on
4529465 there is no credible evidence that airborne products will reduce the severity or duration of colds or provide any tangible benefit for people who are exposed to germs in crowded places
4529466 its important to note that this is a settlement over older advertising and labeling and has nothing to do with public safety
4529467 weve offered a money back guarantee for our products since 1997 and we have millions of satisfied customers a class action lawsuit sparked this matter were just one of many major consumer brands across america that are under assault by class action lawyers
4529468 the fact they got away with it for years is not a reason they should not be held responsible for it
4529469 even if airborne isnt doing anything for you believing it helps
4529470 i cant tell you the last time i had a cold
4529471 it is pretty much impossible to prove that it didnt prevent a cold if you dont get a cold
4529472 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still
4529473 hes a fugitive and hes probably seeking refugee status and the thai attorney general would have to prove hes not a refugee and he doesnt deserve to have refugee status and that will be a legal process that will become a political issue in the near future
4529474 well indeed escape to england this time has turned thaksin into a political martyr which will serve to maintain the strength of his party
4529475 my guess is that the samak government will survive for quite a long time much longer than many people suspect
4529476 atrocity of 15th august 1998 was an attack on all of the people of ireland
4529477 as we continue to build a peaceful and a better future it remains an indelible stain on our history that will never be forgotten
4529478 we condemn these attacks which are clearly designed to create tension in the local community
4529479 that keeping our children safe from sexual predators in the 21st century can best be achieved by ensuring that local national and international police cooperate across borders and across the digital divide worldwide
4529480 are running out of places to go and basic necessities
4529481 the tamil tigers are keeping them in harms way and the government is not doing enough to ensure they receive essential assistance
4529482 these measures seem designed in part to use civilians as a buffer against government forces a serious violation of international humanitarian law the tamil tigers have also engaged in forced recruitment
4529483 managing change in an information systems development organization understanding developer transitions from a structured to an object oriented development environment
4529484 what they thought was a bowel blockage was essentially a bowel movement in utero that blocked the one opening she had she was able to breathe the amniotic fluid in like normal but then she wasnt able to pass it which caused the distention
4529485 but shell be ok right once we do the surgery
4529486 yes i think so this is not a common malformation but its not usually fatal either
4529487 we dont usually perform the surgery until theyre about one their anatomy is small right now and the bigger they are the easier it is to repair everything
4529488 integrating a software architecture centric method into object oriented analysis and design
4529489 we are strong supporters of lasting peace in mindanao as a way to achieve development we do not believe that independence for mindanao is appropriate
4529490 be a good deterrent to terrorism good for security and would help spur economic development in mindanao
4529491 i was invited as a member of the diplomatic corp of the philippines
4529492 i have a very honest answer no we do not have plans to have military bases in the philippines not in mindanao not anywhere
4529493 regional countries are capable to do it we all need to protect the iraqi state
4529494 i have never said iran would move in to iraq when america left the country i have just said america is aggressive and it is cruel and it will have to exit from iraq soon
4529495 this issue was underlined during our talks yesterday natural gas and oil agreements take time because they need investment
4529496 turkey is one of most important routes for iran to transport the iranian gas to europe and officials from our two countries are continuing their negotiations
4529497 by this time next year home prices in places like nevada california florida and arizona will not be down 5 as the experts predict but could fall two or three times that number according to
4529498 every day in the gulf coast league youre liable to see something youve never seen before
4529499 ive been advised not to give quotes of any less than a year
4529500 forgive me gentlemen if i dont understand what in the name of mordor your malfunction happens to be
4529501 you did put up a mighty fight worthy of umbar castamir would be proud for he could shatter law with law like a sledgehammer
4529502 if we get to the ruined city many will die those soldiers are not the farmer militias most in the city have fought ive faced the crescent marked ones before and they fight to the death and do it fiercely
4529503 its aggravation like this that will eventually cause me to fireball the entire party as they sleep yes indeed everyone peaceful and quiet and then foom
4529504 the controller hasnt seen any executive order but he would urge the governor to rethink his proposal
4529505 this hasnt been addressed by the courts and if its ruled illegal it could cost the state a tremendous amount in damages
4529506 cutting workers salaries will do nothing meaningful to improve our cash position
4529507 nothing more than a poorly devised strategy to put pressure on the legislature to enact a budget
4529508 we are the victims of the incompetence of the legislature and gov schwarzenegger
4529509 because they cant sit down and pass a balanced budget state workers must live in fear of having their wages slashed as much as 90 percent we are not chess pieces we are real people
4529510 holding state workers hostage is not a fair way to get to a budget agreement
4529511 the finding is significant because it changes our understanding of how light input from the eye can affect activity and sleep patterns
4529512 this suggests that we have discovered an additional mechanism for regulating nocturnity and diurnity that is located in the light input pathways of the eye
4529513 the significance of this research for humans is that it could ultimately lead to new treatments for sleep disorders perhaps even eye drops that would target neural pathways to the brains central timekeeper
4529514 currently one in 28 americans age 40 and over suffer from blindness or low vision and this number is estimated to double in the next 15 years
4529515 our discovery of the switching mechanism in the eye has direct relevance with respect to the eventual development of therapies to treat circadian and sleep disorders in the visually impaired
4529516 its telling us to be here in accord with the reality of fire were not really fighting the fire were meeting the fire letting the fire come to us make friends with it and tame it as it reaches our boundaries
4529517 i refuse to be lectured on national security by people who are responsible for the most disastrous set of foreign policy decisions in the recent history of the united states the other side likes to use 9 11 as a political bludgeon well lets talk about 9 11
4529518 the people who were responsible for murdering 3 000 americans on 9 11 have not been brought to justice
4529519 1 does the president have inherent powers under the constitution to conduct surveillance for national security purposes without judicial warrants regardless of federal statutes mccain there are some areas where the statutes dont apply such as in the surveillance of overseas communications where they do apply however i think that presidents have the obligation to obey and enforce laws that are passed by congress and signed into law by the president no matter what the situation is okay so is that a no in other words federal statute trumps inherent power in that case warrantless surveillance mccain i dont think the president has the right to disobey any law
4529520 a top adviser to senator john mccain says mr mccain believes that president bushs program of wiretapping without warrants was lawful a position that appears to bring him into closer alignment with the sweeping theories of executive authority pushed by the bush administration legal team in a letter posted online by national review this week the adviser douglas holtz eakin said mr mccain believed that the constitution gave mr bush the power to authorize the national security agency to monitor americans international phone calls and e mail without warrants despite a 1978 federal statute that required court oversight of surveillance
4529521 my understanding in talking to the family was he was advised by the judge that should he see her at school he should turn and walk the other way
4529522 we will place him at an off site location so he can continue his education until this matter is resolved
4529523 i think what has come out of this is this is a lose lose situation for everyone the victim and her family are traumatised the whole school community is in shock at whats happened
4529524 the first thing is its obviously totally inappropriate secondly the fact this young woman will have to see that guy every day i have to wonder what the judge was thinking
4529525 we deal with a lot of the victims in these cases and were only too aware of the ongoing ramifications for the victims i have trouble understanding where the judges head is in all this
4529526 hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants
4529527 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile
4529528 you see these athletes driving around the town and walking down the street so the town has a real connection with them
4529529 the world champs is coming in 2010 and the town wants to tune into the sport that will soon be on their doorstep
4529530 i dont know any other town in the country that has these sort of athletes living there its a privilege we have to make a big fuss about them and get in behind them
4529531 he wont have any future in new zealand or anywhere if he cant get sponsorship
4529532 there will be no drives in new zealand and there will be no drives in australia
4529533 because we started off really dry rain is getting to be normal or near normal in most places because of the drought
4529534 you could probably say its been a normal year but youd have to take the drought and rain and mix them together
4529535 weve still got a heavy rain warning for the upper waipa and lake taupo catchments but at the moment all the rivers are still within their banks
4529536 when an action is rationally justified how can reason deny its legitimacy
4529537 this revision of the academic understanding of technology contributes to weakening technocratic rationales for public policy a new era of technical politics has begun
4529538 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
4529539 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
4529540 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
4529541 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
4529542 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
4529543 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
4529544 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
4529545 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
4529546 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
4529547 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
4529548 the schools stare fixedly into the past as we hurtle pell mell into the future
4529549 they are characteristics of the spirit mood language and process of science they are operative wherever evidence of social change can be found
4529550 a new kind of person one who is an actively inquiring flexible creative innovative tolerant liberal personality who can face uncertainty and ambiguity without disorientation who can formulate viable new meanings to meet changes in the environment which threaten individual and mutual survival
4529551 new book out and making the move to open access
4529552 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
4529553 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
4529554 please note that blogger does not remove blogs for containing insults or negative commentary while blogs that contain such content can be distasteful blogger is not in a position to arbitrate disputes
4529555 light is collected over a large area like a window and gathered or concentrated at the edges
4529556 professor baldos project utilizes innovative design to achieve superior solar conversion without optical tracking
4529557 this accomplishment demonstrates the critical importance of innovative basic research in bringing about revolutionary advances in solar energy utilization in a cost effective manner
4529558 track the sun to generate high optical intensities often by using large mobile mirrors that are expensive to deploy and maintain
4529559 solar cells at the focal point of the mirrors must be cooled and the entire assembly wastes space around the perimeter to avoid shadowing neighboring concentrators
4529560 we made it so the light can travel a much longer distance
4529561 we were able to substantially reduce light transport losses resulting in a tenfold increase in the amount of power converted by the solar cells
4529562 the recent education of openness pays no attention to natural rights or the historical origins of our regime which are now thought to have been essentially flawed and regressive it is progressive and forward looking it does not demand fundamental agreement or the abandon ment of old or new beliefs in favor of the natural ones it is open to all kinds of men all kinds of life styles all ideologies there is no enemy other than the man who is not open to everything but when there are no shared goals or vision of the public good is the social contract any longer possible
4529563 is there anything that stands out to you about any of the kids on that row
4529564 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function
4529565 educational reformation a look at the condition of american education
4529566 not only have senator mccain and his agents plainly infringed mr brownes copyright in running on empty but the federal courts have long held that the unauthorized use of a famous singers voice in a commercial constitutes a false endorsement and a violation of the singers right of publicity

4529572 clicking on the headline or the image which is really being loaded from the bbc web site will take e mail readers to a virus laden web page
4529573 the danger is that almost no anti virus products detected this virus when it began to be distributed this morning only 4 of 36 anti virus products knew that this was a suspicious file in our tests this morning
4529574 several of the computers being used to send the new spam campaign are in russia including at least one computer owned by the federal agency of education
4529575 these spam messages serve a dual purpose a propaganda attack against georgia while adding compromised hosts to botnets controlled by pro russian individuals
4529576 this could potentially change the circulation of coastal currents in the gulf of alaska
4529577 if it continues to rise at this rate parts of the state of florida could be under water at the turn of the next century
4529578 our glacier observations are 10 times better and 10 times less costly than data collected the old way
4529579 the finding is significant because it changes our understanding of how light input from the eye can affect activity and sleep patterns

4529584 the massive wildfires raging in california this summer are symptomatic of a trend toward more fires burning larger areas in the western united states over the past few decades
4529585 because it is feeding longer fire seasons drier conditions and more lightning according to recent studies the fire season stretches about 78 days longer and individual fires last about 30 days longer
4529586 increased risk of catastrophic wildfires global warmings wake up call for the western united states
4529587 we must get at the root of the problem and reduce the global warming pollution that fuels more frequent and severe fires
4529588 basically this is a good news story for our regions forests
4529589 it suggests that they will become a bit more productive due to the extra carbon being taken up in the autumn along with the increased photosynthesis throughout the longer growing season
4529590 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4529591 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through

4529594 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4529595 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4529600 the problem is most difficult for obama with older women there are probably a couple of strikes there older people have more concerns about his lack of experience and older women were pretty strong backers of senator clinton
4529601 there is still some indication in pennsylvania that there are still some unhappy clinton voters there fourteen percent of the democrats in the state say they are voting for senator mccain we will have to watch and see where that goes if indeed those democrats come home i e vote democrat then senator obama is probably home free in pennsylvania
4529602 drivers who kill through carelessness will no longer be able to walk away from court with just a fine neither should uninsured or unlicensed drivers who deliberately flout the law driving requires full concentration at all times a moments distraction can make the difference between life and death
4529603 the government is committed to continually improving safety on britains roads
4529604 last year the number of people killed fell below 3 000 for the first time since records began in 1926 but eight people are still dying on the roads each day where carelessness or an uninsured disqualified or unlicensed driver causes a death it is right that the driver should face tough penalties

4529610 se cumple el aniversario de la inauguraci n de este canal que se abri en 1914
4529611 fue inicialmente estudiado en el a o 1534 por instrucci n del emperador carlos v el mismo que promovi los estudios del canal imperial de arag n como v a de navegaci n para cortar la ruta entre espa a y per
4529612 a finales del siglo xviii se demostr su viabilidad y se trazaron los planos de su construcci n en 1855 se concluy el ferrocarril de panam y en 1880 se inici la construcci n del canal la cual se abandon por sus dificultades t cnicas en 1904 los estados unidos adquirieron los derechos de construcci n y explotaci n y se concibi el canal con un sistema de esclusas y lagos artificiales para salvar el desnivel entre los dos oc anos en 1977 panam recuper la soberan a del canal que fue efectiva a partir del 31 de diciembre de 1999
4529613 el canal de panam se ha convertido en arteria del comercio internacional que acorta el tr nsito entre el atl ntico y el pac fico con las ventajas que esto supone no s lo en t rminos econ micos sino tambi n ecol gicos
4529614 surte de agua potable a la ciudad de panam y es una fuente de energ a hidroel ctrica la cuenca hidrogr fica en la que se encuentra alberga un importante patrimonio de biodiversidad natural
4529615 panam cuenta con una estrategia nacional de ambiente y ha dise ado pol ticas espec ficas en materias como la gesti n de las cuencas para sus recursos h dricos la prevenci n del cambio clim tico o la responsabilidad social corporativa de sus empresas industriales en estas cuestiones panam se inspira en las convenciones internacionales de referencia
4529616 el 15 de agosto de 1519 pedro arias d vila fund la ciudad de panam la primera ciudad espa ola en las costas del pac fico y la m s antigua de las fundadas en tierra firme por espa oles en el continente americano

4529618 por primera vez esos recursos se quedan en panam y se invierten en panam ello nos devuelve la esperanza de ser mucho m s de lo que hemos sido la visi n del presidente mart n torrijos ha sido significativa porque gran parte de estos recursos se ha destinado a la educaci n y tenemos m s de 3 000 paname os estudiando en diversas universidades del mundo
4529619 ha sido muy significativo para mejorar las condiciones de vida de los paname os as como la creaci n de fondos de inversi n local que ha supuesto una diferencia importante para una poblaci n paname a que hace cuatro a os un 40 estaba en la pobreza y se han desarrollado infraestructuras importantes que dan oportunidad de cambios a sus vidas

4529623 i think theres a perception these compounds hold untapped potential to help us understand the human mind
4529624 the working hypothesis is that if psilocybin or lsd can occasion these experiences of great personal meaning and spiritual significance then it would allow patients with terminal illnesses hopefully to face their own demise completely differently to restructure some of the psychological angst that so often occurs concurrently with severe disease

4529626 investigators need to be confident that the volunteer could not exit the window if in a delusional state
4529627 the way i view it is we experienced some kind of broad cultural trauma back in the 60s and these drugs became demonised in that context
4529628 as a culture we just decided clinical research shouldnt be done with this class of compounds
4529629 this was partly the federal regulatory authorities it was partly the funding agencies and it was partly the academics themselves leary had so discredited a scientific approach to studying these compounds that anyone who expressed an interest in doing so was automatically discredited
4529630 these drugs these experiences are not for the mystic who wants to sit on the mountain top and meditate they are not for the counter culture rebel they are for everybody
4529631 as the session began and as it built up i felt this lump of emotions welling up and firming up almost like an entity i started to cry a little then it started to dissipate and i started to look at it differently and i think that is the beauty of being able to expand your consciousness i dont think the drug is the cause of these things i think it is a catalyst that allows you to release your own thoughts and feelings from some place that you have bound them to very tightly i began to realise that all of this negative fear and the guilt was such a hindrance to making the most of and enjoying the healthy time that im having however long it may be i was not utilising it to the best and enjoying my life because i was so afraid of what wasnt there yet these substances occur in our natural world and people have been using them for thousands of years to treat physical illness to treat social and behavioural problems

4529634 not al qaeda operatives at a press conference during his latest trip to the middle east mccain was corrected
4529635 mccain has never been diagnosed with or treated at the center for a psychological or psychiatric disorder
4529636 he has been subjected to an extensive battery of psychological tests and following his last examination which was 15 years ago in 1993 we judged him to be in good physical and mental health
4529637 mccain always heard the guards coming with his food but was often so much in his private world that he strongly resented their coming around and bringing him back to reality by intruding he was enjoying his fantasies so much
4529638 findings suggest that it is less what happens at the time of a trauma that predicts ptsd than what occurs thereafter
4529639 the presence of dissociative symptoms after exposure to trauma has been found to predict the subsequent development of post traumatic stress disorder ptsd
4529640 in several studies dissociation at the time of a trauma has been found to predict symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder at follow up assessments
4529641 traumatic dissociation is frequently considered to be a risk factor for post traumatic stress disorder ptsd
4529642 he even admits to an adverse reaction today to the sound of
4529643 an eruption of temper out of all proportion to the provocation
4529644 is john mccain mentally and emotionally fit for the most stressful job in our country that of the president of the united states and our militarys commander in chief

4529653 as a coach it feels great looking at the roster knowing we have an extremely flexible team
4529654 there will be a lot of competition to fill those spots and well be able to adjust the lineups to fulfill our needs with a lot more depth and flexibility than in recent years

4529694 where are the fans best served having us where do we need to be im not intelligent enough to say that we ought to be in kansas versus being somewhere else i dont know i havent looked at attendance statistics enough to make that comment
4529695 i believe its in our best interest to be in as many places as possible and in some cases i dont know where adding a second race somewhere puts us as many places as possible
4529696 wed be better off going somewhere else that we dont go currently
4529697 i dont think its in our sports best interest to run more races
4529698 and thats not because i dont want to do it when im not racing here im racing with my 7 year old but we have to be careful to not have too many races

4529717 not only those people who perpetrated this but those who failed to stop it
4529718 the deployment of new anti missile forces has as its aim the russian federation
4529719 therefore any fairy tales about deterring other states fairy tales that with the help of this system we will deter some sort of rogue states no longer work
4529720 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century

4529741 its such a relaxing pastime and i get plenty of reading done
4529742 some were catching a wee bit but it wasnt a great day
4529743 i dont have any problem with my score on the bars
4529744 i dont have a problem with any of my scores today nastia deserves the gold medal she earned it today
4529745 if you asked me a month ago i would have said that i wont be coming back
4529746 but now after experiencing all this i probably am going to keep going
4529747 i dont have any problem with my score on the bars
4529748 i dont have a problem with any of my scores today nastia deserves the gold medal she earned it today
4529749 if you asked me a month ago i would have said that i wont be coming back
4529750 but now after experiencing all this i probably am going to keep going
4529751 the schedule was definitely a lot harder than i thought it would be to do it twice
4529752 just to tackle 12 swims again counting prelims and semifinals was very challenging
4529753 the mental energy emotional energy and physical energy it takes to go out there every time is incredible to me
4529754 the last one was pretty much a complete disaster so shes way ahead of the game there
4529755 im going to be in this sport a long time
4529756 i want it to be fun there are events i do that i dont really enjoy at all
4529757 the company is committed to this process and recognises the critical role it plays in ensuring the management and protection of the countrys conservation estate
4529758 while its a service for the elderly its also available to anyone at all
4529759 its something we see all the time and its amazing the lengths some people go to
4529760 if i knew this was the law i wouldnt have looked after the dog for my mate its just a quick way for the council to make money
4529761 i was always at him to do it up properly
4529762 wearing a helmet and not fastening it is like having a seat belt and not doing it up
4529763 if you are going to invest in a helmet take the time to get it right
4529764 if its not on right it can be like not having one at all
4529765 if everything goes right they should have a good chance
4529766 there is enough pressure being judged but to have hundreds of people watching every move is pretty scary
4529767 we have won for the last three years in a row and this year we have a very good chance to continue that
4529768 our members are already struggling to keep up with rising food and energy costs
4529769 this pay offer is an insult to professional hard working men and women who have to operate in extremely difficult conditions
4529770 our members have had enough the liberalisation of ground handling services across uk airports has resulted in a race to the bottom which must and will stop
4529771 we will not stand back and allow labour costs to determine whether contracts are won or lost
4529772 swissport is aware of the disappointing news that a small number of union members have voted for strike action at gatwick airport
4529773 swissport believes that a fair offer has been made to the unions in the light of the current economic climate that reflects the cost of living increase
4529774 swissport is working with the airport operator and the customer airlines to minimise disruption to the travelling public
4529775 gmb members can not afford these low pay rises given the rising prices they have to pay for food energy and transport
4529776 the employers the airlines and the airport operator need to adjust their view as to what our members will now accept the only way they have of meeting higher prices passed on to them is to raise their own prices in higher pay rises
4529777 these workers are doing one of the most vital jobs in the airport but are among the lowest paid
4529778 its usually not a lack of planning its the cost of living
4529779 hopefully some of them will be just one offs but things are worse this winter
4529780 its not just beneficiaries but people in jobs often with a number of children a lot of people are mentioning power costs and of course the price of petrol
4529781 the greatest thing weve seen is the families who have irregular or variable jobs that might be affected by the weather that sort of thing and suddenly their income is down
4529782 some will apply for a work and income grant but it wont come quickly enough
4529783 we are also seeing more men sometimes thats to do with having custody of the children maybe for the school holidays and there are costs that havent been sorted out if transports involved the grocery money goes on petrol
4529784 we encourage our foodbank families to come along but its really sad they are finding it too hard they cant afford the petrol and there are no buses in the evening
4529785 within the salvation army palmerston north is known for the generosity of the community
4529786 the models tested here confirmed that the health of individual employees and in particular their mental health is a key contributor to productivity loss
4529787 but these models also attest to how other factors measured by a comprehensive hra like the wellness checkpoint contribute to both impaired performance while at work and time away from work these factors exert their influence on productivity loss that are both independent of health and are considerable in their magnitude above and beyond the contribution of health
4529788 the result in this study is a wealth of information that can be used for shaping and guiding efforts to reduce productivity loss this information can help to build the rationale and consensus for taking action
4529789 health is not the only accessible and measurable candidate for intervention efforts

4529793 im writing a new version of the invisible man for universal
4529794 my take is kind of an extrapolation it actually deals with a nephew of the first character it involves scotland yard getting their hands on the current invisible man and basically saying wow youd be a really good secret agent to send into imperial russia right now it starts off from there i dont want to give too much away but i took what being invisible could mean to the next logical extreme we do a lot of crazy things in it that are sort of far beyond what anyones done with it yet
4529795 i looked out and the fire was shining off the garage i looked out for the safety of everyone in the house my mokopuna my daughter and my nephew then i went out
4529796 you stay home minding your own business and you get picked on with a molotov whats up with this world
4529797 the police asked if we had any beef with local gangs
4529798 i havent got any beef the last people in the house were gang related but i dont carry their s
4529799 i didnt want to look out in case they were going to throw another one
4529800 bloody oath its scary this is supposed to be a peaceful neighbourhood
4529801 you dont like people creeping around your house theres a bit of s going to go down in this neighbourhood i dont know if its gangs or whatever but i know there are certain factions that dont like people here
4529802 will not come at the cost of any other country will not stand in the way of any other country nor pose a threat to any other country
4529803 an environment that maximizes the chances of chinas economic development
4529804 its an attempt to grow economically and increase chinas diplomatic presence while keeping relations with other nations peaceful
4529805 there is a strong consensus in china that the policy will help beijing to increase the middle class and sustain the economic transformation of the country all of which require foreign capital and cooperation
4529806 chinese leaders feel that between now and 2020 they have a strategic opportunity to become a relatively wealthy economy and become the second most powerful country in the world
4529807 beijing decided on a foreign policy and then figured out how to package it to the world
4529808 theres no question that many chinese citizens are deeply resentful of being left behind
4529809 the rest of east asia is increasingly tied up with chinas rise
4529810 clearly one of chinas goals is to be seen as a respected and serious player in asia and globally
4529811 china is proceeding into disputed waters and is moving aggressively to assert its maritime claims
4529812 japan is the only country in asia other than india that could directly thwart chinas rise
4529813 the chinese are building a lot of short and medium range missiles and deploying them on the fujian coast across from taiwan
4529814 roughly 80 percent of the taiwan population eighteen million people are happy with the status quo and do not want reunification on beijings terms
4529815 the only place people are worried about china using force is taiwan
4529816 theres not a lot of evidence that china is picking a fight with the united states
4529817 if the united states doesnt pay attention to the region china japan or another country will step in to replace u s influence
4529818 beijing has shown real skill in diplomacy particularly in the last five years
4529819 china has shifted from the very aggressive and violent policy of the 1970s and 1980s where it was quite willing to use force to a much more diplomatic route in the 1990s

4529828 youd like to see an organization dedicated to the freedom of creative expression right here in town come forth
4529829 from our standpoint it had many hours of broadcast time so it was exposed its not like it was stifled and no one heard it
4529830 in our opinion it was a business decision by disney you have to assume if disney thought theyd make money theyd release it

4529901 we believe that if the fec looks into this they will find what weve known all along that we did nothing wrong
4529902 wal mart seems to be willing to break federal election law in order to stop their employees and all of americas workers from having a fair shot at the american dream
4529903 some reports we received were even more egregious than what was described in the journal story in one case a worker said they were shown a slide that said obama union and then were told why unions were bad all of these tactics seem to be designed to keep workers from demanding better wages decent benefits or fairer working conditions
4529904 unfortunately for wal mart workers this kind of intimidation is nothing new
4529905 what wal mart is doing for novembers election is what it and hundreds of other anti union companies do all the time when workers say they want an union intimidating them to go against their own self interests
4529906 we have seen with our eyes we have looked at and touched with our hands
4529907 do you not know that you are a temple of god and that the spirit of god dwells in you if any man destroys the temple of god god will destroy him for the temple of god is holy and that is what you are

4529910 when elizabeth heard marys greeting the baby leaped in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy spirit and she cried out with a loud voice and said blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb and how has it happened to me that the mother of my lord would come to me for behold when the sound of your greeting reached my eyes the baby leaped in my womb for joy and blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what had been spoken to her by the lord

4529935 hmmm ik zit hier lekker over roze gorillas te dromen laat me
4529936 als je nu niet wakker word gaat je beurt voorbij en zoek ik wel een ander die jou plaats zal innemen je bent zeker niet onmisbaar
4529937 jij bent echt niet van je plaats te branden luie leeuw
4529938 een leeuw loopt door de savanne en jaagt op gnoes en antilopen paart met zijn vrouwtje en heeft een gezin te onderhouden
4529939 nou nu is mijn geduld wel op ondankbare vlegel hup op je benen en wakker worden
4529940 je droomt over baasjes en onderwerping en van het feit dat je misschien gewoon een tam beest bent
4529941 toeter wil je alsjeblieft ergens anders vervelend lopen doen jij weet net als ik dat ik niet medeschuldig ben aan het hele incident
4529942 toeter bleef me beschuldigend aankijken en begon weer te blaten
4529943 le oo zij komt op je graf spoken als je zo door blijft gaan
4529944 ja hallo wil je please ophouden met je gebrul en je gescheld ik wil mijn hoognodige uiltje knappen ik ben toch hoop ik niet verantwoordelijk voor al het leed in deze wereld
4529945 leo jij bent de enige aan wie ik mijn klacht kwijt kan dat begrijp je toch wel het voelt af en toe goed om tegen een lid van een diersoort die mij het leven onmogelijk maakt te kunnen schelden je familie heeft niet zo lang geleden mijn geliefde moeder opgepeuzeld vind jij dat normaal
4529946 ja verschuil je maar voor jou verantwoordelijkheid debiele leeuw doe maar of je neus bloed vandaag of morgen ga ik er aan zie je dat niet kijk uit je doppen leo
4529947 daar zit zeker een kern van waarheid in toeter maar je hoeft mij niet een debiele leeuw te noemen dat kwetst me je kwetst me en dat doet pijn weet je
4529948 wat zei je leo begint je geweten al op te spelen of je lege maag
4529949 ja verschuil je maar voor de harde werkelijkheid leo moetje doen word je vast beter van
4529950 itulah sebabnya saya membuka pintu lebar lebar dan mempersilakan kepada anggota dewan untuk menggunakan hak angket baik menyangkut kebijakan energi kenaikan harga bahan bakar minyak bbm manajemen usaha minyak dan gas atau penyelidikan menyangkut prosedur dan keputusan harga jual gas atau bbm termasuk tentang ekspor impor minyak mentah dan bbm
4529951 kalau presiden setuju sebagai implementasinya jangan menghalang halangi kalau dipanggil
4529952 setelah tiga hari lalu saya telepon dan saya katakan jika tidak keluar pemerintah berarti menghambat angket akhirnya keluar juga
4529953 semua bilangan sebagai ukuran angkanya naik berlipat lipat uang yang paling mudah diukur juga naik segala macam yang bisa diukur naik beliau yudhoyono sangat yakin kalau dinilai dengan ukuran yang substansial akan lolos terpilih lagi
4529954 prasasti sejarah penting di medan mulai telantar hilang sengaja dihilangkan dan dipindahkan ini kenyataan yang ironis saat memperingati 63 tahun kemerdekaan bukti bukti dan saksi kemerdekaan belum dianggap penting pemerintah
4529955 ini terjadi karena pemangku kepentingan baik eksekutif maupun legislatif diisi oleh orang orang yang tidak paham sejarah daerah yang dipimpinnya

4529958 kpu tetap harus menghormati putusan ptun tetapi sebaiknya kpu mengajukan banding dengan mengajukan bukti kuat dalam proses verifikasi faktual yang lalu
4529959 kepalang tanggung sudah sejauh ini setiap pemain pasti ingin menjadi juara olimpiade karena itu kami akan tampil habis habisan di final
4529960 ini merupakan salah satu aspek dari liberalisasi politik yang terjadi di mana peran pasar menjadi amat penting parpol yang umumnya masih belajar dituntut mengikuti kebutuhan pasar agar tetap eksis
4529961 pemilihan kepala daerah secara langsung merupakan contohnya ada yang bilang untuk mengangkat pasir saja ada biayanya apalagi mengangkat seorang kepala daerah
4529962 kelompok parpol yang bergerak bersamaan dan mengabaikan posisi ideologis serta ditambah absennya oposisi ini menyerupai kartel
4529963 tidak perlu didesak karena sesuai ranham 2004 2009 ratifikasi akan dilakukan tahun ini kami baru saja menyelesaikan draf akademik tugas saya hanya di draf akademik kalau proses politiknya di dpr untuk menjadi uu saya tidak bisa menjawab
4529964 tahun ini merupakan momentum politik yang baik jika mundur ke tahun 2009 hiruk pikuk proses politik membuat ratifikasi bukan prioritas lagi
4529965 pemilu bukanlah pesta demokrasi seperti dicanangkan orde baru pemilu adalah hari penghakiman di mana rakyat menjadi hakim untuk memutuskan apakah si calon layak menerima mandat dari kita atau tidak mari cegah para politisi busuk masuk ke dalam jajaran pemerintahan
4529966 kami akan publikasikan nama nama para caleg dan calon presiden atau wakil presiden yang masuk dalam kategori misalnya dalam konteks pelanggaran ham baik mereka yang terlibat aktif dalam pelanggaran ham atau yang selama ini diketahui tidak mendukung proses penegakan ham pasif
4529967 data tanggal 13 agustus kami sudah bisa menerima 176 permohonan saat sistem baru pembuatan paspor ini diterapkan tanggal 28 juli lalu kami malah hanya bisa menerima tujuh permohonan
4529968 kalau buku paspor yang bisa selesai dalam sehari 60 80 buku kalau sudah dalam kondisi normal nantinya maksimal bisa sekitar 150 buku
4529969 kalau dulu kan hanya biometric saja biometric kalau sekarang hanya subsistem dari sistem yang baru
4529970 sistem ini mencegah orang untuk membuat paspor ganda integrasi dengan data pencekalan juga dimaksudkan agar orang yang terkena cekal tak bisa membuat paspor baru kalau dulu data pencekalan kan terpisah dengan sistem pembuatan paspor
4529971 kalau dulu bikin paspor bisa cepat paling dua hari juga sudah selesai sekarang kalau kita enggak dapat nomor antrean terpaksa menunggu hingga hari berikutnya belum lagi menunggu buku paspor selesai bisa sampai lima hari
4529972 namanya juga sistem baru sehingga butuh waktu untuk menyesuaikannya saya perkirakan dalam waktu dua minggu lagi semua bisa berjalan seperti biasanya
4529973 sanksi pidana yang diancamkan dalam pasal tentang penghinaan atau pencemaran nama baik dalam kuhp bersifat alternatif bukan kumulatif dengan demikian bila dalam persidangan ternyata orang yang didakwa sebagai pelaku penghinaan atau pencemaran nama baik itu tujuannya untuk membela kepentingan umum atau membela diri misalnya sebagai wartawan membeberkan perilaku seorang koruptor hal itu juga tergantung penilaian hakim yang mengadili perkara
4529974 ternyata ada catatan untuk pers berbeda harapan kami diselesaikan dengan uu nomor 40 tahun 1999 tentang pers karena jika pakai kuhp wartawan langsung dipenjara kami berharap ada semacam referensi persoalan pers diutamakan memakai uu no 40 1999
4529975 tahun anggaran 2009 pemerintah bertekad untuk memenuhi amanat konstitusi dalam pengalokasian anggaran pendidikan sebesar 20 persen meskipun kondisi anggaran yang masih sangat terbatas dalam rangka memenuhi keputusan mk tanggal 13 agustus 2008 tentang alokasi dana pendidikan yang harus kita hormati maka postur rapbn 2009 dilakukan perubahan dan pemutakhiran
4529976 dalam dokumen tambahan nota keuangan yang disampaikan hari ini dilakukan perubahan asumsi harga minyak sesuai penurunan harga minyak dunia terakhir dengan perubahan asumsi itu anggaran subsidi bahan bakar minyak bbm dan listrik juga mengalami penurunan sehingga akhirnya alhamdulillah anggaran pendidikan sebesar 20 persen dapat dipenuhi meskipun defisit anggaran harus dinaikkan sebesar rp 20 triliun atau menjadi 1 9 persen dari produk domestik bruto pdb
4529977 ini dijadikan momentum untuk hadapi 2009 tapi itu sah sah saja
4529978 kemudian larilah ayah saijah meninggalkan desanya sebab ia merasa sangat takut dijatuhi hukuman jika sampai ia tidak membayar pajak tanahnya padahal ia sudah tidak mempunyai peninggalan apa apa lagi untuk membeli kerbau baru
4529979 saya berpikir kpu tidak peduli dengan sistem yang berlaku di partai tetapi tetap tunduk dengan uu pemilu yang hanya mengakui nomor urut biar tidak muncul masalah yang lebih rumit mengapa kita tidak sekalian saja mengubah uu pemilu
4529980 kita bisa menambahkan aturan bahwa partai peserta pemilu selambat lambatnya dapat memberitahukan sistemnya pada kpu sebulan sebelum pemungutan suara dilakukan
4529981 bayangkan sekarang kalau sudah ada pan dan demokrat ditambah partai golkar rasanya bisa dengan cepat dilakukan
4529982 untuk memperlancar ini uu pemilu bisa diamandemen dalam waktu singkat langkah ini tidak akan memengaruhi jalannya pemilu karena pelaksanaan pemungutannya baru april 2009
4529983 sikap kpu sudah benar dengan berpegangan pada uu memang aturan internal partai politik soal tanpa nomor urut tadi tidak mengikat kpu akan tetapi kpu tetap harus berhati hati ketika pemilu usai nanti
4529984 pak kalau partai demokrat pada pemilu 2009 mengalami kemerosotan apalagi kurang dari perolehan suara pada pemilu 2004 orang pertama yang sedih bahkan menangis dalam hati adalah saya dan bapak karena partai demokrat ini lahir karena saya dengan bapak
4529985 saat itu kami mendampingi menyiapkan saksi a de charge meringankan dan ahli kami menunggu sesuai fungsi dan tugas pengacara
4529986 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4529987 i said to james i dont think ill be calling you in too often to say youre not playing
4529988 i just felt we had to try something different i just felt that was the best way to go to give emre a chance
4529989 it feels good to finally get some rotations in last year i was no 5 out of five middle linebackers and didnt get much work at my position
4529990 the whole thing with my qualifications to get myself in with my grades im just trying to get back on track its been an experience for me just to try to get back into the game
4529991 those issues may turn out to be a blessing for hawaii with lolotai forced to stay home and attend hawaii pacific for a year his path back to the football field runs through manoa where hes intent on proving to himself and others he can live up to the potential he showed in high school
4529992 nobody has seen me play my position since my senior year of high school so for me i kind of have to prove to myself i can still play my position i know theres a lot of doubters out there saying that i got married and im done im kind of trying to show them up
4529993 its been three years since lolotai has seen significant playing time at linebacker in a game his first break since stepping on a football field the first time as a kid his success in high school filled his mind with thoughts of being a star in college but the last couple of years have grounded him and made him realize the importance of working hard every day to hopefully fulfill those high school dreams
4529994 college is like youre playing with a bunch of all stars and youve got to rise above that last year was kind of a learning experience for me i cant just come in and expect to play the position i have to work for it
4529995 im comfortable now but i still have a lot to learn im working real hard on my footwork and my reads and just doing well when im in there getting reps
4529996 i was easing into that i think i got more comfortable as practice went along and i got in there a little more it was a good first day its a marathon not a sprint im going to take it one day at a time were not playing tomorrow we play in a couple of weeks thats the plan to be 100 percent by the time we go to florida
4529997 of course we want him to get well as fast as possible weve been praying for him were keeping him in the loop but the reality is weve got to step up and have somebody play and r j kiesel kauhane and brashton satele are doing a great job running with the ones so far i feel confident that we have the players here to step up
4529998 yesterday we brought out the stopwatch and almost half of our plays in one period were over 40 seconds so we made a big point of telling them last night to get in and out of the huddle because its a tough rule and its going to change college football a little bit we were under 30 seconds for most of the plays today it was great tempo
4529999 i tell the quarterbacks they have tons of responsibility its just the nature of the position and if they dont want it they can get a green jersey they can get a white jersey if they want but theres all kinds of things theyre responsible for and thats one of them
