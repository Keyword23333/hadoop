5370000 all of roubinis predictions banerji observed have been based on analogies with past experience this forecasting by analogy is a tempting thing to do he said but you have to pick the right analogy the danger of this more subjective approach is that instead of letting the objective facts shape your views you will choose the facts that confirm your existing views
5370001 many economists roubini among them argue that some of the unfounded optimism is built into the very machinery the mathematics of modern economic theory econometric models typically rely on the assumption that the near future is likely to be similar to the recent past and thus it is rare that the models anticipate breaks in the economy and if the models cant foresee a relatively minor break like a recession they have even more trouble modeling and predicting a major rupture like a full blown financial crisis only a handful of 20th century economists have even bothered to study financial panics the most notable example is probably the late economist hyman minksy of whom roubini is an avid reader these are things most economists barely understand roubini told me we are in uncharted territory where standard economic theory isnt helpful
5370002 what i found out is that combustion generated particles contain environmentally persistent free radicals
5370003 when the radicals are associated with particles they can apparently exist indefinitely
5370004 the implication is you can have the same environmentally related diseases by exposure to airborne fine particles that you can get from cigarettes
5370005 these airborne free radicals are of interest but i am not sure we are at a point where our scalpel is sharp enough to dissect the individual components of air pollution that cause problems for people
5370006 there are studies that show that modifying free radicals can alter the course of disease
5370007 but the implications of this what it means to clinics what it means to doctors what it means to regulators i think we are a long way from pulling that together
5370008 we hope to resolve these matters amicably and put them behind us so we can continue working in partnership with the band to take them to even greater levels of success

5370019 unhealthy relationship on an emotional level with a female member of his staff
5370020 studies show that participants disapproved of infidelity that involved sexual intercourse disapproved less of emotional only infidelity and were most disapproving of relationships that involved both sexual activity and emotional connection glass amp wright 1985 thompson 1984
5370021 for example for women there generally appears to be a greater emphasis on emotional connection than for men whereas for men there generally seems to be a greater emphasis on sexual experience

5370024 research has suggested that once people form an initial impression of someone or something they seem to have a hard time convincing themselves that what they once believed is actually untrue daniel gilbert a psychology professor at harvard calls this
5370025 researchers have discovered that surprisingly small factors where we meet someone whether their posture mimics ours even the slope of their eyebrows or the thickness of their chin can matter as much or more than what they say about themselves we size up someones trustworthiness within milliseconds of meeting them and while we can revise our first impression there are powerful psychological tendencies that often prevent us from doing so
5370026 the junction was altered last september with the aim of improving the flow of traffic
5370027 but while the scheme has helped vehicles merge more freely from the a556 there have been increased delays on the main carriageway
5370028 to combat this problem the highways agency is now planning to reinstate three lanes on the main carriageway and adapt the hard shoulder to provide a long auxiliary lane for traffic joining the motorway from the a556
5370029 the changes to the junction layout are causing chaos for commuters trying to get to work
5370030 the enormous increase in congestion is adding more than 30 minutes to a journey that used to take an hour
5370031 ive generally had a trouble free journey of about an hour each way but since the changes it has become a nightmare
5370032 traffic was fine until this disaster of a decision its morning mayhem and accidents will almost certainly happen
5370033 we have monitored and evaluated the scheme and listened to drivers which is why we are embarking on this new work
5370034 we understand the frustration of motorists using this route over the last few months and we appreciate not only their feedback but also their patience during the preparation of the new scheme
5370035 although its not possible to eradicate delays entirely the changes we intend to make should improve the situation significantly

5370044 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5370045 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5370046 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up

5370095 estas leyes promulgadas est n apegadas a la constituci n
5370096 el jefe de estado s est facultado para dictar leyes org nicas cumpliendo el requerimiento de enviarlas a la sala constitucional del tribunal supremo de justicia tsj
5370097 en 2007 se publicaron 20 leyes muchas de stas a la espera de la propuesta de reforma constitucional que al no darse se tuvieron que reformular las legislaciones de manera que se mantuvieran dentro del texto constitucional vigente
5370098 estuve tentado a titular este art culo de manera distinta por ejemplo
5370099 en venezuela en mi punto de vista vivimos cambios intensos mas no una revoluci n todav a hay muchas cosas del pasado mucho lastre que no logramos superar la trama heredada opera como controlador del proceso y tardar tiempo para que sus logros se perciban con nitidez y se consoliden pero estamos viviendo tiempos de cambio estos se est n dando y quiz sea ste el rasgo m s significativo en libertad y en democracia con arreglo al estado de derecho consagrado en la constituci n de 1999
5370100 esos cambios tropiezan a cada instante con poderosos obst culos obst culos que colocan en el camino grupos econ micos poderes transnacionales viejos h bitos pol ticos y en general un pasado cargado de negatividad de revanchismo y la voluntad de garantizarse a como d lugar que las cosas sigan siendo como eran
5370101 la facultad del parlamento de habilitar al jefe del estado para dictar decretos con fuerza de ley siempre estuvo consagrada en el ordenamiento constitucional venezolano y la ejercieron los gobiernos en diferentes etapas de nuestra historia no es una novedad y menos a n un golpe de estado o una violaci n de la carta magna como algunos lo plantean
5370102 lo que sucede es que ahora se legisla con otro signo con otra orientaci n pero los 26 decretos leyes aprobados por ch vez en el marco de la habilitaci n que le otorg la asamblea nacional son inobjetables la otorg con la mayor a requerida la representaci n popular y la ejerce un presidente electo por el pueblo
5370103 va en el mismo dise o de los proyectos de 2001 con las leyes habilitantes que estaban destinadas a una mayor injerencia del estado y adem s lesionar la propiedad privada
5370104 aqu el problema no es el control del estado de las instituciones es la confiscaci n la ocupaci n de los espacios sociales y por eso se habla de un neototalitarismo que es distinto a la dictadura pol tica
5370105 que el mandatario venezolano tras decretar la semana pasada leyes que fueron rechazadas en el referendo de 2007 sobre una reforma constitucional inici nuevos pasos para implementar el socialismo en el pa s y lograr la reelecci n continua
5370106 el presidente de la rep blica con la participaci n del tribunal supremo de justicia han desconocido la constituci n vigente han pisoteado el estado de derecho han impedido el derecho a la participaci n han aplicado una sistem tica estrategia de desinformaci n han actuado de manera arbitraria ilegal y contra el inter s y la opini n del pa s
5370107 26 leyes que el gobierno aprob en las ltimas horas aprueban las mismas cosas y peores a las que el pueblo venezolano dijo no el 2 de diciembre

5370117 its a whole new kind of car for a whole new kind of people who really dig driving
5370118 its not how young you are its how old you arent
5370119 while the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5370120 no that is not the case the 1970 camaro is in fact the first of the second generation camaros there might be some parts interchangeability with the 69 camaro but a 1970 camaro has more in common with a 1981 camaro or a 1976 nova platform wise than it does with a 1969 camaro
5370121 the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5370122 your point seems to be that they are basically the same car and then you try to explain it away by saying that you meant that they were both f body cars

5370165 en el congreso la derecha tiene mayor a la candidatura de lugo cont con el respaldo del partido liberal radical aut ntico plra de ideolog a de derecha y representante de terratenientes
5370166 ellos van a defender sus intereses y no van a aceptar ninguna ocupaci n de tierras ni reducci n de los latifundios
5370167 lugo est en una posici n m s de izquierda ya sali a decir que cree que las ocupaciones de tierras son leg timas como ltima instancia en la negociaci n pol tica y respalda la lucha de los campesinos por una reforma agraria integral sin embargo creemos que se va a encontrar con muchas contradicciones va a tener que asumir algunos acuerdos con la burgues a por ello el movimiento social se est preparando para apoyar las posiciones del presidente lugo y llegado el momento presionar para que se concreten los cambios
5370168 ni bien gan lugo los compa eros se organizaron y empezaron a ocupar tierras especialmente en el norte del pa s donde hay una zona muy conflictiva y donde el movimiento campesino est m s organizado e ideologizado
5370169 el an lisis realizado por nuestro movimiento es que este no es un momento estrat gico para presionar no se puede presionar al gobierno saliente que no va ofrecer garant as ni soluciones y tampoco al entrante al que hay que darle un poco de tiempo para ver si efectivamente cumple con lo que ha prometido
5370170 creo si que los compa eros en el interior est n preparados para ocupar como una medida de fuerza que me parece correcto y creo que el movimiento campesino est lo suficientemente maduro pol ticamente para tratar primero de agotar las instancias institucionales para despu s en caso de que no se cumpla con lo prometido comenzar a presionar
5370171 tambi n hay una presi n sobre todo de los medios de comunicaci n para crear en la opini n p blica una opini n desfavorable al gobierno de lugo creando temor y miedo
5370172 cuando el gobierno act e tocando intereses pol ticos fuertes la oposici n e incluso el partido liberal integrante de la coalici n de gobierno va a presionar para defender sus privilegios van a tratar de desestabilizar sectores para defender esos privilegios
5370173 y es b sicamente por eso que creo que mucho del peso pol tico que va a tener lugo depender de si puede llevar a cabo una reforma agraria integral
5370174 hay casi un mill n de empleados p blicos una clase media que vive directa o indirectamente de los recursos del estado
5370175 esas estructuras represivas siguen existiendo y lamentablemente ser dificil romperlas hoy d a los compa eros siguen siendo torturados en las c rceles del interior siguen siendo secuestrados por la polic a est n presos en situaci n ilegal siendo ocurriendo asesinatos pol ticos el a o pasado nos asesinaron a un compa ero y en lo que va de este a o han asesinados otros dos compa eros del movimiento y esto en un marco de democracia de elecciones y de libertad de expresi n
5370176 por sobre todo la acci n del nuevo gobierno estar focalizada en que los ministerios sean eficaces en sus gesti n que la salud la educaci n funcionen hay que recordar que en 61 a os en el poder el partido colorado ha creado una maquinaria impresionante de asistencial smo usando los recursos del estado en su beneficio y distribuyendo empleos p blicos y van a defender sus privilegios
5370177 espero que ojala se cumpla con lograr que los servicios del estado funcionen debidamente eso ser a un buen primer paso
5370178 en los ltimos a os el movimiento social se ha fortalecido ha logrado parar las privatizaciones la ley antiterrorista y fundamentalmente es el movimiento campesino el que m s capacidad de movilizaci n tiene creo que los compa eros del movimiento social est n conscientes de la necesidad de defender la institucionalidad en este momento
5370179 se logr acumular bastante fuerza y constituirse en el movimiento que present y apoy la candidatura de fernando lugo despu s en el trabajo se lograron acordar algunos proyectos program ticos lamentablemente en las discusiones program ticas en la coalici n fueron mimetizadas
5370180 ahora el gran desaf o es hacer un buen trabajo en los ministerios lograr una buena gesti n pero sin negligenciar el movimiento social de base que dio apoyo y crecimiento a todo esto
5370181 tomaron distancia del movimiento social concentr ndose sus cuadros en ocupar los lugares del gobierno y eso no permiti que el propio partido se dinamice
5370182 el gran desaf o seguir creciendo con la base seguir formando y construyendo el poder popular que es lo nico que nos va a garantizar un movimiento social ideologizado que nos va a permitir en el futuro y creo que es v lido para toda am rica latina poner freno a pol ticas neoliberales capitalistas para mi la nica forma concretar un cambio social estructural es constuyendo el poder popular

5370204 but i wanted to after she tricked navy into having sex with her
5370205 she fixed herself up real pretty for navys graduation party
5370206 the kids didnt even recognize her and navy liked her new look so much that he took her up to his bedroom where were you that night lacey
5370207 and navy wouldnt even talk to her she ended up losing the baby
5370208 so after all these years she killed him for it
5370209 i think she would have been okay if her mother hadnt died after that she just kind of went over the edge she moved here and got a job working for cash crawley and she had some kind of relationship with bull crawley as well
5370210 how did she get the fish oil into the coffee cake
5370211 she knew about navys allergy and the epi pen she did it while navy was delivering my stolen recipe book to cash crawley
5370212 shes on her way to the morgue she drove her truck into the back of a tractor trailer rig
5370213 right before she drove away from me she ate a handful of castor beans
5370214 theyre seeds that are produced by the castor plant but they call them beans because thats what they look like if you squeeze the beans you get castor oil its used in a lot of different kinds of products
5370215 my momma used to give us kids castor oil when we needed a laxative
5370216 thats one of the uses but castor beans also produce something else ricin
5370217 silvy gave both cash and bull a castor plant she grew them at the nursery in gilmer where she had been working the crawley brothers didnt even know what it was or how dangerous it was they didnt know how dangerous she was
5370218 so she was planning to kill the crawley brother too
5370219 no she just wanted to let them know that she could have killed them although she did spike their coffee with some kind of very strong laxative theyre not feeling too well at the moment but theyll survive
5370220 the gun you gave me to hold onto it was not dannys gun it belonged to manny
5370221 the chief thinks that manny had hired him to shoot navy but danny got cold feet and then when navy died danny tried to take credit for the murder so he could still get paid apparently thats what got him killed im sorry to have to tell you that sweetie
5370222 and hes not dumb hes just a little young and bull headed but hes gonna be okay
5370223 this is it for me im hanging it up the only reason i got involved this time was because of lacey
5370224 so what if its one of us next time ginge
5370225 well thats what you get for telling just one of us
5370226 im fine but i cant say the same for cash or bull
5370227 maybe a little bit but they had it coming they used me
5370228 die its just a strong laxative i put it in their coffee it wont kill them but hopefully it will make them wish they were dead
5370229 what did he do to you back in high school molly
5370230 youre just going to drive away come on molly you know you want to get if off your chest
5370231 my mom and i moved here the summer before my freshman year there were only three new kids in high school that year the other two were boys basketball players and they were pretty good so kids accepted them as though they had lived here all their lives i wasnt so lucky
5370232 my hair was long and oily and i had to wear stupid ugly glasses and a name like castorside is just too easy to make fun of some guy called me molly castor oil the nickname stuck i was suddenly the best known most hideous girl in the whole high school even upper classmen began to recognize me in the hall and call me by name
5370233 i started wondering what would happen if had a major makeover maybe then i could get rid of the nickname and people would start liking me my mom took me to the eye doctor and got me some contacts even though she couldnt really afford it then she got my hair styled and taught me how to put on makeup
5370234 no he didnt make me do anything i wanted it and it was wonderful being in his arms he wanted me so badly it made me feel good but then later one of the girls realized it was me and started telling everybody they laughed at navy for sleeping with molly castor oil then he started making fun of me too i ran out of there crying
5370235 and thats not all navy wouldnt answer my calls and when i went to his house they wouldnt let me through the gate he wanted nothing to do with me even after i found out i was pregnant with his baby
5370236 then i lost the baby but i told momma i could not go back to that school we moved to gilmer and she got a job working for a florist i worked there too part time
5370237 and i guess thats how you kept them alive in the winter you had access to a greenhouse
5370238 but why did you give castor plants cash and bull were you planning to kill them
5370239 not really but i figured theyd find out how dangerous the plants were after id gone and realize how easily i could have poisoned them maybe theyll think twice about how they treat women in the future
5370240 it was easy i knew about his allergy to shellfish at his graduation party one of the kids brought crab dip navys mother freaked out when she thought hed eaten some of it she demanded to know where his epi pens were when he told her he only had one left and that it was in the car where he always kept it she yelled at him for not having any in the house this is life or death stuff navy and one of these days your stupidity is gonna get you killed she said
5370241 so you figured he still kept it in the car
5370242 yeah i did it while he was delivering your recipe book to cash once i had found the epi pen in the glove compartment all i had to do was inject the fish oil into the coffee cake
5370243 and you knew if somebody else ate the cake it wouldnt hurt them
5370244 right the worst thing that could have happened was some old lady at the nursing getting an extra moist coffee cake
5370245 and you figured the police would suspect cash as the killer once they found out he had hired navy steal my recipe book
5370246 yeah but i never thought about lacey getting the blame ive got nothing against her she was one of the few kids who didnt make fun of me
5370247 so you moved here to coreyville just to get even with navy
5370248 she had a brain tumor she had been having these awful headaches i finally talked her into going to the doctor two weeks later she died
5370249 its no excuse for what ive done i know that but i had to do it
5370250 the thing i dont understand is why you killed danny
5370251 i hate bother you so late chief in fact im surprised youre still in the office its nearly 10 00
5370252 yes its some sort of pistol it belongs to danny iper
5370253 well how did you come into possession of his gun
5370254 lacey greendale took it from him the other night and
5370255 well yes she didnt want it in her apartment so she brought it to me and i put it in my safe
5370256 you didnt clean it or wipe it off did you
5370257 no i barely touched the thing i dont like guns
5370258 but since lacey was dannys girlfriend im afraid shes in danger too
5370259 so i really wish you would send an officer over to her apartment to keep watch
5370260 ill do that right now see you in five minutes
5370261 he had diarrhea most of the night he thought he was over it this morning but then it hit him again he looked very pale and weak we made him go to the hospital
5370262 look i know youre busy but could i ask you one more thing
5370263 that might be the woman i saw in bulls office the other day i knocked on his door and went in he was in the middle of something if you know what i mean she was a beautiful young blonde way too young for him if you ask me
5370264 all i can say is that barack obama will have his work cut out for him in this falls debates if this is at all an indication of how the two of them perform on the same stage
5370265 for obama the goal was to impress a largely skeptical audience of conservative evangelicals that he is a man of strong values and christian faith and that there are areas of common ground between them for mccain the goal was to remind the evangelical audience that theyre really on the same page when it comes to social issues notwithstanding his denunciation of the religious right eight years ago what we saw last night from the rev rick warrens saddleback church was both candidates doing what they set out to do it was a success for obama and mccain for entirely different reasons
5370266 the audience was primarily evangelical christians a group among whom mccain leads by better than 2 to 1 according to recent polls that means that if mccain did any worse than twice as well as obama it counts as a win for obama and from where i sit mccain didnt come close to doing twice as well my sense is that obama struck a lot of previously skeptical evangelicals as a reasonable and god fearing man a real achievement given that so many of the questions touched on issues that favor republicans among these voters abortion judges stem cell research etc thats a big improvement in light of where obama started advantage obama
5370267 i think both candidates had a positive performance obamas was better and probably more tailored to the specific audience it certainly didnt seem forced however given that this is an audience likely leaning towards mccain to begin with obama may have allayed some fears but i dont think he overcame the gap in short he won a non event
5370268 for better or worse obama seems to have chosen to treat this event as sort of an intimate evening with rick warren that just happened to be nationally televised mccain by contrast treated it as a straight campaign event he had his stump speech talking points ready and he was eager to cram as many of them into his 50 minutes as possible i dont know if this was a good decision on obamas part but i dont have any doubt that hell choose a much more direct speaking style at his three face to face debates with mccain
5370269 obama tried to be thoughtful in all his responses some people say he takes too long to answer but i think hes just trying to think before he responds in the debates he will have to be quick on the draw and powerful but he looked comfortable and sincere mccain is very good in these intimate settings put him on snl or jay leno and he does very well thats something that shouldnt be taken lightly by us or the obama camp
5370270 the saddleback congregation applauded obama very nicely but as i hear this california evangelical audience cheering mccain far more wildly for everything from offshore drilling to gay marriage to taxes and clapping for every tired old stump line like its the first time hes said them i really have to wonder whether this outreach is going to add up to anything i know its a small sample but as warren points out social conservatism is not just about religion its a worldview and mccain is the one who shares it not obama
5370271 senator obama i hope you learned something yesterday on the saddleback church store stage the thoughtful considered answers you craft in hopes of sharing your faith with the greedy prosperity xtians arent going to sway them john mccains angry snappish answers his rigidity his soundbiteiness his clarity provoked rabid applause your cautious conversational style as you tried to reveal what moves you and how your faith manifests itself not so gripping
5370272 i dont know how to say this more clearly if john mccain can perform during the three debates the way he is performing tonight with rick warren he will win this election the contrast between him and barack obama who answered the same questions an hour before him has really been quite startling
5370273 i dont want to get to overheated about what occurred tonight but i do think mccain had a clear and decisive victory over obama it all comes down to something that recently said about obama instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives by that standard mccain did extremely well and obama did very poorly
5370274 it was clear that mccain was the crowd favorite that was hardly a surprise at a small gathering i attended a few years ago someone asked warren how many of his parishioners voted for john kerry he thought for a moment and said 15 percent so the conservative saddleback crowd while happy to see obama in their midst was not going to be on his side what they wanted was proof that john mccain was on theirs and thats what they got
5370275 all i can say is that barack obama will have his work cut out for him in this falls debates if this is at all an indication of how the two of them perform on the same stage mccain was really at his best and the contrast played to his strengths obama was long winded and wishy washy in his answers while mccain was short and to the point rick warren even had to ask him additional questions because he finished them so much more quickly than obama if this were an actual debate it would have been a blowout obama looked every bit like the rookie against a seasoned not washed up veteran
5370276 i agree that mccain did better than obama obamas greenness occasionally showed and it is clear that the two candidates cant really compare in life stories even if obama does a better job of writing about his mccain was more effective at connecting with the audience and displaying his sense of humor
5370277 in the first fifteen minutes mccain had established a moral seriousness stemming from his conduct in vietnam as a pow and his long time as a national leader that obama cant match throughout the rest of the night he brought up iraq al qaeda and the georgia crisis when obama was more inward looking mccain sounded like a potential commander in chief obama more like a potential friend as for the social issues tonight should throw a damper on the notion that obama is going to make major inroads among evangelicals voters why would they vote for his social liberalism couched in exquisite equivocations when they can vote for someone who agrees with them on most everything like john mccain
5370278 answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5370279 barack obama refuses to address the defining civil rights issue of our time
5370280 as president even as senator obama is expected to have an answer for this quite literally there is no higher pay grade in the us government and abortion is one of the issues he has to face if he cant face it then he should go back to community organization and leave politics for people who can john mccain had no trouble answering the same question obama dodged it and for good reason his answer would have exposed his radical views
5370281 at saddleback barack obama responded to the question addressed to him by rick warren on abortion as being above my pay grade those who have dug into his record in the illinois senate however have found evidence that obama is a devout believer in what might be called the sacramental or positive good view of abortion nothing can be allowed to interfere with the unfettered exercise of the purported right including the accident of an infant born alive
5370282 the consensus on yesterdays forum at saddleback valley community church is that senator mccain had an exceptional night that rick warren pulled off a very difficult job and that senator obama was smooth as usual except for his above my pay grade gaffe which is one of those phrases that will stick and hurt
5370283 nicolle wallace a spokeswoman for mr mccain said on sunday night that mr mccain had not heard the broadcast of the event while in his motorcade and heard none of the questions the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous ms wallace said
5370284 the notion that mccains suffering as a pow guarantees his honesty in all transactions for the rest of his life would have to improve a lot to be ridiculous there is simply no logical connection i can imagine between former prisoner status and honesty in fact we know that mccain has cheated on many occasions starting with cheating on his wheelchair bound first wife with a string of girlfriends the richest of whom became his second wife
5370285 wow yes lets talk about outrageous using mccains prisoner of war status to now claim that he can never be called on a lie to suggest that former pows dont lie about anything so dont you dare ask them that is simply a bizarre thing to reference mccains pow days when asked whether mccain was prepped for a debate it feels awfully desperate and a little bit crass too
5370286 whats mainly impressive here is the versatility of the defense the insinuation that john mccain a former prisoner of war burnt the toast is outrageous the insinuation that john mccain a former prisoner of war thinks
5370287 this is all part of a pattern when called out for a factual error in something so trivial yet memorable as using dominant pro football teams of an era to patronize forty year old dig in at hippies he has used the pow card to say he isnt a racist evidence to the contrary notwithstanding he has used the pow card to excuse years of voting against issues he just used the pow experience again to apparently plagiarize solzhenitsyn classy the guy just died but then again how dare i accuse john mccain of this he was a war hero only democrats with and who actually had to kill a man in personal combat are worthy of being called deceitful or wimps
5370288 the obama camp and its media water carriers are seriously accusing john mccain of cheating in his appearance over the weekend at rick warrens saddleback church forum because he was in his motorcade when the program started and then escorted to an empty room without media hook ups
5370289 i understand the obama people are mad but if they are going to accuse mccain of cheating to members of the media theyd better dang well have some proof i dont lay blame on petty staffers though i expect them to gripe after a bad performance by their boss i dont expect their whining to be legitimately reported without any skepticism so my question is this is it fair for andrea mitchell to put out what the obama people are saying privately true or not
5370290 remember back in 2004 when george bush trounced john kerry in the debates the left saw a funny shape under bushs jacket and immediately decided bush must have had answered piped to an earpiece from karl rove that was the only way he could have done so well a variation on that happened over the weekend andrea mitchell and nbc are in full cover mode for the obama campaign to undo obamas self inflicted damage the new york times too is pushing the mccain knew the questions story it is the only way they can explain how well mccain did and how poorly obama did
5370291 its exceptionally stupid of mccain not to have arrived on time and observed the terms about isolation knowing what the left would do with it michael crowley at tnr is right that hes not the type to cheat but er a good way to prove that youre not the type to cheat is to actually follow the rules youve agreed to mccain seems to have assumed people would give him the benefit of the doubt simply because hes mccain a show of mind boggling naivete in the middle of an election so another home run ends up with an asterisk next to it
5370292 yes yes we get it john mccain is so famously reluctant to discuss his pow experience or exploit it for political gain that he manages to bring it up in the context of wildly unrelated questions about his affection for 1970s era scandinavian pop acts
5370293 what mccain was shot down in said i apologize for maybe being a little reluctant because i really believed that i served in the company of heroes he only discusses it when he has absolutely no alternative to see blender magazine heartlessly sweeping aside mccains protestations and dragging his most private closely guarded secrets out into the spotlight like that it just tears at your heart doesnt it
5370294 i think there is pretty solid evidence that mccain s just copying other peoples shit the other possibility is that mccain really thinks this happened to him and cant differentiate between something he read and something he actually experienced my guess no one will ask mccain about it for fear of being accused of questioning his patriotism
5370295 its entirely possible that this type of scene happened at a prison camp more than once and there are differences between the two stories this is not something you can prove or disprove but that didnt matter in 2000 al gore said he invented the internet and that he found love canal and that he and tipper were the inspiration for love story thats what happened and there was no shaking anyone in the media off of that and they were going to use those and other nuggets to build a story about gores serial exaggerations
5370296 if i were a reporter i would check it out for instance by asking people who were prisoners with mccain whether they had heard this story at the time since im not a reporter i plan to reserve judgment
5370297 ive now heard this story countless times mccain has used what appears to be an intensely personal moment in a prison camp as a reason to vote for him in a as he tells it today it was the pivotal moment in his struggle to survive in the hanoi hilton and yet in his first thorough account of his time in captivity in 1973 the hauntingly like that recounted by solzhenitsen as told in luke veronis the sign of the cross i have one simple question when was the first time that mccain told this story
5370298 first serious crisis internationally since the end of the cold war
5370299 since the fall of the soviet union the u s has fought or is fighting two wars in iraq a war in afghanistan and two conflicts in the balkans there have been multiple crises in israel there was a burgeoning nuclear crisis with north korea there is and has been a crisis in darfur there have been multiple shall we say tense moments between pakistan and india nuclear powers both one could make the argument that the attacks of sept 11 were themselves a serious international crisis and yet theres john mccain describing a regional conflict between russia and georgia as the first serious crisis internationally since the end of the cold war do the other crises simply not count or does mccain not remember them taken in isolation mccains frequent confusion about foreign affairs may seem like inconsequential verbal miscues but taken together the presumptive republican nominee appears to have no idea what hes talking about
5370300 mccains new and improved talking points iraq is just a regional conflict and georgia is the true epicenter of the glorious struggle for western civilization the stupid just never think progress
5370301 beyond mccains seemingly poor memory the interesting thing is the confusion in terms of high level concepts it was just a little while ago that mccain was giving speeches about how the threat of radical islamic terrorism is transcendent challenge of our time now russia seems to be the transcendent challenge which is the problem with an approach to world affairs characterized by a near constant hysteria about threat levels and a pathological inability to set priorities
5370302 one of the great threats we face is the personal sense of grandiosity of the lead foreign hands who shape the course of our role in the world not national grandiosity but personal grandiosity because if youre a foreign policy hand or political leader your own quest for greatness is constrained by whether or not you live in times of grand historical events theres a lot of this nonsense floating around today by pampered commentators who want to find a new world historical conflict to write bracing commentary about before were done with the one from last week but john mccain might be president in six months and whether its his own shaky judgment temperament or just the desire to find a campaign issue this loose cannon is a real threat to this country
5370303 this is serious im not trying to score political points here one way or another the next president will have to deal with our shattered reputation abroad and the challenges predictable and unpredictable that the next eight years throw at us we cannot afford to elect another president who really doesnt get these things anyone who thinks that the war with georgia is the first serious international crisis since the end of the cold war or who can say without apparent irony that in the 21st century nations dont invade other nations is just not up to the job
5370304 wow mccain s more out of touch than we thought
5370305 like everyone else in dc im pondering the so called veepstakes in sen evan bayh de sen joe biden ri sen jack reed ks gov kathleen sebelius except unlike a lot of people im having a hard time developing really strong opinions about it which reminds me of one pretty strongly held opinion of mine we should eliminate the office of the vice presidency when you think about it its exceedingly odd the vice president has no formal role in the conduct of government to speak of and yet since the end of world war ii the choice of vp has been very important not so much because the vice president is an important person but because no many vps go on harry truman richard nixon lyndon johnson george hw bush to become president while others al gore hubert humphrey walter mondale become major party nominees consequently even though the office is trivial the choice is very important but the choice is also fairly important politically to the person who does the choosing therefore would it be good for this person to become a presidential nominee gets relatively little consideration during the decision making process relative to would s he be a good surrogate give me a bounce help with a state even though it really ought to be the primary consideration beyond that you have the dick cheney paradox it seems perverse to have a vice president who doesnt do anything but a vice president who does too much becomes a destabilizing influence within the government nobody really knows who he speaks for and he can influence things in ways that provide for no accountability
5370306 nashville tn local resident nathan corbin 37 has set a strict 10 a m curfew for his 16 year old daughter kathy the underbearing father told reporters tuesday rules are rules she has to be through the door or at least passed out on the lawn by no later than 10 in the morning on school days said corbin adding that kathy is no longer allowed to have more than three boys in her room at one time ive also warned her on several occasions to keep it down when she comes home because her 14 year old brother kevin has usually smoked quite a bit of pot by that time and is asleep on the couch corbin admitted to recent laxness in enforcing his no stealing more than 35 a week from your stepmother policy but defended indulging his daughter citing the increased cost of cigarettes
5370307 the stewards contributed close to a quarter of a million dollars last thursday when they opened the solevu
5370308 actually this will be the last time any group or province will be opening the solevu because as of next year we will still have the solevu and choir competition but no one will open it
5370309 today yesterday is the youth day and we are expecting around 40 choirs from churches circuits and divisions around the country
5370310 most of the youths have been here since 11 am while waiting to sing at the podium
5370311 most of the old scholars look forward to helping out after work and some take their leave at this time of the year to help out
5370312 we are responsible for coordinating the choirs as they reach furnival park and how they would be placed until they reach the podium to sing
5370313 we have experienced a lot of changes and they include the changes socially politically and economically with the people and the churches and the ministers need to be on par with these changes all the time
5370314 so it is important to the ministers to upgrade their knowledge theological education and the knowledge of secular context all the time
5370315 this regrettable and unfortunate situation of fiji not participating in the forum meeting in niue arises because of the decision taken by the government of new zealand
5370316 a part of the niue forum meeting the bi lateral meetings will be held in auckland but the members of the fiji delegation are being denied the opportunity to participate in those meetings and these meetings are integral to the forum meeting
5370317 this is because the new zealand government has decided not to issue visas to enable fiji to participate
5370318 i wouldnt like to think the withdrawal would have any implication on fijis membership in the forum
5370319 the leaders would have wanted to listen to his side of the story directly but that will not be possible now
5370320 this is niues forum not new zealands no forum events are being held in auckland
5370321 the forum members wanted a definite date i wanted flexibility and an in principle understanding so the date could be reviewed if we were not able for good reason to meet that particular election date
5370322 now the forum meeting this week will discuss the forum foreign ministers report following their recent visit to fiji in july
5370323 the interim government has received that report and we are dismayed and disappointed with that report
5370324 we in fiji will decide what is in our national interest in the short and the long term outsiders cannot decide this for us
5370325 when two partners in business agree on everything one is unnecessary
5370326 i wanted flexibility and an in principle understanding that the date could be reviewed if fiji for good reason was not able to meet the particular date
5370327 that is why i have said that the most practical date for the general election under the new system cannot possibly be march 2009
5370328 it all depends on the soonest we can reach consensus on the implementation of the new electoral system at the presidents dialogue forum
5370329 it is more important for fiji to agree on a better way forward under the peoples charter than just having an election in march 09 under the current seriously flawed and undemocratic electoral system the pacific forum cannot decide for fiji on this issue
5370330 at the presidents dialogue forum we should agree to change the electoral system legally and constitutionally and in a broadly acceptable way that is supported by the majority of the people of fiji
5370331 the forum which is to be facilitated by the commonwealth secretariat and the united nations and which is to be parallel to an independent of the ncbbf provides opportunity for registered political parties to discuss the weaknesses of the current av and communal electoral system and the compelling reasons why it needs to be replaced
5370332 if some politicians keep looking to the past and their short term political interest in retaining the race based electoral system then they really should think seriously whether they should participate in the presidents dialogue forum
5370333 i have vacated the office with my resignation effective from tomorrow so all three members will not be in office tomorrow today
5370334 there has been much speculation about mr chaudhrys resignation i confirm that there was communication from me to him about resigning
5370335 however in the overall scheme of moving fiji forward this issue does not matter indeed this matter now should be put to rest given the decision made by the fiji labour party over the weekend that all its three members should resign
5370336 we must move away from petty politics we must show vision leadership and true statesmanship
5370337 the major work that had to be done is completed so i see no problem with him leaving
5370338 they have made their choice and all we can do is look forward to working with the new minister
5370339 we would like to see sweetbriar to the museum closed from 7 a m to 5 p m on weekends
5370340 the speed limits thirty five but we went out there with a radar gun we found the average to be 50 miles per hour and one hundred percent of the traffic was violating the limit there was no one going under thirty five
5370341 joshua always talks about how great they are but whats that saying you cant see the forest from the trees i thought i was only seeing the trees but apparently i have a magnificent and lush forest here
5370342 if the atoms never swerve so as to originate some new movement that will snap the bonds of fate the everlasting sequence of cause and effect what is the source of the free will possessed by living things throughout the earth
5370343 im still amazed that we can actually manage to prove that
5370344 its kind of depressing when people cant communicate with each other
5370345 we know thats true in politics but youd think that wouldnt be going on here
5370346 accept that the particles spin doesnt exist until its measured
5370347 this program is very exciting to us because it attracts brilliant young minds to our state
5370348 we believe ph d should no longer be an acronym for poor hungry and driven students have to put their lives completely on hold to further their education because todays doctoral studies take an average of five to six years to complete we want to reward the dedication and enthusiasm of these students by enabling them to focus entirely on their studies
5370349 with a maximum potential sponsorship of each fellow at 200 000 this is a significant investment for alltech
5370350 however we believe the backbone of the future is the education of our youth
5370351 we are thrilled to name anne koontz our very first alltech university of kentucky margin of excellence fellow
5370352 throughout her educational career she has demonstrated excellence in her work and enthusiasm for animal science she is a very talented young lady and we are proud to have her represent our margin of excellence program
5370353 the application is refused however the parties must be given further time to prepare for trial and the trial date is vacated a new trial date will be set with the concurrence of counsel
5370354 the remaining issues raised that the information is not supported by the evidence and that the first accused dhansukh bhika should not be required to give evidence in a related trial against another accused are misconceived
5370355 the question of sufficiency of evidence should be raised after the provision of the particulars promised by mr elliot dpp in a motion to quash information under section 275 of the criminal procedure code or in the course of submissions that there is no case for the accused to answer
5370356 mrs rigamoto 2000 cash and mr cokanasiga i hired a four wheel drive vehicle from asco motors this cokanasiga is the minister for home affairs
5370357 rigamoto approached me personally as for cokanasiga i was approached by ken cokanasiga
5370358 im not surprised and if you have not worked long enough with the fiji labour party and in particular its leader mahendra chaudhry you would recognise the kind of chary he plays i think this business of pulling out for somebody like me i would have told ages ago that at some point in the future chaudhry will distance himself from the regime
5370359 this has been the pattern getting close to people and using them for their efforts and talents and then discarding them whether its an individual or an institution
5370360 although there is a question mark whether the party had pulled him out or whether he did get told to pack up and go away that remains a questions mark until the military council volunteers to give out more information we are hearing rumours that thats what had been done and in fact that chaudhry had been given the marching orders
5370361 well again i am not surprised because the commander could go back on those words
5370362 so this would probably be one of those things that he will go back on or some new interpretation will be given to this we will get to hear from him bainimarama later
5370363 the scheme for 2000 and 2001 was mostly operated on the strength of a letter approved by agriculture without the lpo
5370364 they normally bring cheques for mhs or my company i normally give them 2000 to 3000 cash cheques
5370365 15 973 was paid to my company i did not agree to it that time but took it as a normal payment made to my company repina but now when i come to see the documents i agree it shouldnt have been paid to me
5370366 sakiusa bole directed the supply of goods when bole doesnt come his boys come to collect the goods and sign the delivery books which is normally with the security and for the invoices they are sent to agriculture for bole to sign before the payments are made
5370367 the original invoices were taken by the boys to be given to bole but it looks like it was never given
5370368 there are no documents to confirm the supply of goods because it was supposed to be signed by bole but bole didnt come only his boys came to pick up the delivery the only proof i have is the delivery invoice the delivery invoice was sighted and signed by the security at the gate
5370369 i dont have the copy of that delivery signed by that security because the original was signed by the boys at the gate has been taken by them only the book copy for the security came back to me in which i raised my invoices
5370370 the book copy was in the office which was destroyed when they cleared the office after i had left the company the day you nasir ali came to search my home i came back to search my office and checked on the book copy of the invoices but unfortunately i found my table cleaned out and all the documents gone
5370371 the scheme was getting bigger and more and more people came so he couldnt come so the boys came to collect the goods the original of the delivery was signed by the boys who came to collect the goods
5370372 sometimes the farmers come personally to collect the goods themselves and in order for me to have the proof that the goods were taken out the delivery book was left with the security
5370373 basing the delivery book copy i raised my company invoices and i later took it to agriculture main office and most times it is collected by suliasi sorovakatini when they come for lunch thats when they bring the cheques and at the same time collect the mhs and my company invoices
5370374 the farmers letters that were approved by agriculture and the lpo numbers which normally tell us where theyre from

5370538 its difficult to speculate on what coulda woulda shoulda happened but obviously having two fire stations closed definitely has an impact on our ability to respond to incidents
5370539 the cops were very heroic going in without that safety equipment they were very instrumental in helping to get quite a few people out
5370540 we as cops dont expect firemen to run into bank robberies and firemen dont expect police officers to run into burning buildings but when the publics life is in danger public safety people step forward
5370541 the performance of our fire department and police was great the response time was great and they saved a lot of people
5370542 the fire is estimated to be 80 percent contained and isolated to the abandoned housing area
5370543 so any earmark reductions we are seeing in august are likely to be negated by an avalanche of earmarks that always accompanies major omnibus spending bills
5370544 bono had the tracks playing on his stereo and people heard them outside but nobody expected them to be recorded
5370545 were not as concerned about it as we initially were
5370546 a great deal still depends on the decisions and good judgment of the next president
5370547 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5370548 all his bluster distortions and negative attacks notwithstanding it is hard to understand how senator mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5370549 the difference in this race is that john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5370550 first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5370551 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5370552 because he has the judgment vision and character to lead this country in the 21st century these veterans will play a prominent role in denver at the democratic national convention lead veterans for obama efforts in the states participate in grass roots fundraising efforts and serve as surrogates before veterans and general audiences across america
5370553 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5370554 today the shadow of dictatorship that has prevailed for long over this country that chapter has been closed
5370555 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5370556 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5370557 i pray the government stops this downward slide and takes the country out of this crisis
5370558 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual
5370559 that is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership
5370560 pakistan and the united states have a joint interest in fighting terror

5370594 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money

5370605 it was a great opportunity for us to play against a quality opponent
5370606 we started slow but really got it going later in the match
5370607 we had some good opportunities to score late in the game

5370610 we need our newer players to mesh quickly with the veterans
5370611 we may be a younger team now but what we have is a core group of veterans that is dissatisfied with how things finished the last two years we fell just short in several close matches and everyone in this program is very hungry to get back into the big ten race
5370612 this may be our best attacking team ever and its important that we get the most out of that
5370613 we had a stretch last year where we didnt score a lot of goals and i think we have the weapons to avoid that stretch this year however we need to be patient with each other while at the same time working together
5370614 i think lauren has matured a lot as a player since last year
5370615 she has become much better with her decision making she really came on this spring and her improvements will set her up to break out even more this season
5370616 she has unlimited potential and has matured what is nice for us is that cara and have really developed good chemistry up top and are playing at a really nice level
5370617 she will give us that spark when we need it we need her to be there for us as one of our seniors
5370618 she is a special kid knowing lauras character and the character of our upperclassmen they will all blend together quickly and nicely
5370619 sarah is one of the finest athletes we have ever recruited to michigan state
5370620 she is faster than the wind and an unbelievable jumper i expect her to make an impact as a freshman this fall
5370621 this is an area where well interchange a lot of players
5370622 well use defenders in the midfield and well even use forwards there
5370623 kristi is one of our best athletes and is one of the toughest players on our team
5370624 we want her to be a physical presence on the field for us as well as a team leader
5370625 lauren is a great talent and has the potential to be among the best attacking mids in the big ten but shes had a few injuries
5370626 she was on campus all summer working out and getting healthy if we can get a completely healthy megan brown and kate rehor also saw a lot of playing time last year and both figure to be in the midfield mix this season brown a very intelligent player appeared in all 19 matches in 2007 and had two assists is one of those players who always finds a way to contribute and shell be in line to compete for a starting spot
5370627 kate can play both midfield and defender and she gives us a physical presence on the field
5370628 hannah is great to have on the team she does everything she can to provide a spark for us
5370629 shes a good ball striker and she can really play anywhere in the attack for us
5370630 kelley and michelle give us the experience we need and i expect both of them to take leadership roles in the back for us
5370631 i have a lot of confidence in them because they know our system and are very complete players
5370632 she can still improve but she is currently our best option when matching up with the other teams best offensive threat
5370633 courtney didnt get much opportunity to play last season but in the spring she was in our starting lineup
5370634 i can see her starting in our early scrimmages and if she continues to develop shell be tough to take out of the match she is solid and has good attacking ability overall she reads the game very well and is a good player to have in the back
5370635 she is primarily an attacking left back but has played midfield and even forward in her career so shes very versatile
5370636 she is a special player and is a nice addition to our team
5370637 lindsey will enter the season as the number one goalkeeper

5370639 she is a tremendous competitor who is mentally strong she will bloom during her time at michigan state

5370689 i just dont understand the big deal sex sells those women just need to relax and enjoy it
5370690 if feminists want something to be upset about we should be upset about how title ix paints women as victims like affirmative action does for minorities
5370691 if you really believed in equality you would understand that the objectification of women is patently against the olympic ideal
5370692 and i would be happy to discuss the virtues of title ix victimization minorities and the implied subtext of your
5370693 i told my friends that i was going to go out with my son and they were impressed
5370694 it was i who used to have to read the menu when you were small
5370695 then its time that you relax and let me return the favor
5370696 the way it was explained to me is that muhammad was a very ordinary man he could not read didnt know how to write in fact he was an illiterate and were talking about 12 actually about 14 hundred years ago you have someone illiterate making profound pronouncements and statements and that are amazingly accurate about scientific nature and i personally cant see how this could be a mere chance there are too many accuracies and like dr moore i have no difficulty in my mind that this is a divine inspiration or revelation which led him to these statements
5370697 the quran describes not only the development of external form but emphasizes also the internal stages the stages inside the embryo of its creation and development emphasizing major events recognized by contemporary science
5370698 as a scientist i can only deal with things which i can specifically see i can understand embryology and developmental biology i can understand the words that are translated to me from the quran as i gave the example before if i were to transpose myself into that era knowing what i knew today and describing things i could not describe the things which were described i see no evidence for the fact to refute the concept that this individual muhammad had to be developing this information from some place so i see nothing here in conflict with the concept that divine intervention was involved in what he was able to write
5370699 i find it very interesting that this sort of information is in the ancient scriptures of the holy quran and i have no way of knowing where they would come from but i think it is extremely interesting that they are there and that this work is going on to discover it the meaning of some of the passages
5370700 well i would think it must be the divine being
5370701 he has let loosed the two seas the salt water and the sweet meeting together between them is a barrier which none of them can transgress
5370702 in a relatively few aayahs quranic verses is contained a rather comprehensive description of human development from the time of commingling of the organogenesis no such distinct and complete record of human development such as classification terminology and description existed previously in most if not all instances this description antedates by many centuries the recording of the various stages of human embryonic and fetal development recorded in the traditional scientific literature
5370703 i am very much impressed by finding true astronomical facts in the quran and for us the modern astronomers have been studying very small pieces of the universe weve concentrated our efforts for understanding of a very small part because by using telescopes we can see only very few parts of the sky without thinking about the whole universe so by reading the quran and by answering to the questions i think i can find my future way for investigation of the universe
5370704 and certainly we created man of an extract of clay then we made him a small seed in a firm resting place then we made the seed a clot then we made the clot a lump of flesh then we made in the lump of flesh bones then we clothed the bones with flesh then we caused it to grow into another creation so blessed be allah the best of the creators then after that you will most surely die then surely on the day of resurrection you shall be raised
5370705 this verse from the koran states that god made you from a drop and then changed the drop into a leech like structure which soon changed into a chewed like substance that then took the shape of bone and was clothed with flesh
5370706 i was amazed at the scientific accuracy of these statements which were made in the 7th century a d
5370707 the staging of human embryos was not proposed until the 1940s and the stages used nowadays were not adopted worldwide until a few years ago
5370708 someone 1400 years ago could not know the heavens and the earth had the same origin
5370709 thinking about many of these questions and thinking where muhammad came from he was after all a bedouin i think it is almost impossible that he could have known about things like the common origin of the universe because scientists have only found out within the last few years with very complicated and advanced technological methods that this is the case
5370710 somebody who did not know something about nuclear physics 1400 years ago could not i think be in a position to find out from his own mind for instance that the earth and the heavens had the same origin or many others of the questions that we have discussed here
5370711 that is a difficult question which i have been thinking about since our discussions here i am impressed at how remarkably some of the ancient writings seem to correspond to modern and recent astronomy i am not a sufficient scholar of human history to project myself completely and reliably into the circumstances that 1400 years ago would have prevailed
5370712 our knowledge of these disciplines is such that it is impossible to explain how a text produced at the time of the qur n could have contained ideas that have only been discovered in modern times
5370713 the above observation makes the hypothesis advanced by those who see mu h ammad as the author of the qur n untenable how could a man from being illiterate become the most important author in terms of literary merits in the whole of arabic literature how could he then pronounce truths of a scientific nature that no other human being could possibly have developed at that time and all this without once making the slightest error in his pronouncement on the subject
5370714 verily in the creation of the heavens and the earth and in the alternation of night and day and the ships which sail through the sea with that which is of use to mankind and the water rain which all h sends down from the sky and makes the earth alive therewith after its death and the moving living creatures of all kinds that he has scattered therein and in the veering of winds and clouds which are held between the sky and the earth are indeed ay t proofs evidences signs etc for people of understanding
5370715 do they not then think deeply in the qur n or are their hearts locked up from understanding it

5370718 nanotechnology research and development requires a highly collaborative and flexible approach to achieve commercially viable outcomes and that sentiment is very much alive here at oakland university
5370719 there is a rapidly growing nanotechnology corridor developing here in southeast michigan and we look forward to working with oakland university to access and enhance those resources
5370720 oakland university is very pleased to have been selected to collaborate with octillion on this exciting project
5370721 our interdisciplinary approach and relevant faculty expertise was a major attractor as was our commitment to supplement regional facilities such as the michigan nanofabrication facility with our laboratory equipment specific to the needs of octillion
5370722 this agreement with an institution known for its exceptional ability to work with commercial partners further positions octillion as a dedicated player in the michigan economy and may soon enable organic expansion in the nanotech and solar portion of our growing technology portfolio
5370723 as we continue to develop transparent solar photovoltaics that can be readily integrated into the existing glass manufacturing infrastructure i believe dr qus specific expertise and the flexible nature of our contract will substantially increase the potential value of our research to octillions shareholders

5370733 we are not in the same situation as the firms who are offering to buy securities they issued or underwrote back from customers to whom they sold them
5370734 many securities firms have been asked by regulators to provide information regarding these securities we are one of those firms and are cooperating with these requests
5370735 its important to know that unlike other firms that have been in the news related to auction rate securities we didnt underwrite these products didnt market them to our clients but simply acted as an agent as an accommodation when clients asked for them a significant portion were simply transferred in from other firms where they were originally purchased
5370736 in the days when the audience is shrinking you have to grow your business
5370737 not just our logo with the box scores but some interactivity to it
5370738 we have discussed it internally but so far we have resisted
5370739 theres a dancing act going on internally with advertising trying to figure out an appropriate way not to hurt the viewing experience
5370740 the shopping cart had the logo but it didnt say target or shop tomorrow
5370741 they wanted it to be subtle and thats why we went with it because it didnt seem to distract
5370742 we are trying to remove clutter to make sure viewers have the best possible experience if we start placing ads we will lose the value of promotions as a navigation tool
5370743 when we hit on the right program and marry it with the right ad it could happen but its not on the docket right now
5370744 i understand the networks are trying to monetize content and advertisers want their message to be seen but no one ever seems to think about the viewer
5370745 it detracts from the program theyre covering part of the screen
5370746 i think even if people are watching a national weather warning they dont like losing part of their screen to things that have nothing to do with the show
5370747 it appears that on average 10 of information delivered in the visually complex condition did not get through to long term memory due to visual complexity
5370748 there is no explanation that justifies using a presentational format for news that makes it more difficult for viewers than it already is the data strongly suggest that the format harms story fact comprehension thus this cacophonous format appears to be one that can and should be better managed by television news producers
5370749 cognitive theory shows that people cant take in two messages they go back and forth
5370750 you are not taking away from the emotional engagement some networks put them in the middle of the action some at the end of the segment the problem is we dont know how to measure pushback is it when ratings go down we dont know where the boundary is until we cross it
5370751 you have to factor in duration is it an icon is it a link to information how impactful is it how prominent what show is it on the disadvantage is that you are in competition with the content of the program
5370752 people are requesting kids premiums that are more socially responsible
5370753 parents want variety healthy options and a fun toy to occupy kids time
5370754 fast food restaurants want to put on a better face in the community
5370755 just as you wouldnt expect to see a tobacco ad on a kids site or show there shouldnt be junk food ads there either
5370756 while there are some rules for tv there are no rules when you move online
5370757 we dont want to reduce junk food advertising to kids on tv and then find that it has just moved to another platform
5370758 with social networking marketers are getting the kids to create the ads and share them with their friends
5370759 it is incredibly sticky and it is viral regulators need to understand that
5370760 the report finds that although there is room for improvement the food and beverage industries have made significant progress
5370761 the cost of reaching and engaging a lot more kids is a lot less than the cost of what it is to buy a 30 second television ad
5370762 they are using a powerful arsenal of tools to target children and adolescents so they can engage in these unhealthy eating behaviors
5370763 to show that the government needs to regulate this advertising to improve childrens diets would be pretty tough
5370764 we think that companies can act on a self regulatory basis much more quickly than the government can
5370765 listen up fellow parents when we point a collective finger three more are pointing right back at us

5370834 my goal for every play for every game is to run the offense and put the ball in the right spot to the right receiver

5370991 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5370992 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5370993 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5370994 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5370995 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5370996 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes

5371000 although liu doesnt go out often whenever he does he sees his own picture in the streets and then whenever he surfs the internet he sees all kinds of information about him

5371012 the governor and his team have not given us the numbers needed for us to start making decisions

5371014 weve got a situation now where the state of virginias budget is bleeding and the governor is standing there saying oh my weve got to figure out which artery got cut

5371235 he wants to challenge the old firm and although we have only played two games i do not see why we cannot do that
5371236 it gives the fringe players a good chance to get in there and perhaps leave the manager with something to think about with the qualifier to come in three weeks
5371237 i love playing for my country it is the highlight of any players career it would be great to start but that is the managers decision
5371238 the fact we are playing one of the home nations in scotland makes it special as well and something i would love to be part of

5371277 we believe that the obsession with idealized beauty and body image is a lifelong burden that takes a terrible toll on all young girls and women in this country
5371278 whats really new here is the sheer extent to which women and girls are now willing to go literally causing physical harm to be beautiful according to the standards perpetuated by a youth obsessed media culture with literally thousands of messages 24 hours a day

5371287 you can save money and save the environment by driving green
5371288 through ecodriving 10 top automakers and the states of california and colorado have found we share an important commitment and we commend governor schwarzenegger and governor ritter for their leadership in engaging consumers in green driving drivers dont have to wait to buy a new fuel efficient vehicle to start reducing fuel costs and co2 though i do encourage everyone to buy one of our new fuel efficient vehicles immediately
5371289 todays automobiles are really computers on wheels with more than 3 000 interactive parts operating as a complex system the more you know about your machine the better you can reduce fuel use and co2 emissions
5371290 consumers who are better aware of the operations of their vehicle will be rewarded by saving money at the gas pump and reducing co2 emissions working together we can substantially reduce co2 emissions and fuel use one ecodriver at a time
5371291 were all in this together so theres a role for each one of us to play in being a part of the solution to these critical issues
5371292 automakers are aggressively developing and introducing new technologies but it takes 15 years or more for these technologies to become widespread on the road ecodriving helps consumers reduce carbon dioxide emissions today

5371298 the opportunity for synergy between sears and ll cool j has been phenomenal
5371299 it stems in large part from the authenticity of the campaign sears was a fixture in his life from the time he was a child he is committed to bringing that same relevance to families today the fact that ll cool j appeared on mark seligers first rolling stone cover and that mark is the mastermind behind this seasons visuals adds another dimension of genuineness these are real beginnings in an icons career that has spanned more than two decades they underscore the aspirational nature of the brand while maintaining ll cool js approachability to our customers

5371336 our group has been working on understanding heparin biosynthesis for almost 30 years
5371337 we are working on what might be the next generation of heparin production with no animal source
5371338 we treat it to reduce the molecular size then subject it to enzymatic steps to convert it to heparin
5371339 we use recombinant enzymes that are part of the natural pathway for heparin synthesis
5371340 we are now working with one liter amounts there are million liter fermenters we have to scale up three orders of magnitude which is pretty daunting but not impossible
5371341 we have talked to a number of them they all are interested in the approach but want to wait
5371342 but those drugs are a thousand times more expensive than heparin also they are not as good as heparin it has multiple activities many of which benefit patients those drugs are very specific they work well only for a small number of applications

5371537 i hope they hurry up and find a cure quick
5371538 i passed the test its actually quite hard to fail i think
5371539 we had what i called a clapham junction day when you know the phones were ringing there were lots of things to do and i was just kind of flat lining almost i just couldnt deal with it and i thought theres more theres more
5371540 its unusual because people deal with me and they refuse to believe i have alzheimers because at the moment i can speak very coherently i can plot a novel
5371541 i type badly if it wasnt for my loss of typing ability i might doubt the fact that i have alzheimers
5371542 its now hunt and peck and there will be a moment sometimes when the letter a just totally vanishes and i dont quite know what happens
5371543 its as if the keyboard closes up and the letter a is not there anymore then ill blink a few times and then the letter a comes back
5371544 the basic test for example will ask you questions like what day of the week is it what is the date i have a pa so there are really only two types of day is my pa in or is my pa out what day of the week is it well if hes not here then its probably the weekend
5371545 one of the questions was how many animals can you name
5371546 my wife said you would pick up the shirt and look at it as if you were looking at some kind of new thing that you had to wear and now you just put it on and just do the buttons up and you dont think about it
5371547 one piece of advice i was given by a specialist was surround yourself with toys he didnt mean buy stuff but try to make your life as interesting as possible keep yourself active keep yourself interested
5371548 my fans across the world started to contact me and in fact the website fell over and it was just getting ridiculous so i sent out a message saying its only worth asking me if you can help if youre a high end brain specialist
5371549 about a dozen or more contacted me saying i dont know about high end but im head of the department of whatever at so and so university

5371558 the long island express and the recent flooding across the midwest are grim reminders of the large scale devastation that floods can cause
5371559 these events also underscore the fact that everyone is at risk for flooding the best way to have financial protection and peace of mind is with a flood insurance policy flood insurance is widely available and should be part of your insurance portfolio whether you live in a high or low to moderate risk area
5371560 residents and business owners need to prepare early to avoid taking a big risk
5371561 if a storm similar to the long island express were to strike the northeast today it would cause multiple feet of flood waters in minutes and inestimable damage to homes business and infrastructure

5371605 this new national center will help move schools universities and training facilities nationwide into the 21st century
5371606 americas reputation as an international leader rests in the hands of our youth and it should be among our top priorities to provide our students with the tools they need to maintain and build upon this standing
5371607 the national center will help future american workers compete in the global marketplace
5371608 the national center couldnt come at a more critical time
5371609 american businesses know that they need a well educated workforce to face growing competition from china india and europe
5371610 americans need to constantly upgrade their skills to keep pace with technology and international competition and people who are losing their jobs often need to acquire new skills to rejoin the work force
5371611 this initiative is built on historical precedents once each century during a time of national crisis our country has made a transformative investment in education the northwest ordinance brought public education in the 18th century the land grant colleges act brought public higher education in the 19th century and the gi bill of the 20th century creating the national center will bring learning and skills training into the 21st century
5371612 for the first time education research will benefit from the kinds of creative research management that has been so effective in driving innovation in other parts of the economy it will be able to focus research talent across the nation in many fields and many institutions on one of the nations most pressing problems

5371614 its awesome to be in a program that faces some of the best programs in the country and some of the best players in the country
5371615 my biggest talks and dealings with darrell have more to do with him understanding a quality balance of life and what it takes to be successful
5371616 his game will come around at some point whether thats day one or week one or year two i dont know i know that it will come at some point but my biggest push for him is just all the intangible factors
5371617 i dont think it matters even if you have veteran guys i really dont
5371618 there are a tremendous amount of good players in our conference and so were going to have to do a lot of things that starts up front and mixing things up and changing things up and giving people on the back end a chance i dont think it matters whether youre veterans or rookies youre going to have some problems with the talent we have in the league
5371619 theres not a coach that does this and youre aware of this that isnt extremely passionate about what he does
5371620 but knowing that the way that the big 12 south schedule is going to rotate around to us the teams that weve played in the last two years have been a couple of the more young teams like ourselves
5371621 now were going to play some of the more veteran teams liketexas tech and oklahoma and texas a amp m they have a tremendous number of veteran players
5371622 all those programs have done a terrific job recruiting we knew coming into year three that wed have quite a test going down to the south to play that part of the schedule
5371623 he freeman is one of the very few quarterbacks in the country thats never red shirted
5371624 this is one of the few quarterbacks in the country that came in from high school right into our program was expected to play and win
5371625 and i think from there its just been a matter of trying to put the kind of talent around him at some of the skill positions but really we didnt feel that he was going to realize any of this talent either until he had an offensive line that could protect him and have a complementary running game or at least a running game that could dictate the terms
5371626 if you go back to 2007 we had a lot of ups and a lot of downs
5371627 and i think we saw some improvement at the end of the year in our football team
5371628 so our last eight months have been very driven to erase a 3 9 year and to show progress
5371629 i would say theres just great parity in the league period
5371630 and this league has become one of the elite leagues if not the elite league in the country
5371631 im very excited about this team and the opportunities we have this year we have a chance to accomplish some great things but i can tell you well be in a whole bunch of close football games just like we were last year and were going to have to win all of them
5371632 our kids walk onto the field and expect to win we expect to win championships we want to be conference usa champions and bowl champions and thats high expectations especially from where we were six years ago
5371633 the key on our football team this year is quarterback and linebacker because thats where we lost two of our better leaders and players
5371634 were in our second year of the system so our guys are so much farther along at understanding the blocking schemes and understanding the schematics of our run pass game
5371635 we think david is very consistent and hes a guy that we really trust jacob is an unbelievable talent with his arm strength and ability to run we have great talent at quarterback with those two guys
5371636 our quarterback will have to manage the game and not turn over the football operate the offense and distribute the ball to the multitude of talented guys we have on the offensive side of the ball
5371637 we dont look to miss a beat offensively the key to our offensive productivity will be the quarterback position
5371638 we think that we have one of the top running back corps in the nation with tarrion adams and courtney tennial leading the way
5371639 i really believe we have a top five receiving corps in the country our receiving corps is a definite strength for our team we have a very explosive and fast group of guys
5371640 well have a big strong offensive line and i think it will be the best line weve had since ive been associated with the program they have experience under their belt that helps tremendously so were excited about the offensive front
5371641 justin morsey and rod thomas are the two most under rated offensive linemen in our conference they combine to form a very good right side of the line
5371642 its tremendous ive been riding in the canadian team for 39 years but the olympics have never quite gone my way and so this is a remarkable thing
5371643 you do it long enough it gets a little numb and you know very well that youve really got to control things
5371644 hace unos d as observamos a un hombre sospechoso en la puerta del banco naci n en caz n y mitre en el centro de tigre el polic a que estaba en la sala de visualizaci n llam a la comisar a y se logr evitar una salidera el hombre estaba armado y ten a dos pedidos de captura

5371849 the women pulled back from me as if id said i eat babies i felt such shame and remorse and humiliation and i guess thats exactly what they wanted for my character lynette
5371850 id just left two screaming kids in the bathtub and it was raining
5371851 we actually just tried somebody a nanny out last week it was her first day because im going back to work to do a film later in the year so were trying to find somebody but weve been doing it by ourselves and we love it
5371852 i feel so bad these guys the dancers came in for a good cause to help out and its not starting out so good its more emotional because there are so many memories
5371853 i was just 13 when one of my best friends brothers was about to sign a contract with london football team leyton orient
5371854 but one day he was walking the streets saw a fight went over to help got stabbed in the back and was paralysed
5371855 no one wants to see the devastation i saw my friend and his family go through we have to lend our support to this campaign you dont expect situations that are happening whereby people go to school in the morning and then you never see them again because of incidents that have happened
5371856 we have got to help we have got a voice that kids listen to so it is important we get involved in something like this
5371857 youve got to start slow and give yourself time this is not something that is natural to me but its something that is a challenge and im always into challenging myself and seeing what i can do you have to start little by little and you just work up to it
5371858 the swimming is a killer im not going to lie im not a natural swimmer its very foreign im a good athlete i feel like my stamina i can get it up there if i work really hard but the swimming the swimming is a killer olympic swimmer michael phelps he has nothing on me
5371859 the first thing that he will do when he returns home is to focus on his health since he is fairly old
5371860 is your enemy the man who has made your life miserable who is working to destroy you the man who has been trying to kill you day after day throughout this war
5371861 ive asked you twice for a coffee go and get it now or ill kick you
5371862 obecnie trwaj bardzo zaawansowane negocjacje dotycz ce zakupu nieruchomo ci a ich zako czenie i realizacja tego kontraktu przewidywana jest jeszcze w tym miesi cu
5371863 wow just look at the time sorry id like to stay here longer so that you guys can continue to stomp a mud hole in my ass but gee my supper is getting cold
5371864 you should rather be hated for what you are than loved for what you are not
5371865 they hit her and hit her and hit and the police sergeant stood there and did nothing
5371866 they were slamming her against the post and then slamming the gate on her
5371867 and the police officer did nothing to protect her the cop literally walked away while she was still being pushed around
5371868 they said she could leave but no one could come in
5371869 placed the king of hawaii and his kingdom under federal protective custody and arrested the state of hawaii from doing anything that would harm or endanger the kingdom or threaten the treaties of the usa by armed force
5371870 we are continuing our investigation into what happened and no further comment would be appropriate at this time
5371871 until it is possible for us to assess any damage and to ensure the palace doors are secure we regret that we are unable to share the palace with visitors until the assessment is complete
5371872 its always a balance between having access for the public because it belongs to the public but also protecting it
5371873 i plan it i know i can take it over with the help of god i will take it over
5371874 everybody when theyre young they do a lot of mistakes your parents say not to do that you still do that i got plenty of charges yes
5371875 we are delighted to receive this level of support from the biotechnology center
5371876 it will greatly assist us in acquiring some essential equipment as well as support our research efforts these programs from ncbc are of great value to early stage companies such as ours allowing us to stretch our funding dollars and giving us the additional time that is so critical to meeting milestones and raising the next round of financing
5371877 watching the behaviour of young israeli soldiers towards an elderly palestinian man on my first day in jerusalem at a checkpoint felt very familiar
5371878 id seen this in south africa where i grew up
5371879 ive always been a doctor interested in human rights and wider questions and you could say that doctors have as much a responsibility to speak out about the social and political causes of distress and disease as they have to treat the individual patients
5371880 in a bad state though not remotely as bad as it is now
5371881 i was in gaza on the day the so called peace process was signed in oslo in august 1993 and it was very interesting because most of the people i knew there were incredibly happy they thought it was the end of it all but a minority of palestinians said and they turned out to be right this wasnt a deal and were pessimistic and that yasser arafat didnt know what he was signing
5371882 the most awful crime has been played out down there by a colonial power that considered itself part of europe they were grabbing palestinians land and torturing them in ways that were reminiscent of south africa but as it turns out far far worse than south africa
5371883 much more openly brutal and the major powers didnt say anything
5371884 when before they went on a raid the israeli defence board used to discuss how it would look in europe and the us they dont bother with that any more so clearly torture was a major question there
5371885 basically spent some time in israeli detention some of them for years
5371886 all of which pointed to consistent torture as state policy in israel and the appalling use of indiscriminate fire power against children who throw stones
5371887 close range by snipers a single bullet to the head or neck
5371888 they should not condone or be present during torture and they should speak out if they come across it
5371889 the israeli medical association is a signatory to these declarations yet it became clear that it was in complete complicity in the war crimes committed by the israeli state
5371890 more unarmed palestinian civilians since september 2000 than the number of people who died on 11 september 2001
5371891 i dont cite my opinion i quote international rights groups and un bodies the facts are there already
5371892 im called that all the time it doesnt inhibit me if anything it encourages me because it means im getting through to them so they make a fight but the point about a fight is that it creates more publicity and its conscientising it wakes up people one way or the other and part of the story here is when is the doctor a doctor that is to say its a humanitarian profession supposedly it has a moral authority in a society healing people regardless of politics and when is a doctor a citizen this is another matter altogether and what ive discovered is that at the end of the day israeli doctors have made it clear their loyalty is to israeli citizenship and if israel says they must torture palestinians and shoot children in the street then those doctors will do their best to cover it up or make it sound ok to put a nice face on it theyre putting a nice face on the occupation
5371893 which makes the question are you a citizen or a doctor more poignant
5371894 the head of the ima who is in charge of medical ethics knows that doctors have a duty to speak out against torture but he said to them come on whats a couple of broken fingers when you interrogate a palestinian man for the information we can get
5371895 these are academics so they have a certain public status
5371896 of course its difficult to run it and there are tremendous pressures but were optimistic
5371897 brings out whats happening and the point is the collusion of the academic establishment in israel not one israeli university protested when palestinian universities were shut berzeit university was shut for three years at one point students are shot at check points they cant get to lectures doctors cant get to see patients nothing some israeli universities are now founded on palestinian land stolen land academia especially medical academia is in complete collusion with the colonial expansionist state
5371898 we try to get aid in to gaza teach in universities in palestine and we give palestinian students places to study in britain
5371899 an israeli doctor will applaud me and buy me a drink if i write about sudan guatemala or china if i were to cross out israel and put sudan that would be great but because i say its israel they say to me youre a pro terrorist propagandist or they call me nazi in psychology we say we have many rooms in our head and one has to ask which one are you in and speaking from in some of our rooms we dont behave the same the fact is that ive been consistently bold on israel and they tell me there must be some weird reason why i am an anti semite
5371900 support for israel is embedded in western systems without doubt the us and the uk regard israel as a european country israel continues to play the holocaust story and anti semitism as a way of blocking the truth
5371901 its a much harder struggle than the struggle against apartheid so none of us fools ourselves but i think weve had some modest effects and i think they continue israel certainly has taken them extremely seriously every time an israeli cabinet minister comes to london the first thing he wants to talk about is the boycott what they fear is the rhetorical power that these things echo thats what theyre afraid of
5371902 ultimately what would be effective would be not buying israeli goods and trying to get companies to take their investments out of israeli linked companies
5371903 of course its terribly slow and of course most people are not political
5371904 clearly we have to influence the politicians but out of 550 mps in britain more than 200 were drawn in as friends of israel and their concern is to block these things to hide it it is extraordinary how strong the lobby is
5371905 do you realise you have more power to do good in the world if three or four jewish professors who have connections with the ima say that involvement of israeli doctors in interrogation rooms has to stop the torture will have to stop because then shabak the general security services wouldnt be able to proceed in their usual way i tell them that not doing this is moral corruption
5371906 and bring closure to any remaining family and let people know we never give up
5371907 people in there are going to court they want to have a cigarette their nerves be shot
5371908 there are some attorneys who smoke in the building and who have some concerns about having a place where they can smoke in the building and where their clients can smoke
5371909 i think employees now have an expectation that they work in a smoke free environment
5371910 i need someone to help me with housing and food for the children we cant cope with this by ourselves
5371911 we already have three girls she wanted a boy i told her because of our standard of life three are enough we were barely coping with three children
5371912 we didnt expect it she took the right dosage its true drugs can cause twins but not this many children he said
5371913 she might be able to suckle twins but not this many
5371914 there were offers from people as far away as kuwait and from the health ministry but nothing yet
5371915 we know we are more than just neurons firing or at least we think we are while the neurons are firing

5371922 the afl cio and three other labor rights groups have asked the federal election commission fec to investigate whether wal mart stores inc unlawfully pressured employees to vote against democrats in november because their party would help workers to unionize
5371923 wal mart broke federal election rules by advocating against democratic candidate u s sen barack obama in meetings with employees
5371924 federal election rules allow businesses to push for specific political candidates to shareholders executives and salaried managers but they prohibit such actions for hourly workers

5371989 mifos addresses one of the most fundamental barriers to sustainable growth for the microfinance industry limited access to affordable flexible and scalable information technology solutions that microfinance institutions can adapt as their needs evolve
5371990 by pioneering a new approach to technology mifos empowers microfinance giving practitioners equal access to a system they not only benefit from but contribute to and own
5371991 we looked at off the shelf products and even considered having someone build a customized system for us
5371992 but we didnt want to reinvent the wheel mifos gives us control of the development of our system and we are not at the mercy of any particular technology provider
5371993 omidyar network is committed to advancing technologies that will benefit and transform the entire microfinance industry
5371994 since 2004 we have supported grameen foundations efforts to promote the evolution of microfinance and are particularly pleased to support the mifos initiative with its open source platform and strong focus on building local it expertise mifos offers the industry a strong sustainable technology platform which is critical for the industry if it is to evolve and expand its outreach
5371995 this is a truly extraordinary opportunity for goldman sachs people to work with a global community of it and microfinance professionals committed to ending poverty
5371996 we are excited to collaborate with grameen foundation on the mifos initiative which we believe will be critical in helping the microfinance industry advance by improving loan portfolio management customer data analytics and access to capital markets
5371997 there were many regulations to comply with and the license comes with a number of restrictions too
5371998 we have shortlisted the morning and evening slots because these are the times we might be able to reach a mass audience however looking at the response we might decide to go on air full day on weekends
5371999 the stations are to be manned by an inexperienced staff as we dont have anyone with a radio background also we have to face competition from the already existing air channels and television its a challenge to divert the audience to listen to community radio
5372000 community radio acts as a platform for common people to express their views and opinions and plays an important role in the development of the community
5372001 we wanted a first hand physical experience that would make this more real to us so that we can make it more real for others
5372002 to meet the people to visit their communities to see the schools to witness the transformation that is taking place and to be able to say i have been i have seen and i have my own stories to tell
5372003 i am sure we will learn a lot about perseverance and team work this is a chance to literally grow closer to god
5372004 we expect themes of conferences to impact on the lives of christians as they grow into maturity spiritually morally mentally socially financially physically and politically
5372005 let us go on to maturity how to please god
5372006 we are convinced that there is a price to pay to grow and commitment is the price he added
5372007 the fellowship had once suffered a jolt growing unto maturity is the clarion call let us together rise up to the occasion for though our strength appears unequal to the task our effort would make the church great and please god
5372008 in this wise we would be praising the great and famous men who once sacrificed their material and human resources to build edifices for gods glory

5372017 they demand the dismissal of the government but we are not bothered
5372018 but subject cut offs have been used only as a filtering criteria and these are not the minimum marks of candidates admitted its the aggregate marks that are used for ranking subject cut offs dont make any difference in the final list analysis has shown whatever be the subject cut off theres not much difference up to top 20
5372019 to take in so many reserved category students admission criteria will have to be relaxed
5372020 nearly 50 of the reserved seats remain vacant as sc st students are unable to secure the minimum threshold marks two thirds of the last candidate admitted in the general category of those admitted almost 25 are asked to leave due to poor performance
5372021 the drop in cut offs is significant one reason could be that the iits took in more students but there are other concerns the jee is outdated for one also the quality of quota candidates admitted is being compromised as more students need to be taken in
5372022 we have drinking water pipelines in our village and most of the villagers fetch water from the water tapes but for dalits there is a separate water tap which is being blocked many time also we are allowed to take water only when others have got enough to quench their thirst
5372023 just a month ago during my daughters marriage i had to purchase water from a private supplier as i did not get sufficient water from village
5372024 villagers have to rely only on government for their drinking water needs as ground water is extremely saline here but we often prefer drinking the saline water or have to go at least 2 km to fetch drinking water also if there is water in a well dalits have to wait for other villagers as we cant touch their wells

5372052 how many other women in your bridge club own a car like this
5372053 you do not feel uncomfortable because you make more money than the road
5372054 you dont stand in front of a mirror before a run and wonder what the road will think of your outfit
5372055 plus we arent as likely to hook a dress or coat under the handle and tear it
5372056 you can call on the rode whenever you feel like it whether its been a day or even a couple of hours since your last date the only thing that the rode cares about is that you pay it a visit every once in a while
5372057 sure if she is with her husband you wouldnt be able to give her quite as much attention as if she were alone
5372058 we will also begin running the preparatory course at the six new iits from this year
5372059 out of 159 seats reserved for sc st students only 10 sc category students got admission to the btech course
5372060 hence they are trained for a year before they are inculcated into the full time programme
5372061 only after completing the training some of them would they be inducted into the first year btech course for the academic session 2008 2009
5372062 it is hard to believe that there is a dearth of talent among tribal students the vacancies of reserved seats in the iits were probably created because something went wrong somewhere
5372063 however after we intervened and told the state to rectify the process of selection the medical colleges increased up to 38 in 2007 also 87 others qualified for medical colleges out of the state
5372064 experts and the authorities are deliberating the situation in the ministry
5372065 we have lot of things to say but can we
5372066 its sad that government is not understanding the situation in the iit system the best teachers should get a chance to mould students into leaders there is no feeling of any social strata in the iits
5372067 the only consideration is talent and lets not dilute it
5372068 we have to think about affirmative action and craft it in such a way where some of our children who are advantaged arent getting more favorable treatment than a poor white kid who has struggled more
5372069 we have to have these conversations about race and class
5372070 everybody is nervous that in a political campaign we get reduced to slogans and the narrowest of slogans so that you dont get good discussions
5372071 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
5372072 obviously concerned about whether this is a retreat from a commitment to affirmative action in its classical sense
5372073 daughters are not going to be judged in a colorblind way throughout their lives
5372074 his work was with those who didnt have much and they were black hispanic and white
5372075 he never had much inclination to use affirmative action as a tool then he wanted to level the playing field by providing early childhood education programs access to good schools
5372076 he was clearly unambiguously in favor of affirmative action as a policy matter but he recognized some of the ambiguities and the nuances in the argument that the most passionate affirmative action supporters often did not
5372077 but subject cut offs have been used only as a filtering criteria and these are not the minimum marks of candidates admitted its the aggregate marks that are used for ranking subject cut offs dont make any difference in the final list analysis has shown whatever be the subject cut off theres not much difference up to top 20
5372078 to take in so many reserved category students admission criteria will have to be relaxed
5372079 nearly 50 of the reserved seats remain vacant as sc st students are unable to secure the minimum threshold marks two thirds of the last candidate admitted in the general category of those admitted almost 25 are asked to leave due to poor performance
5372080 the drop in cut offs is significant one reason could be that the iits took in more students but there are other concerns the jee is outdated for one also the quality of quota candidates admitted is being compromised as more students need to be taken in
5372081 because it has not been implemented properly wherever it has been applied
5372082 i work for an ngo and we give the poor opportunity to learn so that they can compete for competitive jobs
5372083 it is not a law but an understanding between the government and the investors and it is total volunatary
5372084 but at the same time they are free not to introduce reservation
5372085 whoever not being a member of a scheduled caste or a scheduled tribe xi assaults or uses force to any woman belonging to a scheduled caste or a scheduled tribe with the intent to dishonor or outrage her modesty xii being in a position to dominate the will of a woman belonging to a scheduled caste or a scheduled tribe and uses that position to exploit her sexually to which she would not have otherwise agreed shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than six months but which may extend to five years and with fine
5372086 it shall be the duty of the employer or other responsible persons in work places or other institutions to prevent or deter the commission of acts of sexual harassment and to provide the procedures for the resolution settlement or prosecution of acts of sexual harassment by taking all steps required
5372087 its absolutely horrendous and so callous and so cavalier of these planners to not take into account the 40 people that it affects
5372088 certainly not in the short term because the current market is not encouraging redevelopment
5372089 and i dont think anyones going to want to come in and take that risk at the moment
5372090 how long does it take on the average to finish a building
5372091 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function
5372092 president medvedev is liar russian troops are in georgia they kill ppl and say that georgians are agressors but now every normal ppl see that russians are agressors russia is rival for all the world shame russia here in georgia is genocide russians kill georgian ppl

5372110 man im lying on the ground she hates me oh god i wanna die
5372111 moms are the decision makers of the household as far as purchases are concerned
5372112 so much of what weve read has been negative this was the first positive story weve heard
5372113 and has given some indication that he intends to commit suicide in the plane
5372114 his only response was that he wanted to hang out there which was not a very compelling reason
5372115 its a very strong squad on paper and now we need to deliver a performance which indicates that strength
5372116 it is obviously disappointing not to be selected and you want to be playing for your country but if mr capello doesnt put you in the squad then we have to go out and prove him wrong
5372117 mr capello does come to villa quite a lot and i am not going to give up
5372118 but i want to play for my country ive played for the under 21s and i want to be in the full squad i want to get on the pitch and play and hopefully i can do that
5372119 but as soon as the squad is picked and if youre in the under 21 side you should be ready to roll your sleeves up and think i must do well in this squad
5372120 we value the initiatives of local communities to provide sustainable buildings and facilities that mean people want to remain there
5372121 by excluding those who have already attained economic well being or educational advancement the special benefits cannot be further extended to them and if done so it would be unreasonable discriminatory or arbitrary resulting in reverse discrimination
5372122 all the leaders who work for social justice should work together to defeat the creamy layer concept
5372123 the net result of job reservation for the other backward classes over
5372124 if you think reservations are bad why dont you travel in the general compartment in trains
5372125 why are reservations good the moment you can buy them
5372126 twice born hindus dwijas comprising brahmins kayasthas rajputs vaishyas and khatris account for about 16 per cent of indias population but they are about 86 per cent among the key media decision makers brahmins alone constitute 49 per cent of the key media personnel
5372127 because it has not been implemented properly wherever it has been applied
5372128 i work for an ngo and we give the poor opportunity to learn so that they can compete for competitive jobs
5372129 it is not a law but an understanding between the government and the investors and it is total volunatary
5372130 but at the same time they are free not to introduce reservation
5372131 conversion is a rejection of whatever caste stands for it is a great walkout from hinduism
5372132 reservation exists in many well known universities in india including those in tamil nadu such as anna bharathidasan and tiruchi universities yet the quality or prestige of these universities has not been vitiated
5372133 the interests of other communities especially the economically weaker sections among the upper castes
5372134 children in karnataka are taught from the very beginning that reservation is very much part of the social justice system so they learn to live with it
5372135 we have to have an inclusive society the iims cant become islands for the privileged if this quota system is crude let educationalists re engineer and restructure it
5372136 it is because of reservation people like me could make a mark
5372137 reservation existed in many well known universities in india including those in tamil nadu such as anna bharathidasan and tiruchi universities and osmania and andhra universities in andhra pradesh yet the quality or prestige of these universities has not been vitiated
5372138 assuming that 5 000 students were to be admitted to the iits every year and 27 per cent reservation was made for students belonging to obcs it would work out to 1 350 seats for the obcs the number of iit aspirants from the obc communities is about one lakh you cannot say that out of this 1 00 000 there will not be 1 350 candidates competent enough to get into the iits
5372139 in fact my experience as the vice chancellor of anna university showed that those who come under the reserved category tend to put an extra effort to perform better because they think that this is a rare opportunity for their upward social mobility and economic security
5372140 this is an absolutely gratuitous term of reference which fails to understand real merit
5372141 in a way it is all because of reservation after all if the economy does well whom do you sell your products to it has to be to dalits obcs and minorities only after the blacks were given equal opportunities did the american economy witness a boom you have to make the deprived sections share power and become partners in progress
5372142 the state governments by insisting that the medium of instruction should be in the mother tongue confines the students to a local world later they are not able to communicate they might have a degree but no employment
5372143 with people devising so many ways to earn money the sense of social deprivation is not proportionate to the economic deprivation we have been able to deny public distribution system benefits to those above the poverty line but we have not been able to devise a foolproof method to remove creamy layer obcs from the reservation list
5372144 there are 20 muslim communities on the obc list in gujarat but they find it difficult to get even certificates from the bureaucracy
5372145 the social reform movement and the demands for reservation in these areas especially in the southern states had come up along with a general reform movement and the national liberation movement in the late 19th century and the early 20th century it was a period of democratic aspirations and social churning and one could see reform movements of all communities helping one another the leaders of the brahmin reform movement supported those who advocated reforms among obcs and both joined hands to lend a voice of solidarity to those who led a reform movement in the muslim community
5372146 the competition for jobs is intense and many think that reservation divests their opportunities little realising the negative impact of historical social subjugation and oppression of the disadvantaged sections and the need to rectify such negative impact
5372147 oh dont you know the cardinal rule but its worth it all this strife you see i began as sediment sitting in a stream i was never happy and often wept in remorse i knew this was the end my doom had come upon me because pressure makes diamonds you see
5372148 we will also begin running the preparatory course at the six new iits from this year
5372149 we have been once again cheated by dead deities and false ornaments we were cheated socially and politically now we are being cheated in the name of god
5372150 i have assured the administration ill complete the statues in record time
5372151 that is why i got the first statue of my mentor kanshi ram installed in lucknow during his lifetime but because he wished that i should also have my own statue next to his i decided to put mine too
5372152 out of 159 seats reserved for sc st students only 10 sc category students got admission to the btech course
5372153 hence they are trained for a year before they are inculcated into the full time programme
5372154 only after completing the training some of them would they be inducted into the first year btech course for the academic session 2008 2009
5372155 it is hard to believe that there is a dearth of talent among tribal students the vacancies of reserved seats in the iits were probably created because something went wrong somewhere
5372156 however after we intervened and told the state to rectify the process of selection the medical colleges increased up to 38 in 2007 also 87 others qualified for medical colleges out of the state
5372157 at least 1000 members from each district of the state would participate in the protest rally he added that the budgetary allocation for various developmental activities for sc sts in the state was only seven per cent as against their population in the state which is 22 5 per cent
5372158 this would be the first step of the protest against the government before taking further agitational steps if the government failed to fulfil their demand
5372159 arrangements have also been made for mr subedar singhs son to pursue his studies in a local engineering institute
5372160 experts and the authorities are deliberating the situation in the ministry
5372161 we have lot of things to say but can we
5372162 its sad that government is not understanding the situation in the iit system the best teachers should get a chance to mould students into leaders there is no feeling of any social strata in the iits
5372163 the only consideration is talent and lets not dilute it
5372164 to let over 430 seats in iits go vacant is a criminal waste of infrastructure such as faculty and physical facilities reservations are meant to give disadvantaged sections of society a boost but where quotas cannot be filled because there arent enough suitable candidates the cutoff for general category should be relaxed so that all seats are used up the cutoff will still be higher than for sc sts so no one can argue that it will dilute academic standards as with airlines seats and hotel rooms these seats are perishable they must be filled the same year this should not affect next years quota
5372165 there is no time this year but we may try to seek permission to transfer the vacant seats to the general category for next year
5372166 it is a declaration rally to flag the initiation of four movements the national dalit movement for justice the all india dalit womens rights forum the dalit economic campaign and the land rights campaign we also want to reclaim the spirit of b r ambedkar
5372167 pas besoin dun plan de relance qui serait un plan de relance artificiel
5372168 just as margaret thatcher mended the broken economy in the 1980s so we want to mend britain s broken society in the early decades of the 21st century it s dealing with the issues of family breakdown welfare dependency failing schools crime and the problems we see in too many of our communities
5372169 i m going to be as radical a social reformer as mrs thatcher was an economic reformer and radical social reform is what this country needs right now
5372170 it is considered too sexy for us its not good for viewers in malaysia
5372171 we dont want our people our teenagers influenced by their performance we want clean artists artists that are good role models
5372172 weve created a very effective and efficient system that the consumers love
5372173 and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made and god blessed the seventh day and sanctified it
5372174 and he said unto them the sabbath was made for man and not man for the sabbath
5372175 and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made and god blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which god created and made
5372176 the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god
5372177 and when the sabbath was past very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the sepulchre
5372178 ye shall not add unto the word which i command you neither shall ye diminish aught from it that ye may keep the commandments of the lord your god
5372179 every word of god is pure add thou not unto his words lest he reprove thee and thou be found a liar
5372180 wherefore the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good
5372181 but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty and continueth therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed
5372182 and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to read
5372183 and paul as his manner was went in unto them and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures
5372184 paul and his company went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and sat down
5372185 and on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side where prayer was wont to be made and we sat down and spake unto the women which resorted thither
5372186 and he paul reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath and persuaded the jews and the greeks
5372187 blessed is the man that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it
5372188 also the sons of the stranger that join themselves to the lord every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it and taketh hold of my covenant even them will i bring to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people
5372189 and when the jews were gone out of the synagogue the gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath
5372190 and the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of god
5372191 and he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath and persuaded the jews and the greeks
5372192 and he shall speak great words against the most high and shall wear out the saints of the most high and
5372193 take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over the which the holy ghost hath made you overseers to feed the church of god which he hath purchased with his own blood for i know this that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them
5372194 the catholic church designated sunday as the day for corporate worship and gets full credit or blame for the change
5372195 the church on the other hand after changing the day of rest from the jewish sabbath or seventh day of the week to the first made the third commandment refer to sunday as the day to be kept holy as the lords day
5372196 and i saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven saying with a loud voice fear god and give glory to him for the hour of his judgment is come and
5372197 remember the sabbath day to keep it holy six days shalt thou labour and do all thy work but the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates for in six days the lord made heaven and earth the sea and all that in them is and rested the seventh day wherefore the lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it
5372198 thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honour and power for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created
5372199 for the lord is great and greatly to be praised he is to be feared above all gods for all the gods of the nations are idols but the lord made the heavens
5372200 i will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help my help cometh from the lord which made heaven and earth
5372201 whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him by this we know that we love the children of god when we love god and keep his commandments for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous
5372202 the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him
5372203 worship him that made heaven and earth and the sea and the fountains of waters
5372204 this strong warning is needed because the devil has deceived almost the entire world into accepting his substitute and thus multitudes worship or obey him rather than the creator
5372205 and i saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the beast and they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast and they worshipped the beast saying who is like unto the beast who is able to make war with him
5372206 and the third angel followed them saying with a loud voice if any man worship the beast and his image and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of god which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb
5372207 know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness
5372208 hon s tter ig ng med samma tr ning som tidigare
5372209 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not any thing made that was made and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth
5372210 his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood for by him were all things created
5372211 sabbath days which are a shadow of things to come
5372212 these are the feasts of the lord which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations to offer an offering made by fire unto the lord a burnt offering and a meat offering a sacrifice and drink offerings every thing upon his day beside the sabbaths of the lord
5372213 and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might
5372214 thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets
5372215 well since we are not under the law but under grace we do not need to keep the ten commandments any longer
5372216 for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace what then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace god forbid
5372217 shall we sin break the law because we are not under the law but under grace god forbid
5372218 now we know that what things soever the law saith it saith to them who are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before god
5372219 for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace
5372220 do we then make void the law through faith god forbid yea we establish the law
5372221 all right im going to pardon you this time but
5372222 but i dont want to ever catch you speeding again
5372223 therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life
5372224 after that he appeared in another form unto two of them as they walked and went into the country and they went and told it unto the residue neither believed they them afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen
5372225 the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews
5372226 but the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter nor thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor thine ox nor thine ass nor any of thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou and remember that thou wast a servant in the land of egypt and that the lord thy god brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm therefore the lord thy god commanded thee to keep the sabbath day
5372227 remember that thou wast a servant in the land of egypt
5372228 that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou
5372229 and if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land ye shall not vex him for ye were strangers in the land of egypt
5372230 thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger nor of the fatherless nor take a widows raiment to pledge thou wast a bondman in egypt and the lord thy god redeemed thee thence therefore i command thee to do this thing
5372231 for i am the lord that bringeth you up out of the land of egypt ye shall therefore be holy
5372232 this man went unto pilate and begged the body of jesus and he took it down and wrapped it in linen and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone wherein never man before was laid and that day was the preparation and the sabbath drew on
5372233 and the women also which came with him from galilee followed after and beheld the sepulchre and how his body was laid and they returned and prepared spices and ointments and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment
5372234 now upon the first day of the week very early in the morning they came unto the sepulchre bringing the spices which they had prepared and they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre
5372235 for as the new heavens and the new earth which i will make shall remain before me saith the lord so shall your seed and your name remain and it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another and from one sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worship before me saith the lord
5372236 thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made and god blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which god created and made
5372237 and it came to pass that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather and they found none and the lord said unto moses how long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws
5372238 for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he is guilty of all for he that said do not commit adultery said also do not kill now if thou commit no adultery yet if thou kill thou art become a transgressor of the law
5372239 for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit
5372240 i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me
5372241 here is the patience of the saints here are they that keep the commandments of god and the faith of jesus
5372242 not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven
5372243 he that saith i know him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him

5372409 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5372410 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5372411 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5372412 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5372413 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5372414 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5372415 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5372416 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

5372490 dialah yang menjadikan matahari bersinar dan bulan bercahaya dan ditetapkan manzilah manzilah bagi perjalanan bulan itu supaya kamu mengetahui bilangan tahun dan perhitungan waktu
5372491 berpuasalah kalian karena melihatnya hilal dan berbukalah kalian karena melihatnya hilal apabila pandangan kalian tersamar terhalang maka sempurnakanlah hitungan bulan syaban menjadi 30 hari
5372492 janganlah kalian puasa hingga melihat hilal jangan pula kalian berbuka hingga melihatnya jika kalian terhalangi awan hitunglah bulan syaban
5372493 janganlah kalian mendahului bulan ramadhan dengan puasa satu atau dua hari kecuali seseorang diantara kalian yang biasa berpuasa padanya
5372494 puasalah karena melihatnya hilal dan berbukalah karena melihatnya jika awan menghalangi kalian sempurnakanlah tiga puluh hari jika dua orang saksi mempersaksikan ruyat hilal maka berpuasalah dan berbukalah kalian karenanya
5372495 sesungguhnya bulan itu ada 29 hari maka janganlah kalian berpuasa hingga melihatnya apabila mendung menutupi kalian maka perkirakanlah
5372496 untuk itu mengamalkan dalil yang lebih khusus adalah kewajiban dan lebih utama penganut hisab menetapkan keabsahan hisab bersandar kepada
5372497 sesungguhnya kami ini adalah ummat yang ummi tidak menulis dan menghisab
5372498 sesungguhnya bulan itu ada 29 hari maka janganlah kalian berpuasa hingga melihatnya apabila mendung menutupi kalian maka perkirakanlah
5372499 disini artinya hitunglah yakni bolehnya menetapkan awal ramadhan dengan hisab
5372500 maka kita harus melihat konteks hadits tersebut secara utuh dan membandingkan dengan nash nash hadits lainnya jika kita perhatikan nash nash hadits lain dapat disimpulkan bahwa
5372501 berpuasalah kalian karena melihatnya hilal dan berbukalah kalian karena melihatnya hilal apabila pandangan kalian tersamar terhalang maka sempurnakanlah hitungan bulan syaban menjadi 30 hari
5372502 janganlah kalian mendahului bulan ramadhan dengan puasa satu atau dua hari kecuali seseorang diantara kalian yang biasa berpuasa padanya
5372503 berpuasalah karena melihatnya hilal dan berbukalah karena melihatnya hilal maka apabila mendung menutupi kalian maka sempurnakanlah hitungan menjadi tiga puluh hari
5372504 berpuasalah karena melihat bulan dan berbuka puasalah karena melihat bulan jika mendung maka perkirakanlah faqdurulah bulan syaban 30 hari
5372505 sebab hisab tidak dipengaruhi ada mendung atau tidak keempat penganut hisab juga menyatakan bahwa kata
5372506 berpuasalah kalian karena melihatnya hilal dan berbukalah kalian karena melihatnya hilal apabila pandangan kalian tersamar terhalang maka sempurnakanlah hitungan bulan syaban menjadi 30 hari
5372507 berpuasalah karena melihatnya hilal dan berbukalah karena melihatnya hilal maka apabila mendung menutupi kalian maka sempurnakanlah hitungan menjadi tiga puluh hari
5372508 lafadz ini dengan jelas menunjukkan bahwa ruyat dalam nash tersebut berarti melihat dengan mata telanjang bukan hisab sebab bila lafadz
5372509 yang dimaksud dengan hisab dalam hadits ini adalah hisabun nujum perhitungan ilmu falak dan peredarannya
5372510 hr bukhari seperti penjelasan imam ibnu hajar hadits ini menceritakan bahwa rasulullah saw tidak melakukan hisab oleh karena itu bagaimana bisa dikatakan bahwa tafsir
5372511 aku memasuki syam lalu menyelesaikan urusan ummul fadl ternyata bulan ramadhan tiba sedangkan aku masih berada di syam aku melihat hilal bulan sabit pada malam jumat setelah itu aku memasuki
5372512 namun bila kita bandingkan riwayat riwayat lain yang juga diriwayatkan oleh ibnu abbas sendiri maka terlihatlah bahwa perkataan ibnu abbas itu adalah hasil ijtihad beliau sendiri
5372513 berpuasalah kalian karena melihatnya hilal dan berbukalah kalian karena melihatnya hilal apabila pandangan kalian tersamar terhalang maka sempurnakanlah hitungan bulan syaban menjadi 30 hari
5372514 sabda beliau ini tidaklah dikhususkan untuk penduduk satu daerah tertentu tanpa menyertakan daerah yang lain
5372515 pendapat yang layak dijadikan pegangan adalah apabila penduduk suatu negeri telah melihat bulan sabit ruyatul hilal maka ruyat ini berlaku pula untuk seluruh negeri negeri yang lain
5372516 makna dari ucapan karena melihatnya yaitu apabila ruyat didapati diantara kalian hal ini menunjukkan bahwa ruyat pada suatu negeri adalah ruyat bagi semua penduduk negeri dan hukumnya wajib
5372517 apabila penduduk suatu negeri melihat hilal maka seluruh negeri harus mengikutinya
5372518 maka apabila melihat hilal ramadhan atau hilal syawal telah tetap melalui syara maka terikatlah kaum muslimin ya semua dengan ruyat ini dalam puasa dan hari raya mereka tidak ada perbedaan antara satu negeri dan negeri yang lain
5372519 orang orang yang menyatakan bahwa ruyat tidak digunakan bagi semuanya negeri negeri seperti kebanyakan pengikut pengikut madzhab syafii diantaranya mereka ada yang membatasi dengan jarak qashar shalat ada yang membatasi dengan perbedaan mathla seperti hijaz dengan
5372520 hilal bulan syawal tertutup oleh mendung bagi kami sehingga kami tetap berpuasa pada keesokan harinya
5372521 telah datang seorang arab badui kepada nabi muhammad saw kemudian berkata
5372522 sesungguhnya nabi saw menggantungkan perkara puasa dan ied fithri dengan sesuatu yang tampak
5372523 saya melihat manusia di bulan puasa dan bulan lainnya mereka ada yang mendengarkan orang tak berilmu dari kalangan ahli hisab bahwa hilal dilihat atau tidak dilihat
5372524 seorang arab mendatangi rasulullah saw dan berkata aku telah melihat bulan hilal yakni bulan ramadhan
5372525 jika kalian melihatnya seperti kalian melihat matahari maka bersaksilah namun jika tidak maka tinggalkanlah
5372526 puasalah kalian karena melihat hilal berbukalah karena melihatnya berhajilah karena melihatnya jika kalian tertutup mendung sempurnakanlah tiga puluh hari jika ada dua saksi berpuasalah kalian dan berbukalah
5372527 manusia mencari cari hilal maka aku kabarkan kepada nabi saw bahwa aku melihatnya rasulullah saw pun menyuruh manusia berpuasa
5372528 puasalah karena melihatnya hilal dan berbukalah karena melihatnya jika awan menghalangi kalian sempurnakanlah tiga puluh hari jika dua orang saksi mempersaksikan ruyat hilal maka berpuasalah dan berbukalah kalian karenanya
5372529 berpuasalah karena melihatnya hilal dan berbukalah karena melihatnya hilal maka apabila mendung menutupi kalian maka sempurnakanlah hitungan menjadi tiga puluh hari
5372530 dan orang yang berpijak pada hisab dalam menentukan hilal sebagaimana ia sesat dalam syariat iapun telah berbuat bidah dalam agama dia telah salah dalam hal akal dan ilmu hisab

5372543 this is a continuum that started back on 9 11 to reform law enforcement and the intelligence community to focus on the terrorism threat

5372545 provide specialized equipment technical knowledge or assistance of expert personnel
5372546 if properly implemented this should assure the public that people are not being investigated by agencies who are not trained in how to protect constitutional rights
5372547 the fbi will need to be vigilant both in its policies and its practices to live up to that promise
5372548 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information
5372549 it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government
5372550 in the right direction however the vagueness of the provisions giving broad access to criminal intelligence to undefined agencies is very troubling
5372551 a good number of officers have not reported today i cannot say what is the business loss for the day
5372552 the law is very clear that each state will have its own police force with a dgp if you make these police forces efficient only a few crimes can be given to cbi the cbi is our fbi
5372553 you can give some offences to the cbi for probe which have to be investigated under the treaty obligation like terrorism money laundering as also drugs related offences for which we already have narcotics control bureau
5372554 we have ignored the police force for decades many reports on improvement of working conditions have not been implemented and the quality of police officers has not improved training programmes like this would help
5372555 when substantial justice and technical considerations are pitted against each other cause of substantial justice deserves to be preferred for the other side cannot claim to have vested right in injustice being done because of a non deliberate delay
5372556 the high court unfortunately did not deal with those explanations and merely stated that the delay has not been explained the high court was required to examine the correctness of the explanation given
5372557 one cannot but take a practical view of the working of the government without being unduly indulgent to the slow motion of its wheels
5372558 the expressions sufficient cause is adequately elastic to enable the court to apply the law in a meaningful manner which sub serves the ends of justice that being the life purpose for the existence of the institution of courts

5372584 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5372585 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5372586 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5372587 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

5372590 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5372591 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5372592 we are making exercises to form the next government the situation would be clear in a day or two
5372593 despite the withdrawal of the support by jmm i am confident of my success on the floor the game will be witnessed in the assembly and i am prepared for a show of strength
5372594 we are with soren if he gets the numbers we will support him
5372595 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5372596 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5372597 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5372598 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5372599 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5372600 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5372601 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5372602 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5372603 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5372604 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5372605 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5372606 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5372607 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5372608 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5372609 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5372610 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5372611 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5372612 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5372613 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5372614 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5372615 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

5372649 immediately after plaintiff made it known he would decline to join hands and pray he was confronted in the presence of other military personnel by the senior ranking staff sergeant who asked plaintiff why he did not want to pray whereupon plaintiff explained because he is an atheist

5372652 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5372653 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5372654 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5372655 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5372656 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5372657 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

5372660 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry

5372682 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5372683 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5372684 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5372685 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5372686 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

5372826 then ask them hey how would you like a new car
5372827 and so you can also forget about capacity growth too because without the money to fuel the demand growth there aint no stinking capacity growth and thus there wont be any short run supply constraints although there will always be various government distortions
5372828 if emerging markets are driven by rising commodity prices and now those prices are falling how could that make for a good investment

5372839 com um cavalo ruim o rodrigo n o poderia fazer isso pois teria o resultado inverso o animal ficaria com medo e menos confiante
5372840 o rodrigo teve um ano dif cil para acertar o cavalo e chega sem press o por n o estar com o baloubet du rouet embora o rufus seja tamb m excelente ele est num momento espetacular e acho que pode defender o seu ouro
5372841 o importante era saltar hoje sem muita press o e o fato de o rufus ter cometido essa penaliza o pode at ter sido bom agora ele entrar mais esperto

5372871 so i think that their tales from the frontlines and the things that theyve seen and been involved in and their perspective on the war is a very important one that its very important for the democrats to know because the democratic congress was elected two years ago to end the war and completely failed

5372939 we did feel that on certain points on this tour actually
5372940 theres this huge punk blues scene in the states and some of it has a lot of bro love going on which is totally fine except that some bands take the bromance to this whole other level its usually not too bad but there were moments where we were like okay well were definitely girls whereas i thought we were musicians first
5372941 american is gorier its really visceral it splats across the road you see the blood before the animal itself but down in the southern states there doesnt seem to be as much gore i think maybe because its drier or something
5372942 stop talking we can spend a lot of time not talking and still not have things to talk about what was that movie best in show anyway were just really good at just shutting up
5372943 i had a nervous breakdown after i felt like such an idiot i was so drunk we had been sitting in the sun all day drinking gin and tonics so it was not one of my shining moments
5372944 we played with a lot of other punk blues two person bands on this last tour and we were like so do you guys get the black keys white stripes comparisons
5372945 the beginning of our relationship was pretty much based on drinking the second time we hung out with mint reps we drank 16 pitchers of mojitos then when we went to the office to sign the record deal they had a bottle of jack daniels and we drank all of that and pretty much everything else that was in the office that night
5372946 yeah he said that it was man music and it was kind of a joke when women played it
5372947 which is hilarious because that was coming from a white man
5372948 its funny a lot of women will tell us were empowering
5372949 thats nice to hear if that makes people feel good or whatever but were not setting out to do that
5372950 there was obviously something that was working really well with just the two of us
5372951 but then we got a call from our friend asking us to play a barbecue that kind of forced us to play our first show which was good because who knows when we wouldve played our first show
5372952 so it was really hard for me especially that first show i just stared at the ground i still do that a lot unless im drinking then its okay
5372953 i didnt really know what it was about until a few weeks later after i heard the recording of it and decided its about zombies and i like that im a big fan of zombies
5372954 were becoming musicians because when we started we werent really musicians
5372955 at least some of the songwriting is becoming a little more complex slightly sometimes therell be a verse and a chorus

5372963 i think that might come across that way if this story was told by someone else
5372964 i think even the worst of the woody allen films are better than most movies because there is always something unique or distinct he works small which i like because you can understand the whole universe in the details he presents
5372965 i also think that in this film the dominant image is of people travelling from one country to another
5372966 juan antonio understands that i think woody introduces what appear to be stereotypes to say behind the labels there are always people who are going through the same thing as you so when i read the script i wasnt scared i could see that here is a man who pretends to be free but he is totally dependent on these women because he cannot stand to be alone he is actually not free at all
5372967 in order to appear to be free you have to do a lot of homework
5372968 people say you just have to be natural but that is fluff to me you have to be real and if you get real you will find something important the difference between that and being natural is that in the real world if you are hearing bad news you usually realize it an hour later
5372969 if you are playing it in a movie as natural you just react and say oh my god the difference is in the details which comes with the homework its easier to get the right reaction across in the theatre because you are alone and you just make the decision on how you want to play the scene
5372970 in films its a process and there are a lot of people involved and you have to go to the director and ask is this the way you want me to play it and you hope he has the same vision that you have

5373021 the government has conveyed to me that the issuance of an arrest warrant against president bashir could have serious consequences for u n staff and infrastructure in sudan

5373023 the topic of the courses is campaigning and im going to be in the middle of one of the biggest campaign events it just seemed natural to connect these things
5373024 its a great opportunity to link the readings and theory well cover in class to the real world of campaigns and politics my hope is that students will be able to experience the convention directly through me
5373025 at one time the convention was where the nominee was selected there were battles and multiple ballots you didnt know who the nominee was until you got there that has not been the case for a number of years now its sewn up before you get there
5373026 the class will consider why we still have conventions and what role they still play in the nomination process
5373027 corporations underwrite parts of the convention through large scale donations called soft money
5373028 well look at corporate sponsorship of conventions as part of a general discussion of the role of money in politics
5373029 with the amount of technology im dealing with i realize there could be glitches and that well all have to be a bit flexible
5373030 i may be spending my overnights getting things ready for class uploading videos to the server but itll be worth the effort i can sleep on the plane
5373031 there are two directions you can go with this research
5373032 some might say this suggests that parents should have their kids attend places of worship or if we use it to help explain why religious participation has a positive effect on academics parents who arent interested in attending church can consider how to structure their kids time to allow access to the same beneficial social networks and opportunities religious institutions provide
5373033 for typical teens in the study the probability of dropping out of high school for those who attend religious services and youth activities at least once a week is 05
5373034 for teens who never attend services the probability is 084 over 60 percent greater
5373035 we know roughly half of american teens regularly participate in some kind of religious organization
5373036 so its important to understand what aspects of religious involvement can benefit adolescents in order to enhance their school success during a difficult but critical period of development
5373037 surprisingly the importance of religion to teens had very little impact on their educational outcomes
5373038 that suggests that the act of attending church the structure and the social aspects associated with it could be more important to educational outcomes than the actual religion
5373039 never late for meetings work is always perfect never get annoyed with people always work hard
5373040 both support the pregnant womens support act that will reduce the abortion rate in america by 95 over the next 10 years this discussion will prove that hope and change are possible in washington if we focus on creating solutions based on shared values
5373041 as a party we have to remember we are the big tent and have to make room for people with diverse views on this issue were hopeful that some language will be included that will say pro life democrats welcome but at the end of the day were still democrats and were going to work hard to work on things that we strongly believe in
5373042 political analysts around the country have been espousing for months that senator obama must be able to appeal to pro life voters we believe that amending the platform language would be a critical step in further including pro life democrats into our party
5373043 the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
5373044 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
5373045 the key linguistic debate has been whether to reduce the number of abortions or reduce the need for abortions pro life folks favored the former pro choice folks favored the latter the pro choice folks won in fact the 2004 platform said abortion should be safe legal and rare language that casts abortion reduction as morally preferable something this platform does not
5373046 there is no conscience clause acknowledging and respecting the diversity of opinion within the party on abortion pro life democrats had hoped for that
5373047 they are hoping that obama himself will go further in his own language specifically theyre looking to see if obama uses moral language that its better to have fewer abortions than not

5373346 cape town has always been seen as the most cosmopolitan city in the country so it made sense in every aspect to make the mother city the home of tens rugby in africa
5373347 ive played just one tens tournament but already im a convert it caters for all shapes and sizes whilst we think cape town is the ultimate venue with the perfect attractions and people here who will help make the tournament a massive success both on and off the field
5373348 with no loose forwards on the pitch it opens things up a bit more and lets the backs have a go
5373349 but at the same you cant neglect your scrums and line outs and theres even a time and a place for a bit of rucking
5373350 i have already spoken to some of my old teammates like corne krige and andre vos to come and join in the fun they have no excuse not to play

5373358 mcbride now says these witnesses made statements while being intimidated and coerced by police we say these statements are directly relevant to the defence of the accused and why they suddenly incriminated him after exonerating him
5373359 it is very clear what happened here no blood alcohol was taken there was no medical evidence and the accused was removed from the scene the actual versions of people who say he was drunk are vital

5373361 the quality of rugby at craven week and the academy week tells me the game will be a good showpiece of the quality we have i can confidently say the best talent came through

5373381 no podemos tener certeza ni afirmar de que por esa sola declaraci n podamos decir de manera tajante que es la coordinadora arauco malleco la que est siendo parte o que cometi este atentado lo que tenemos que hacer de manera muy responsable es esperar la investigaci n y ver quienes han participado en estos hechos
5373382 no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado raz n por la cual creemos que lo que corresponde en estas materias es perseguir la responsabilidad criminal hasta las ltimas consecuencias
5373383 los que hicieron esto son delincuentes vuelvo a insistir nosotros vamos a perseguir la responsabilidad con todo el rigor de la ley
5373384 yo creo que obviamente cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso
5373385 claramente este hecho es un retroceso y estamos a la espera de m s detalles sobre el atentado
5373386 la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario vamos a ser mucho m s severos en la represi n de los il citos cualquiera que sea la persona que los cometa cualquier delito violento no hay impunidad

5373392 but as something that feels artistically in keeping with who i am today i think that they are inevitably going to fall short of that as time goes on i mean they just dont continue to mean the same things to me and a new record is kind of where its at

5373412 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5373413 the level of objectivity at nbc news has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
5373414 mitchell did what has become a pattern for her of simply repeating obama campaign talking points
5373415 mccain was in a motorcade to the event and then held in a green room with no broadcast feed
5373416 mitchell is repeating uncritically a completely unsubstantiated obama campaign claim that john mccain somehow cheated
5373417 instead of trying to substantiate this blatant falsehood in any way andrea mitchell felt that she needed to repeat it on air to millions
5373418 we as a campaign have not said anything about it though the mccain folks do seem pretty sensitive on the point
5373419 he made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops
5373420 obama had no intention of bringing any cameras with him i was there i can vouch for that
5373421 it just seems inexplicable that this whole thing has been such an issue but clearly the mccain campaign wants this to be an issue wants to paint him as someone whos unfeeling about the troops
5373422 she has all of the savvy as clinton but none of the negatives
5373423 he risks a major backlash among clinton supporters should he pick a woman other than clinton
5373424 but there are few solid indications that he gov richardson is really on the list of finalists
5373425 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
5373426 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5373427 the same old folks that brought you george w bush
5373428 john mccain has never questioned sen obamas patriotism but he clearly does question sen obamas experience and judgment
5373429 john mccain all he wants to do is talk about me
5373430 the fact of the matter is at a certain point when government has not been serving the people for this long people get cynical
5373431 everybody talks about you know taxing the rich but not the poor the middle class at what point give me a number give me a specific number where do you move from middle class to rich

5373441 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5373442 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5373443 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5373444 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5373458 where people experience network issues we actively work to identify the issue and work to address them we have always done this it isnt specific to a device but just part of our ongoing work to make the network as strong as it can be

5373474 we couldnt all be cowboys so some of us are clowns
5373475 the topic of the courses is campaigning and im going to be in the middle of one of the biggest campaign events it just seemed natural to connect these things
5373476 its a great opportunity to link the readings and theory well cover in class to the real world of campaigns and politics my hope is that students will be able to experience the convention directly through me
5373477 at one time the convention was where the nominee was selected there were battles and multiple ballots you didnt know who the nominee was until you got there that has not been the case for a number of years now its sewn up before you get there
5373478 the class will consider why we still have conventions and what role they still play in the nomination process
5373479 corporations underwrite parts of the convention through large scale donations called soft money
5373480 well look at corporate sponsorship of conventions as part of a general discussion of the role of money in politics
5373481 with the amount of technology im dealing with i realize there could be glitches and that well all have to be a bit flexible

5373483 in maine traditional methods of restoring atlantic salmon by stocking fish have not been very successful with only 0 68 per cent returning
5373484 with the tagged salmon we can track more fish further into the ocean than ever before and get meaningful results
5373485 were not sure where they go in between but were hoping to find that out
5373486 the salmon crossing the line is evidence that the network is working
5373487 given the fact that we are looking for a fish that is still less than a foot long that could be anywhere in the northwest atlantic ocean finding them in such apparent concentrations hundreds of miles from brewer maine is remarkable and very encouraging
5373488 broad scale ocean arrays such as the otn halifax line are a great tool to examine the marine ecology of such an uncommon fish in a large marine environment
5373489 salmon are an iconic fish but theyre becoming endangered and people want to know whats happening to the population
5373490 this is the first step to finding out where in the ocean the salmon are dying and whats causing the decline
5373491 there are two directions you can go with this research
5373492 some might say this suggests that parents should have their kids attend places of worship or if we use it to help explain why religious participation has a positive effect on academics parents who arent interested in attending church can consider how to structure their kids time to allow access to the same beneficial social networks and opportunities religious institutions provide
5373493 for typical teens in the study the probability of dropping out of high school for those who attend religious services and youth activities at least once a week is 05
5373494 for teens who never attend services the probability is 084 over 60 percent greater
5373495 we know roughly half of american teens regularly participate in some kind of religious organization
5373496 so its important to understand what aspects of religious involvement can benefit adolescents in order to enhance their school success during a difficult but critical period of development
5373497 surprisingly the importance of religion to teens had very little impact on their educational outcomes
5373498 that suggests that the act of attending church the structure and the social aspects associated with it could be more important to educational outcomes than the actual religion

5373526 we should not deal with this memorandum as if it was a catastrophe in the islamic arena and i discourage portraying it as such this salafist group has set the future movement as its political reference responsible for resolving political disputes
5373527 personally i hope the signatories do not regret having signed this memorandum because hezbollahs history proves its disregard for those who cooperate with the party
5373528 because attacking this memorandum will produce a success for hezbollah
5373529 prevent another invasion of beirut as some think and it will not make the salafists who signed it loyal to hezbollah
5373530 i do not think we are on the cusp of a hezbollah victory in the sunni arena
5373531 security breaches of the islamic labor front and its branch in tripoli

5373540 so both obama and mccain are owned by the corporations this is news to you
5373541 a raise in the capital gains to 20 is still being criticized as being too high justly so in this economy the article interesting but it still shows an obama who wants to continue the myth that we need to somehow soak the rich

5373546 alliant has stated that they would prefer to build the coal plant in cassville but portage is the alternative site being considered by the public service commission
5373547 we have to begin to wean ourselves off of dirty coal and wind power is one of the best energy sources that we have to do that we hope that the public service commission agrees and focuses more on developing renewable energy sources like wind solar and biofuels that can help build a new clean energy economy instead of perpetuating our dependence on dirty coal
5373548 were generally for wind projects as long as theyre not located where they could do some other environmental damage
5373549 certainly more accessible and more reachable and we anticipate other projects down the road

5373626 party unity is an issue for obama in the buckeye state while mccain has an 89 7 lead with voters who identify as republicans obama has a narrower 75 17 edge with democrats delving deeper into the numbers it appears that residual unhappiness from hillary clinton supporters could be the cause
5373627 superdelegates werent counting how many of their constituents had voted for senator clinton or senator obama but rather how much money was being put into their war chests by the obama campaign and the democratic hierarchy this money moved from one candidate to another via pacs would determine their endorsements and ultimately the nomination

5373767 unfortunately these days with the safety car rule that street races can sometimes be affected by performance isnt shown
5373768 but if youre having a shit weekend it could help you

5373857 the last concept artwork i designed was done quite some time ago because the visual development of the game starts with the concept art for even the tiniest object in the world of sacred you have to create a visual concept otherwise nobody would know what this particular item has to look like
5373858 especially when you are working with a lot of external contractors which is the case with our project its extremely important to have a concrete guideline for every object that has to be created because that simplifies the communication and reduces the number of changes needed later therefore i spent a lot of time designing armors weapons equipment objects and all sorts of accessories and props its always nice to see an item that i visually created months ago after its taken its long journey through an external 3d modeling studio been added into into the database and then finally appears in the game sacred 2 is finished by now but theres still always a little thing here or there that needs a visual template i prefer to design creatures because i have a lot of creative freedom with them i get almost fatherly feelings when i see these little rascals roam the gaming world later on
5373859 as the production slowly comes to an end there are still a lot of things that have to be done people are constantly knocking at my door and asking me to change certain tiny things so that i have to work on several tasks at once my work doesnt get boring and im definitely one of the guys who awaits the release with a lot of hope and who are happy when the game is finally launched

5373925 it is invaluable to have an independent monitor who can swiftly question any adverse drug reactions or differences in illness and death rates between groups taking part in the clinical trials
5373926 parents also need to be made aware of the risks of adverse drug reactions when a child takes any medicine so that they can make informed decisions that balance those risks against the possible benefits the drug may provide their child
5373927 there is general agreement by pediatric health professionals regulatory authorities and the pharmaceutical industry as well as politicians and parents that drug trials are essential in order to improve drug therapies
5373928 we are calling for all pediatric drug trials to include independent safety monitoring committees to ensure that this vital work is carried out in a way that minimizes risks and maximizes benefits for the children taking part

5373935 as an inspiration to an author i do not think the cat can be over estimated he suggests so much grace power beauty motion mysticism the perfect symmetry of his body urges one to achieve an equally perfect form his color and his line alone would serve to give any imaginative creator material for several pages of nervous description on any subject mind you not necessarily on the cat himself as for his intelligence his occult power they are so remarkable that i sometimes feel convinced that true cat lover authors are indebted even more deeply than they believe to cats of ebony cats of flame for their books the sharp but concealed claws the contracting pupil of the eye which allows only the necessary amount of light to enter the independence should be the best of models for any critic the graceful movements of the animal who waves a glorious banner as he walks silently should stir the soul of any poet the cat symbolizes indeed all that a good writer tries to put into his work i do not wonder that some writers love cats i am only surprised that all writers do not love cats

5373946 there is absolutely no basis in the law for an attorney general to sue in the name of the state and then cut a deal whereby settlement money from the case is diverted to third parties particularly an out of state third party
5373947 the attorney general is required to deliver monetary recoveries to the states general fund

5374005 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5374006 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5374007 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5374008 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5374009 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama

5374091 the collapse of the hun empire after attilas death left a power vacuum in eastern europe through which once more wave after wave of nomadic hordes swept from east to west prominent among them the uigurs and avars the khazars during most of this period seemed to be happily occupied with raiding the rich trans caucasian regions of georgia and armenia and collecting precious plunder during the second half of the sixth century they became the dominant force among the tribes north of the caucasus
5374092 this is what archaeologists have learned from their excavations in the land of israel the israelites were never in egypt did not wander in the desert did not conquer the land in a military campaign and did not pass it on to the 12 tribes of israel perhaps even harder to swallow is the fact that the united monarchy of david and solomon which is described by the bible as a regional power was at most a small tribal kingdom and it will come as an unpleasant shock to many that the god of israel jehovah had a female consort and that the early israelite religion adopted monotheism only in the waning period of the monarchy and not at mount sinai most of those who are engaged in scientific work in the interlocking spheres of the bible archaeology and the history of the jewish people and who once went into the field looking for proof to corroborate the bible story now agree that the historic events relating to the stages of the jewish peoples emergence are radically different from what that story tells

5374096 at the moment it is not known why hair feels good
5374097 there are several changes that take place at the same time when hair is exposed to hair care products and it will help greatly to understand which of those changes is crucial for optimizing hair care
5374098 if for example it would turn out that there is an optimum friction between single hairs for pleasant touch the molecular composition of hair care products can be optimized to achieve this friction
5374099 those invisible to the eye changes have a great impact on how the ingredients in the products affect the hair
5374100 a lot of this is based on this fundamental understanding of hairs underlying structure and properties
5374101 fundamentally understanding the hair structure is really important in terms of developing products that really deliver

5374106 in americas history it has often taken courage to defend freedom of speech courage to speak out courage to return day after day when you can expect scorn and repudiation

5374108 freedom of expression is a fundamental democratic value citizens of a democracy should be trusted to form their own judgments about the views expressed by others including controversial and offensive comments the bccla will seek to protect basic charter rights so that opinions on all matters including religion can continue to be debated freely and without fear through all media of communication
5374109 freedom of speech is an american concept so i dont give it any value

5374112 the new theology of the first amendment class privilege over democracy
5374113 in the hands of the wealthy the advertisers and the corporate media the newfangled first amendment takes on an almost orwellian caste
5374114 the job for progressives and activists then is to raise holy hell about our corrupt electoral system and our bogus corporate media system and make it a key target of a social movement that takes direct aim at social inequality and class privilege and in the process of doing so we need to pressure the aclu to return to its roots as a force for justice and democracy or expose it as a liberal fig leaf for plutocracy

5374165 top performers resemble comets more than stars once theyre lured to another firm their performance plummets by as much as 20 permanently thats because just 30 of a stars performance stems from individual capabilities 70 derives from resources and qualities specific to the company that developed him such as reputation information technologies leadership training and team chemistry when you hire a star he leaves all that support behind so his performance flags

5374329 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5374330 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal

5374333 i kind of like the position were in i like going under the radar it makes you know we still have a lot of work to do no one else is giving us credit so we know we got to go out there and earn it
5374334 you feed off that and ive kind of used that as motivation for our team
5374335 we did have one month we still have a lot to prove to ourselves that we are a better team than just one month and why cant we play at a better level than that why do we have the ups and downs in the season like we do why do we have a streak where we play inconsistent football and sloppy football lets get to that consistent team
5374336 really im trying to see both safeties and trying not to get caught up in the free safety and have him tell you what to do
5374337 when you see them both it tells me what the coverage is and i get my read from there
5374338 you saw the focus in him late in the season where it all came together for him he avoided the interceptions did all the things we were talking about along the way he has that ability he has always had it and now i think youre going to see it all the time
5374339 for his part burress sees the improvement in manning as well

5374344 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5374345 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5374346 it was definitely frightening and there was a lot of whoa what are we going to do next and whats the morning going to bring
5374347 i woke up to people yelling weve got to get out of here
5374348 we booked it up a cliff in 10 seconds and we just saw this massive rush of water rage down the creek side
5374349 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms

5374351 if russia threatens poland then we poles have the right to feel threatened

5374380 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5374381 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5374382 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5374383 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5374384 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5374385 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5374386 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5374387 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5374388 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5374389 growing up in northern california i loved rickey henderson but i never put it together that they were both in the throw left bat right club until i got further into the game
5374390 select name from wpdb gt terms where term id category gt category parent
5374391 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5374392 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5374393 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5374394 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5374395 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5374396 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5374397 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5374398 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5374399 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5374400 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5374401 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5374402 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5374403 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5374404 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5374405 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5374406 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5374407 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5374408 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5374409 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5374410 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5374411 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5374412 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5374413 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5374414 for three years we have been saying that war is coming and the team has been working hard to deliver on this promise
5374415 in just a few weeks we are going to throw open our doors and invite more players into the game than ever before they will have a chance to delve into the open beta and see for themselves that war has arrived and it is glorious
5374416 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5374417 this is a planning took where all things are going
5374418 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5374419 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5374420 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5374421 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5374422 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5374423 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5374424 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5374425 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5374426 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5374427 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5374428 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5374429 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5374430 i was just 13 when one of my best friends brothers was about to sign a contract with london football team leyton orient
5374431 but one day he was walking the streets saw a fight went over to help got stabbed in the back and was paralysed
5374432 no one wants to see the devastation i saw my friend and his family go through we have to lend our support to this campaign you dont expect situations that are happening whereby people go to school in the morning and then you never see them again because of incidents that have happened
5374433 scrap tires along the u s mexico border pose major health threats for the millions of border residents
5374434 with the support of both of our countries we can prevent the creation of additional scrap tire piles and clean up our border communities
5374435 rapidly developing steel industry has produced huge amount of steel scrap which can be used as substitute for iron ore to make new steel products
5374436 steel prices are set to hover over a high track given that steelmaking ingredients prices continue to roar up the squeezed profit margin would phase out those mills with less competitiveness which would help accelerate the steel consolidation in the sector across the country
5374437 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5374438 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5374439 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5374440 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did

5374449 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5374450 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5374451 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5374452 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5374453 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5374454 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5374455 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5374456 you may have noticed that we started running a test of display ads on select pages of the youtube mobile site in the u s and japan this is our first step in testing mobile advertising for youtube it will give you a new way to interact with content on the go while allowing us to learn how video viewers engage with mobile advertising our test advertisers will also have an additional branding tool at their disposal and the opportunity to reach the millions of people who visit youtube every day on their phones
5374457 t mobile said monday it plans to launch a mobile phone powered by googles android software making it the first operator to do so and posing a direct threat to apples popular iphone a spokesman for deutsche telekom german parent declined to comment on the launch date for the device which is made by mobile phone maker htc according to a report in the new york times the phone will hit the stores in the united states before christmas perhaps as early as october the new device will have a touch screen like the iphone and other smartphones that use software from firms like palm microsoft and nokia to allow users to access the internet but the screen also slides out to expose a full five row keyboard the new york times report said
5374458 it was definitely frightening and there was a lot of whoa what are we going to do next and whats the morning going to bring
5374459 i woke up to people yelling weve got to get out of here
5374460 we booked it up a cliff in 10 seconds and we just saw this massive rush of water rage down the creek side
5374461 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5374462 were not as concerned about it as we initially were
5374463 this decision shows the determination of the ioc to broaden the fight against doping to those behind athletes
5374464 may lead to serious consequences to the health of athletes even threatening their lives
5374465 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5374466 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5374467 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5374468 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5374469 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5374470 we believe that the obsession with idealized beauty and body image is a lifelong burden that takes a terrible toll on all young girls and women in this country
5374471 whats really new here is the sheer extent to which women and girls are now willing to go to be beautiful according to standards perpetuated by a youth obsessed media culture with literally thousands of messages 24 hours a day
5374472 it will make it such a heightened experience for the audience and for us to cast a real life soldier a veteran and bring him into our created drama
5374473 its a very delicate subject to begin with theres so much about the individual person thats going to help us create the character and whatever they bring and whatever their challenge is will be fit into the story

5374477 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5374478 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5374479 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5374480 it has always been important to global connect to offer clients a system that is as secure as it is fast and cost effective
5374481 as we continue to grow and expand into canada we remain focused on the security of our system and with our customers ability to comply with applicable privacy regulations a number of clients in the canadian market have already taken advantage of our new data center to ensure that their security and privacy needs are met
5374482 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5374483 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5374484 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5374485 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5374486 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5374487 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5374488 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5374489 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5374490 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5374491 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5374492 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5374493 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5374494 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5374495 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5374496 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5374497 the difference between a weed and a flower is a zombie moneys last blog post coupon for free 46 oz bottle of v 8 fusion karen theres a concept in social psychology that while short term regrets serve no real useful purpose and stumble it
5374498 if you give 80 of yourself and the relationships ends you are going to feel like there is nothing of you left
5374499 we value the initiatives of local communities to provide sustainable buildings and facilities that mean people want to remain there
5374500 its absolutely horrendous and so callous and so cavalier of these planners to not take into account the 40 people that it affects
5374501 certainly not in the short term because the current market is not encouraging redevelopment
5374502 and i dont think anyones going to want to come in and take that risk at the moment

5374505 obviously the companies are not ready to go into iraq for security reasons
5374506 it appears that on present form the iraqi government probably wont proceed with most of these or all of them
5374507 all i know is there is water where it didnt used to be and im responsible for dealing with that
5374508 i think were at a crisis point on making a decision
5374509 it has been only 10 days since you faced a cowardly aggression you stopped a full scale operation
5374510 thank you for standing in the way of those who brought destruction and death to the people of the republic
5374511 you were the last hope of innocent people and your bravery saved lives
5374512 i am sure that such a well done effective and peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military
5374513 what georgian authorities have done is beyond human understanding it cannot be understood and left unpunished
5374514 the world realized that even now there are political freaks who were ready to kill innocent people for the sake of political fashions and who compensated for their own stupidity by eliminating a whole nation
5374515 if someone thinks that our citizens can be killed soldiers and officers who are peacekeepers killed with impunity we will never permit that
5374516 anyone who tries anything like that will face a crushing response
5374517 we have the strength and wherewithal for this economic political and military
5374518 it would have been nice to have had that money when i needed it to put my kids through college
5374519 after waiting for 10 years my disability was raised from 30 percent to 80 percent
5374520 all too often it gets bounced around and no final decision is made
5374521 with the va having trouble handling disability claims from previous generations of wartime veterans this new generation may be in for a long and bumpy ride
5374522 and unfortunately there are a number of veterans who have died before their claims are finally resolved
5374523 i heard clearly the dissatisfaction with veterans waiting excessive periods of time to have their claims adjudicated
5374524 a veteran should not need a lawyer to figure what benefit is due or to get that benefit
5374525 they told me i had a new right knee and many of the issues involving the knee were now resolved but i had a metal prosthesis in my leg and there were new issues i appealed my reduced disability rating and it took five years to resolve i finally went to rep brian higgins and within a week it was settled in my favor
5374526 were not where we want to be but we are making leaps and strides every day
5374527 at least three to four years but ive gotten used to it
5374528 if drug cartels can ship up to 10 tons of cocaine in a semi submersible they can clearly ship or rent space to a terrorist organization for a weapon of mass destruction or a high profile terrorist

5374532 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5374533 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5374534 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5374535 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5374536 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5374537 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5374538 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5374539 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5374540 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5374541 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5374542 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5374543 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5374544 after viewing the situation and consulting legal advisers and political allies with their advice i have decided to resign
5374545 not a single charge in the impeachment can stand against me
5374546 the only thing we learn from new elections is we learned nothing from the old ones

5374567 and because of that the pakistan army became a client army and pakistan became a client state in the eyes of the people it was a major failing on his part

5374602 its a great achievement for us its what we wanted to do and we managed it
5374603 having a gold medal and a silver for me a silver is like a gold because im getting something in the olympics and in the world championships so its a good achievement

5374610 i realise we have a lot of work ahead and i am optimistic with the support of management our coaching staff and the players we will move forward to positioning this team to qualify for this seasons mls playoffs
5374611 my ultimate goal is to win championships and build a club all of our fans will be proud of
5374612 while it has been a very difficult week i believe the end result is a very positive step forward for the galaxy
5374613 bruce is the best coach for the galaxy and certainly one of the best coaches in the history of the league i am impressed with his passion desire and focus and believe his recent experiences with the u s and red bulls have prepared and motivated him for this next challenge
5374614 he had to stay focused and just remember what he stands for hes the king of the hurdles
5374615 to go through what i went through and be back and be blessed enough to come back and be an olympic champion it cant get any better than this

5374622 after the world championships i managed to get to pamela and i talk to her and i told her you have a big chance
5374623 shes a good lady and i really respect her i congratulate her for winning
5374624 she used to tell me you can do even better when i hit a rough point
5374625 with the love of my mother i surely did improve my time
5374626 because of her encouragement i can do this im happy i made her proud
5374627 she has never beaten me she is talking too much so i didnt say anything i just wanted to prove who is the best
5374628 i am not deaf i can read interviews and hear what is being talked about it made me really angry because i said how is it possible to speak like this about me
5374629 when i found out it wasnt nice first of all because she must respect me and know her position now she knows it
5374630 when you join a big club you have to expect competition i have always thrived on it
5374631 i have always been up against big players at the club i love competing and learning from them

5374638 mr capello does come to villa quite a lot and i am not going to give up
5374639 but i want to play for my country ive played for the under 21s and i want to be in the full squad i want to get on the pitch and play and hopefully i can do that
5374640 but as soon as the squad is picked and if youre in the under 21 side you should be ready to roll your sleeves up and think i must do well in this squad
5374641 it is important that players view international football whether it be for the under 21 side or the seniors as an education
5374642 were going to go for an american sweep 1 2 3 and see what happens
5374643 im going to execute my race and see what happens

5374646 i just got in the rhythm and everything clicked i am happy with the time but as soon as i leave the stadium im forgetting the result and focusing on tomorrow
5374647 i did the same thing in the us olympic trials i ran a personal best in the semi final but still improved it for the final so this will not be a problem
5374648 i paused when susanna went down i was aware that somebody had fallen and i paused slightly

5374651 i guess i tried too much i wanted to run too fast

5374725 but most real networks are dynamic network links go up and down and thus some nodes need to recalculate their routes in response
5374726 is to tell everyone flood the topology change throughout the network and have each node re compute its table of best routes but that requirement to universally communicate and to act on each change is a big problem
5374727 being able to adapt to hardware failures is one of the fundamental characteristics of the internet
5374728 our routing algorithm reduces the overhead of route re computation after a network change making it possible to support larger networks the benefits are especially significant when networks are made up of low power devices of slow links
5374729 is in how information about changes in the network is propagated the xl routing algorithm propagates only some updates reducing the number of updates sent through the network
5374730 the rules ensure that selected routes are nearly as good as if complete information about the network were available
5374731 but at a fraction of the overhead required for maintaining such a state of perfect knowledge

5374789 we can learn from the west and we can learn from other societies honestly speaking none is born a democrat and none is born a good citizen it takes work and dedication
5374790 when the cloth of government is not seen as being stretched to cover everyone in society you tend to have these divisions so the issue for me is not tribalism but the way to handle governance distribution of limited resources and equal access to opportunity for all

5374822 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5374823 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5374824 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

5374849 he was from america when he got to the moon he heard a strange noise it was an azan the call to prayer usually heard from a muezzin chanting from a mosque the astronaut recorded it when he came back to earth the scientists in america analyzed it and they came to think that it was the voice of the prophet muhammad
5374850 furthermore he says that because of this the astronaut became a muslim and began praying five times a day

5374880 by the time i was 18 the anti drugs narrative had run its course and everyone i knew had either necked a disco biscuit or smoked a joint so when i first placed the soggy end of a spliff against my lips there was a grim inevitability about it all peer pressure made me do it pure and simple i was hanging around with a group of horseracing stablehands at the time they were all tough as nails and drugs were commonplace on the lower rungs of the racing world i knew nothing about racing but loved my pals and i wanted to be like them and be accepted by them they were hard drinking hard living characters one and all i took my first puffs on a joint sitting on the floor of shabby communal digs in an outbuilding on a stud farm while thoroughbreds whinnied in the dark outside

5374886 when you fall in love with someone and youre just overdosing off of their love
5374887 by putting her name in nomination youre putting people on the spot
5374888 having a roll call just chews into your broadcast time
5374889 i believe there are a lot of supporters for hillary among the superdelegates especially now that theyve agreed to place her name in nomination i think half the house democrats would probably be hillary supporters especially women i felt she was the most experienced and the best candidate and i still feel that way
5374890 it could backfire and show that her influence is waning chances are shes not going to have as many delegates vote for her on the floor as she had in the primary
5374891 i think that most superdelegates including myself are going for obama
5374892 i made my decision for obama and im not switching again
5374893 my boss is totally conflicted about it and pissed hillary is putting us in this position
5374894 we still havent made up our mind and i dont know when we are going to

5374901 ive done a lot to promote and change the way messages are relayed to our children and our families over the last few years
5374902 being exposed to positive content is what changed my life i believe that there is a market in our community for a new diverse network that provides a new brand of superior programming that caters to all aspects of television from reality to original programming
5374903 we think that everything is where its supposed to be
5374904 theyll be testifying that we worked in good faith and got everything done
5374905 preparati al crepuscolo della tua vita appena iniziata preparati a rinunciare a tutto
5374906 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5374907 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5374908 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5374909 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5374910 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5374911 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5374912 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5374913 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5374914 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5374915 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5374916 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5374917 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5374918 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5374919 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5374920 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5374921 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5374922 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5374923 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5374924 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5374925 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5374926 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5374927 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5374928 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

5374931 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5374932 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5374933 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

5374946 im not going to move out until they either give us a place to live in and to give us time to get everything for us to build our home but if theyre not going to put us anywhere so were not going to move out because we have no place to go said rita babauta
5374947 these are not absolute cuts we feel its something thats fair and that hospitals and nursing homes and other sectors of the health care industry can deal with
5374948 we have much healthier hospitals and a health care industry than we did several years ago margins are improving
5374949 if implemented providers would be put in the untenable position of eliminating the vital services which the patients in their communities depend upon and deserve
5374950 i just dont think were in an era where we can lock down a budget on jan
5374951 daines said referring to the standard fiscal year for hospitals
5374952 theyll just have to reopen those budgets and make considerations
5374953 i believe we can identify savings that will not impact our hospitals and other health care providers

5374978 many americans mistakenly believe that medicare or private health insurance will pay for their long term care needs

5374991 now my first question was the cone of silence comfortable that you were in just now
5374992 and you know there was the crisp immediate forceful response by john mccain clearly in a comfort zone because he was with his base and barack obama taking a risk in going there but seeing an opportunity and a much more nuanced approach the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because that what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5374993 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5374994 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects

5374996 ive always been fascinated by technology since before the days back through the mists of time when i played clunky games in colour no less on my amstrad cpc6128
5374997 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5374998 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5374999 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5375000 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5375001 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5375002 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5375003 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5375004 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5375005 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5375006 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5375007 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5375008 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5375009 who are open to doing something on the production side
5375010 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5375011 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5375012 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5375013 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5375014 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5375015 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5375016 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5375017 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5375018 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5375019 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5375020 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5375021 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

5375032 that reduces the amount of asphalt that could be available

5375034 the prices jumped after we had all our contracts out

5375046 the fact that this is a challenging economic time for the commonwealth should not come as a surprise to anyone
5375047 i am also concerned that governor kaine has offered no specific plan for closing these budget shortfalls
5375048 i do share the governors commitment to closing these budget shortfalls through spending reductions and not higher taxes
5375049 hopefully we will learn from this mistake and not repeat it again in the future we must take care to adopt realistic revenue projections and adjust spending accordingly rather than basing our budget on money we do not have to make promises we cannot keep
5375050 the news that due to inaccurate revenue forecasting by the kaine administration and the national economic slowdown virginia is confronting another state budget shortfall that will reportedly total around 1 billion is very disappointing
5375051 frustratingly many lawmakers myself included foresaw this problem last december when the kaine administration released revenue forecasts for fy 2010 that were exceedingly optimistic
5375052 whatever else history may say about me when im gone i hope it will record that i appealed to your best hopes not your worst fears to your confidence rather than your doubts my dream is that you will travel the road ahead with libertys lamp guiding your steps and opportunitys arm steadying your way
5375053 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal

5375056 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5375057 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5375058 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5375059 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5375060 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5375061 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5375062 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5375063 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5375064 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5375065 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5375066 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5375067 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5375068 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5375069 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5375070 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5375071 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5375072 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5375073 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5375074 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5375075 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

5375103 last year i could afford food at my house probably every other day
5375104 this year i cant afford to buy food very often because with the bills going up you have to cut back somewhere
5375105 this year we have a lot more people coming in and we have less food and monetary donations coming in were down probably 20 000 compared to last year
5375106 weve noticed a definite increase in middle income families coming in to our food pantry and its been higher than normal with your lower income families

5375111 were modeling this on austin tx s famous south by southwest fest and rochester fits the criteria potential audience numbers venues within walking distance and a strong pop rock indie musician base
5375112 even though were starting small with one night at one venue well have two stages featuring six acts in six hours

5375118 they try to make it out like democrats arent tough enough arent macho enough its the same strategy
5375119 all his bluster distortions and negative attacks notwithstanding it is hard to understand how senator mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country the difference in this race is that john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home

5375125 we have been fully involved in the review board that they had into the last failure
5375126 we have obviously ensured that the testing that went on was as comprehensive as possible and i think it is fair to say we are very satisfied and that things are in a good position to go for the return to flight
5375127 we are a global operator we always have been since our inception
5375128 this launch will give us a next generation satellite network that will be in place until the 2020s so for our user base it is reassurance that we have a network up there that will go well into the the future

5375139 hit the road jack and dont you come back no more no more no more no more
5375140 if you have something that is dangerous contaminated or nasty and you want it to go away safely you can rely on srcl the leader in medical waste
5375141 i first recommended the stock almost a year ago but there is so much good news that i thought this would be a good time to recommend it again
5375142 and while the stocks 12 4 gain since last august is not spectacular the s amp p 500 is down 14 1 over the same time period so srcl has outperformed the market by a wide margin
5375143 srcl is north americas largest provider of medical waste services
5375144 the core of their business is a fleet of route drivers who visit medical facilities and remove the medical
5375145 the next time you get a shot at the doctors office watch what they do with the used syringe chances are it will be deposited in a special red container with a stericycle label on it
5375146 srcl treats medical waste with the same care and precision that federal express uses to track a package their biotrack system uses bar codes and ocr to follow the waste from pick up to ultimate
5375147 this system helps avoid any errors gives them a clear audit trail for the regulators and gives their customers a sense of security
5375148 since medical waste disposal is a highly regulated industry srcl has developed a great deal of expertise in the alphabet soup world of government regulations osha fda epa dot etc
5375149 they have now expanded their business to provide consulting and advice on how to stay in compliance they also now handle the complex process of managing recalls of pharmaceutical products
5375150 since their founding in 1989 they have grown to be a 5 billion market cap company with almost 400 000 customers they now operate in the united kingdom ireland canada mexico and argentina and have acquired 130 smaller competitors
5375151 srcls revenue has shown consistent growth as usual revenue has increased from 17 to 21 per quarter for the last four quarters over the same period their eps has increased from 22 to 29 per
5375152 now for the new events that make this a timely recommendation on july 16 two long time insiders reported 20 million worth of purchases of srcl stock there have been other insider purchases over the life of the company but nothing of this size had been reported
5375153 insiders can sell for lots of reasons but insider buying is a reliable sign that the insiders think it is a good deal a large insider buy like this one is an even better sign
5375154 chairman jack schuler and director john patience said they bought the shares because they are a good investment and said that stericycles business is well insulated from the troubles that are roiling the markets
5375155 mr patience said his recent transactions were prompted by a dip in share price which he said was related to overall nervousness in the markets rather than the company itself this looks like a good time to own srcl
5375156 make sure you do them good otherwise youll do them tomorrow morning early
5375157 youd have had to plant a seed long ago to get where we are today
5375158 in louisiana at a high school track meet well find maybe one or two athletes that could be good enough for louisiana state universitys track program
5375159 but in jamaica there are probably 50 women ready to fit right into the program every year
5375160 jamaicans have played a significant role in the 31 track and field championships weve won over the years
5375161 we have to be creative because we dont have the resources
5375162 we had a choice complain about the resources and do nothing or work with what we have
5375163 we want someday to be the sports center of the caribbean
5375164 coaches have played a very important role and are still playing an important role
5375165 ncaa scouts come here in droves to recruit but our athletes often come back from four years at us universities tired and mediocre
5375166 my background is different from most coaches who were former athletes
5375167 my philosophy is based on doing things the hard way
5375168 i couldnt miss one day in church and my mom and dad still call to see if im going to church
5375169 none of this wouldve been possible without god and i pray to him each and every day but i know that god helps those who help themselves so i try to help myself
5375170 we are far in advance of the us record for preventing doping
5375171 sports is such a part of our culture that the disgrace of doping is so great that the jamaicans that live here wouldnt even consider it
5375172 in fact we just might be the measuring stick at this point in time
5375173 its a mindset were small and were poor but we believe in ourselves
5375174 were very disappointed for a country saying theyre opening up and things are getting better it sure doesnt seem like it
5375175 the chinese christians have been asking us for bibles saying they are desperate for bibles
5375176 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
5375177 we are delighted to have secured entry into the highly attractive u s pipe and tube market

5375235 i spent three days as a juror in a case in which it seemed obvious early on that no conviction could possibly result
5375236 a woman had called 911 complaining her fianc had been drinking and pushed her onto their bed the defendant claimed he held her arms to keep her from hitting him with a phone the next day the woman phoned police and the district attorneys office asking that her fianc not be prosecuted
5375237 she stated that she had overreacted and that she would do anything she could to stop the prosecution nonetheless the case proceeded
5375238 the only other witness the prosecution had was a policeman who had heard the womans original complaint part of his testimony was contradicted by facts that could be ascertained from the 911 recording in the jury room some of us speculated about why this case had ever been brought to court

5375248 there are often many good projects that are funded but the problem is the overall process that leads to corruption
5375249 it also leads to other bills being passed that otherwise wouldnt be passed if they didnt have earmarks attached to them its a way that the leadership buys votes from other members of congress its why our federal budget keeps rising
5375250 in a typical recession you lose one out of five customers because customers change their behavior
5375251 there are no more set formulas about how to set a price
5375252 in terms of your ability to justify the cost increase to the customer its easier to do if you can show that you dont have any choice but to pass it on
5375253 the danger is that the customer will always expect the lower price

5375266 history is made first sixty something white senator with deep foreign policy experience chosen to be vp nominee
5375267 elitist nominee you mean the guy who owns 8 different mansions and flies on his wifes personal corporate jet from one mansion to the next the elitist who has been a washington dc insider for the last 25 years because that would be john mccain
5375268 i helped get us into this war and i will join president obama and helping us get out of iraq
5375269 she has all of the savvy as clinton but none of the negatives
5375270 he risks a major backlash among clinton supporters should he pick a woman other than clinton
5375271 but there are few solid indications that he gov richardson is really on the list of finalists
5375272 look at the sky isnt it painterly look at the brushstrokes wow isnt it cool
5375273 john mccain all he wants to do is talk about me
5375274 a leader god has blessed us with at this time
5375275 the fact of the matter is at a certain point when government has not been serving the people for this long people get cynical they tune out
5375276 and they start saying to themselves a plague on both your houses they are willing to consume negative information more frequently than positive information for good reason theyve seen how promises havent been kept
5375277 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5375278 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5375279 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5375280 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5375281 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5375282 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5375283 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes

5375287 the name is hatred for what you dont even understand the name is fear of what you cant even comprehend
5375288 so get off your ass and take a stand stop telling me the world has done all it can
5375289 the reason we do this isnt because we see others do it or because its what weve been told to do
5375290 goes a long way toward suggesting these have a deeper biological origin
5375291 it makes sense because humans live in social groups and evolutionarily speaking navigating the social environment is important not just avoiding danger but living with other people and dealing with issues of relationships who am i going to lead or follow
5375292 shame is really stigmatized in western cultures were not supposed to talk about it were supposed to be proud of ourselves no matter what

5375447 we dont want to antagonize our neighbor iran or upset our friend the united states we dont want to get very close to america and at the same time distance ourselves from iran
5375448 u n collective sanctions are binding upon all countries and the uae has a duty to obey them but sanctions by the u s or europe are not binding
5375449 we are not party to it and wont pay attention

5375468 mason said thats so nice mommy ill get to spend the day with you tomorrow
5375469 if they have any anxiety they can talk about it
5375470 mine was a yahoo not a boo hoo teddy was very excited
5375471 we had a few children come this morning that had just enrolled
5375472 the teachers are smiling the children are smiling and the parents are smiling
5375473 its funny i was thinking as i was walking back into school from the car ramp that could be the case
5375474 dont you worry it gives them a chance to rest and recover from the first day
5375475 if we have one day off we will be right back at day 2
5375476 we have had a traffic flow problem so i figured wed be out here this morning
5375477 it gives everyone a chance to get a bell under their belts and the kids a chance to get re acquainted
5375478 its much better than i thought it might be everything is extremely smooth here
5375479 my daughter was a little nervous but not too bad i think i was more nervous than she was
5375480 i saw a couple of my rotc instructors and three english teachers
5375481 i thought we werent going to have school for the first day and i was kind of sad
5375482 this year i know where all the classes are and i know most of the people at school
5375483 sometimes summer gets long because you dont get to see all your friends this year i hope all my friends are in my classes
5375484 its nerve racking sending your first child to school youre dropping them into the hands of a stranger and youre just walking away
5375485 whether theyll have trouble or not is as much about temperament as anything
5375486 shes still under the impression that shell be in the same class as her brother
5375487 the most important thing for parents to keep in mind is their kids emotional states are going to be largely influenced by their parents emotional states
5375488 if the parent acts worried this conveys to the child i need to be fearful
5375489 like were a dashboard with these instruments kids can read
5375490 i love you and school is going to be so much fun
5375491 youre going to make new friends and soon youll be the best counter in this house
5375492 anything you can do to make this less strange and less unfamiliar and less scary would be a good thing
5375493 show them that you keep your promises that when mom says shell be back in hour shes back in an hour
5375494 id say im sorry but youve got to go to school
5375495 i did feel sorry for him but i couldnt let him know that
5375496 youre always walking a fine line between taking charge and being a good listener as a parent but at the moment of the drop off that is not the time to be a good listener this is time for the teacher to take over
5375497 i worried about whether he would be able to do it on his own would he know how to unpack his lunch box would he make it back inside off the playground
5375498 but lo and behold i had prepared him and he was fine
5375499 our oldest daughter she loved school the only time she cried was at the end of the day because it was time to go home and she wanted to stay
5375500 and he got aggravated at school because he was learning he wouldnt get his way
5375501 it all depends on how you the parent present school to them
5375502 do you ever look at my face and see me as i was at age 5
5375503 in fact sometimes you even look like you did as a baby especially when youre sleeping
5375504 i want you to sleep with me you cannot go yet
5375505 io ho paura di te vorrei che mi lasciassi in pace
5375506 i dread you and i wish you would leave me alone

5375509 show this past tuesday while she hung out backstage giggling and chatting with her crew
5375510 you could hear her going on and on because she was standing right behind the stage curtain
5375511 shes talking and talking meanwhile you have the entire audience waiting almost two hours for the taping to start
5375512 she leaves us waiting and everyone is sitting there complaining and then she comes out and doesnt say a word about it she didnt even say hello she got right into her script
5375513 it was so disorganized people fell over the press outside and almost trampled two little girls tyra was acting like it was a live sporting event instead of the most self indulgent narcissistic crap
5375514 should be read in the context of a company thats still in the mode of defining its resource base
5375515 these oilsands projects need a certain threshold to flick the light switch on
5375516 the other ones i think are still a little early in their lives to know whether theres sufficient resources to have critical mass to go forward
5375517 the set is outside but air conditioning vents make the weather bearable
5375518 the first couple of nights even with the air conditioning it was steamy in here but weve been lucky ever since

5375520 what used to go into agencies is going into treasurys

5375534 mr president mr president were you in the library with mr peanut last night
5375535 see now this is how people should run all their parties
5375536 if you have something that is dangerous contaminated or nasty and you want it to go away safely you can rely on srcl the leader in medical waste
5375537 i first recommended the stock almost a year ago but there is so much good news that i thought this would be a good time to recommend it again
5375538 and while the stocks 12 4 gain since last august is not spectacular the s amp p 500 is down 14 1 over the same time period so srcl has outperformed the market by a wide margin
5375539 srcl is north americas largest provider of medical waste services
5375540 the core of their business is a fleet of route drivers who visit medical facilities and remove the medical
5375541 the next time you get a shot at the doctors office watch what they do with the used syringe chances are it will be deposited in a special red container with a stericycle label on it
5375542 srcl treats medical waste with the same care and precision that federal express uses to track a package their biotrack system uses bar codes and ocr to follow the waste from pick up to ultimate
5375543 this system helps avoid any errors gives them a clear audit trail for the regulators and gives their customers a sense of security
5375544 since medical waste disposal is a highly regulated industry srcl has developed a great deal of expertise in the alphabet soup world of government regulations osha fda epa dot etc
5375545 they have now expanded their business to provide consulting and advice on how to stay in compliance they also now handle the complex process of managing recalls of pharmaceutical products
5375546 since their founding in 1989 they have grown to be a 5 billion market cap company with almost 400 000 customers they now operate in the united kingdom ireland canada mexico and argentina and have acquired 130 smaller competitors
5375547 srcls revenue has shown consistent growth as usual revenue has increased from 17 to 21 per quarter for the last four quarters over the same period their eps has increased from 22 to 29 per
5375548 now for the new events that make this a timely recommendation on july 16 two long time insiders reported 20 million worth of purchases of srcl stock there have been other insider purchases over the life of the company but nothing of this size had been reported
5375549 insiders can sell for lots of reasons but insider buying is a reliable sign that the insiders think it is a good deal a large insider buy like this one is an even better sign
5375550 chairman jack schuler and director john patience said they bought the shares because they are a good investment and said that stericycles business is well insulated from the troubles that are roiling the markets
5375551 mr patience said his recent transactions were prompted by a dip in share price which he said was related to overall nervousness in the markets rather than the company itself this looks like a good time to own srcl
5375552 companies will be begin to shift in some cases on a product by product basis the production of goods to net lower cost zones
5375553 chinas percentage of manufacturing in the world will continue to increase but the calculus now is more complicated its no longer o k we need 200 000 auto motors off we go to china those motors may end up being less expensive if secured in mexico after transport costs are considered
5375554 you see more companies seeking to grow and buy foods wholesale locally because more consumers are preferring it and with high priced oil more companies will prefer it in the future from a cost standpoint
5375555 he has been fighting and fighting until the last moment
5375556 if you have to trap 100 people on a plane and listen to someone banter back and forth for an hour or two that would be just downright miserable
5375557 genuinely cares about the problems of people like me we appreciate his continued trips to montana to let us know that we are not forgotten
5375558 senator mccain has become a strong supporter of the bush policies policies which have led to disaster both at home and abroad
5375559 this is everyman he is kansan and he is kenyan he is african and he is anglo american he is common sense and he is eloquence he is dynamic and he is down to earth
5375560 barack obama has inspired me to believe in politics again and most importantly the power of the ordinary citizen
5375561 although i still identify as a republican and still stand for some conservative values i finally feel like america has found a leader it can look up to and trust
5375562 the link between our countrys lack of an effective energy policy and our flawed foreign policy
5375563 i havent felt so energized since mccarthy trying to end the vietnam war
5375564 i would love to be a part of this historical event its so long overdue
5375565 the boys call me e rock and i do all i can to make a difference in their lives
5375566 this was the first campaign i felt i needed to support i dont have a lot of money but i donate what i can because i believe in barack
5375567 as a christian i have seen it repeated that evangelical christians are required to vote republican when i heard baracks call to renewal speech i was surprised this is change i can believe in and many other young evangelical christians can believe in too for the first time in my life i got hooked on politics
5375568 megan robbins was caught illegally downloading and sharing music files from several internet websites without paying for it over a period of three months
5375569 mr williams based on the facts of this case and the testimony you just what penalty does the government seek
5375570 we seek the maximum penalties would accept a fair and just verdict your honor
5375571 we do not want to minimize the impact of these crimes on the industry and artists who are the victims
5375572 we also recognize ms robbins financial situation along with lack of criminal record
5375573 in lieu off a fine you would instead be required to take part in a publicity campaign against the illegal downloading of music
5375574 one thing is for sure ill never download music without paying for it again
5375575 for eight years weve had a vice president who stayed in undisclosed locations trust me its already change we can believe in its just the next vice presidents identity thats undisclosed
5375576 the institutional culture of corruption embraced by the clinton leadership of the democratic party
5375577 unaccountable power for the clintons at the expense of the rule of law and respect for the constitutional processes of government
5375578 especially since it was days after she said she wouldnt take any more money from me

5375581 what used to go into agencies is going into treasurys
5375582 its just hard to make it i dont know if theres any other way to put it
5375583 i dont hear of many seniors who are taking unnecessary trips
5375584 their biggest fear is some two three four five years down the road is that we will be back in the depression that we were before
5375585 were not looking to the government to meet these needs
5375586 we should be able to step up to the plate and do this as a community
5375587 subjected to a torrent of foul mouthed abuse including being called a murderer terrorist child murderer bomber disgusting horrible and totally corrupt mrs tucker conducted this through a loud hailer and even crossed the road to get closer to mr duncan whilst he waited for a taxi

5375595 perhaps there is a mentality that you cant beat city hall
5375596 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
5375597 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
5375598 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
5375599 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
5375600 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
5375601 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
5375602 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers
5375603 we really want to get the message out to people
5375604 i got back the standard form letter thank you for your comment
5375605 the platform is unwavering in protecting a womans right to choose
5375606 it is also a broad victory for women recognizing that womens health care is not limited to a single issue
5375607 having her delegates tallied at the convention will ensure that this important step in history will never be forgotten
5375608 i perceived they were taking us away from rehabilitation and therapeutic programming and deeper into policy that was more about containment
5375609 breastfeeding promotion programs encourage women to start but dont provide the support to continue
5375610 let me repeat liu xiang will not withdraw unless the pain is unbearable
5375611 everyone expected liu to do well as well as he did four years ago
5375612 we could see he wasnt quite as strong as you expect him to be
5375613 but we didnt know it was as bad as it turned out to be
5375614 after liu xiangs injury i wont bother coming back to the birds nest for more
5375615 and will encourage him to come back to the track
5375616 i think they will be disappointed but they will understand
5375617 i just came here to compete and take the gold i dont care whos on the track
5375618 we are not here to help folks find unclaimed money
5375619 guys are trying to get used to each other especially in the preseason weve got guys rotating in and out so much youre hardly ever next to the same guy i think thats part of it thats why you play preseason games to get the timing down
5375620 its a little bit of both having new guys in new positions and getting used to the technique and executing your blocks
5375621 at the same time the other team is making plays we have to make and finish plays rather than allow them to get into the lanes were supposed to keep them out of
5375622 right now we kind of have an idea whos going to be out there were trying to roll some guys in including some of the younger guys who we may not have seen in a game setting
5375623 i was thinking about running before i even made the catch
5375624 im thinking about everything you cant do nothing without the ball im trying to make a play instead of focusing on little things
5375625 the most important thing on offense is to secure the ball first whether it be a handoff catching a pass or fielding a punt
5375626 as far as special teams ive never done it i want to go out and prove to myself that i can do it
5375627 special teams is all about effort its a one play kind of situation
5375628 you dont get to line up on second down and remake anything special teams requires you to go 100 percent
5375629 watching the films what i see is a lot of guys here learning the system working to get into place
5375630 its preseason right now and its trial and error were going to get better by the time the season comes
5375631 the lanes on the punt returns you have to be patient back there im seeing some lanes but it seems hard to get to them but im going to stay patient and work on it
5375632 i know they are great fans but there are also people i will say for a minute that i read message boards and got caught up in that whole thing
5375633 that even put more stress on me just worrying about what people thought about me people say a lot of times i dont care what people think about me me personally i dont care how people perceive me when they look at my hair but i like people to think great things about shawn andrews but you cant please the world
5375634 they are bringing the power back in pieces and working as quickly as they can to restore it
5375635 but for some customers it may take several hours before they get power back
5375636 we know how to change behavior and attitudes that is what we d o
5375637 we know what messages will work and what will not
5375638 fifteen percent is pretty much in the bag for orange county in 2006
5375639 i think we probably are not going to see 15 percent but i think 11 or 12 percent is still realistic
5375640 cyclical housing downturns have always occurred the good news is these situations do not last forever the cycles tend to run approximately 27 to 36 months so this cyclical downturn should run its course by summer

5375691 the board fully supports joe rives to serve in this important leadership position

5375695 faced with little agreement among previous studies searching for the genomic hot spots in bipolar disorder these researchers pooled their data for maximal statistical power and unearthed surprising results
5375696 improved understanding of these abnormalities could lead to new hope for the millions of americans affected by bipolar disorder

5375698 we not only lost the game but we may have also lost our catcher wang wei for the rest of the olympics he got hit in the leg they play hard and we play hard
5375699 if you have a guy at homeplate you never come up and try to hit the guy in the chest i felt that was an illegal slide and the umpire should have ejected him after that the game got out of hand
5375700 we do not throw to hit people he tried to throw the ball inside and it got away from him the umpire lost control of the game he created this
5375701 were not here to fight i would rather have slid but the catcher was in the way

5375728 russias economic growth over the past seven years has been driven primarily by energy exports given the increase in russian oil production and relatively high world oil prices during the period
5375729 russias economy is heavily dependent on oil and natural gas exports in order to manage windfall oil receipts the government established a stabilization fund in 2004 by the end of 2007 the fund was expected to be worth 158 billion or about 12 percent of the countrys nominal gdp according to calculations by alfa bank the fuel sector accounts for about 20 5 percent of gdp down from around 22 percent in 2000 according to imf and world bank estimates the oil and gas sector generated more than 60 percent of russias export revenues 64 in 2007 and accounted for 30 percent of all foreign direct investment fdi in the country
5375730 once again for the left if it is a question of supporting democratic states and those in them from tyrants or finding new creative ways of blaming the united states first well the answer is a no brainer and from paleos one expected a sort of georgias bigmouth stuck his neck in a noose so let him hang but the near gleeful admiration for the way ole putin took care of business in his backyard was over the top even for them
5375731 russias military says its withdrawal from georgia has begun but there has been no indication that such a pull back is happening
5375732 russian leaders have made contradictory and at times clearly false statements about their troops plans and positions ever since the georgia operation began

5375746 the tender was not successful whether it expires is meaningless
5375747 ea could have continued the tender for another month but they didnt only 15 percent of the take two shareholders agreed to the tender which isnt nearly enough to acquire the company take two has already said the original tender is not sufficient if ea wants to close the deal theyll have to raise the bid
5375748 i think the odds have gone up now theyre in a situation where some of the hostility has gone down
5375749 both management teams have agreed to come together and make their respective pitches i think ea is backing down from being hostile
5375750 it would be a good deal for ea because they need the content
5375751 i think the ftc will approve the deal i dont see any real monopoly concerns there
5375752 theres no question the video game sector is competitive one genre of the sector the sports category is dominated by ea and take two the two together would dominate sports i dont know if having a monopoly in one genre would constitute anticompetitive practices
5375753 i would not expect this to have any sort of ftc problem at all

5375761 the sign was developed in 2004 when we came up with the project good neighbor so that it could be used by sensitive crop growers to mark the areas where their crops are grown and so that pesticide applicators would know to look for these in the field and identify that with it being a sensitive crop
5375762 a lot of times theyre grown on small acreages and so they arent as visible as our larger field crops that we see on vast acreages and so a lot of times theyre a little harder to find theyre in peoples backyards
5375763 with the increases in farmers markets and other venues for specialty and sustainable ag type producers were seeing more and more of these everywhere
5375764 the cond nast traveler world savers awards recognize companies that are stepping up to the challenge of improving our world
5375765 this years finalists are setting standards in social responsibility in ways that we hope will become models for the entire travel industry
5375766 at vail resorts our product is the great outdoors and as such we have a special obligation to protect the environment in which we live and work
5375767 we are truly honored to be recognized as one of the leaders in sustainability in our industry by one of the icons in the publishing industry cond nast traveler but were not resting on these laurels we are continuously looking for ways to further improve the already exceptional experience we provide our guests and to do so in a responsible and sustainable way
5375768 today reducing energy consumption should be one of the highest priorities for any u s company with both the high price of oil and natural gas as well the imperative to protect our natural environment nothing can be more critical i am incredibly proud of everyone at vail resorts for their ingenuity and dedication while some folks may know the right thing to do our folks went out and did it what i am very impressed by is that our company will accomplish these reductions and lessen our consumption of a valuable worldwide commodity while at the same time we will be taking the experience we provide our guests up to a whole new level this year
5375769 i dont think anyone thinks that there is a migration happening
5375770 there doesnt seem to be a pickup in usage across any significant portion of the area analyzed
5375771 we plan to increase current production by four fold in order to do this we have ordered drilling machines and also we have expanded our company from 2000 to 4500 sqm and have started operating 24 hours
5375772 the mentality when you have good news is to have a party
5375773 only one thing has been resolved here and that is the president has removed himself
5375774 moving forward its the economic front that needs to be addressed
5375775 in the immediate aftermath there was relief we saw people getting very very excited about this
5375776 the security situation continues to be very very volatile the political situation has been eased but there are concerns about how the government will continue its agenda
5375777 im still quite skeptical whether the two coalition parties will be able to function effectively together
5375778 these two parties are very much rivals and their political aims are very very different
5375779 the coalition first has to decide what their policies are
5375780 id pay money to have that speaker talk to my group
5375781 following this topic closely will drive a normal person insane but it makes perfect sense to me
5375782 hopefully the process is to spot things that would be grist for the funny mill
5375783 in some respects the heavier subjects are the ones that are most loaded with opportunity because they have the most you know the difference between potential and kinetic energy they have the most potential energy so to delve into that gives you the largest combustion the most interest i dont mean for the audience i mean for us everyone here is working too hard to do stuff we dont care about
5375784 those types of stories that can almost like the guy in the green mile
5375785 suck in all the toxins and allow you to do something with it that is palatable
5375786 for one man to carry the burden of a nation from a brand perspective was never a smart thing to do
5375787 it is not all about winning it is about performing and performing at your best
5375788 the fact is that he prepared his entire life for this moment that is the message you cant give up and you have to continue
5375789 but in china you just dont have that many athletes of his stature you have yao and you have liu xiang
5375790 but the side effect was that everywhere he went he saw his own picture that put great pressure on him
5375791 i believe that the chinese people will understand the situation and will encourage him to come back to the track and have a good performance again
5375792 todays injury is a total accident i will still support liu xiang and i want to tell him you are still the best and hope he gets better soon
5375793 we hope that after he recovers he will continue to train hard and struggle harder for the national glory
5375794 if he strained it further and the tendon ruptured that could endanger his entire career
5375795 a lot of this was about the anticipation and they certainly did leverage that pretty well
5375796 because china now has so many other heroes we will have a wider field
5375797 like school girls nervous about their first day of class
5375798 several members of the u s softball team laid out their new uniforms the night before their olympic opener they couldnt wait to wear them and once they slipped them on the americans looked a lot like they did four years ago superb

5375802 the early word on the curious case of benjamin button again david fincher has handed in a movie to paramount that is quite long that hurt his last pic for paramount zodiac
5375803 the film starts out amazingly the story itself wont have any trouble reeling people in because fincher is a great storyteller and the source material is top notch however i felt this film suffers from the same mistake zodiac suffered from things fell apart toward the end the film is somewhere near three hours by an hour and a half forty five the audience was getting restless i could hear them squirming in their seats in front and behind me the last hour is ultimately weighed down by a lot of repetition that has to do with the romance between pitt and blanchett the film is truly great up until the final hour where things begin to feel muddled and unnecessary
5375804 i learned the washington journalists love lesson firsthand during the 2000 election when cajoled into doing an interview about mccain for a piece by tv newsmagazine 20 20 i flew back and forth to washington in a single day to be interviewed by sam donaldson only to learn later from his producers that whoops donaldson had decided he really liked mccain and didnt want to include anything negative in his profile
5375805 there will probably be a bunch of last minute registrations
5375806 i think some of the racers want to keep their plans under the radar until the weekend

5375808 so much in the beginning was just trying to figure out what we should be doing understanding what theyve done in the past and making contacts with sponsors and people who had knowledge of the event
5375809 and ive enjoyed getting to know them and work closely with them theyve really stepped up to the plate
5375810 and the different things that go on that you just dont think about
5375811 a lot of it the final tally will depend on t shirt and hat sales but were hoping that our total contribution will be eighty thousand or more
5375812 the border guards have allowed around 9 000 people and 3 000 vehicles to cross the border
5375813 it may be interesting to see whether there was any discussion about the size of rate cuts and their relationship to bank lending rates which seem to have become the interest rates that the rba has become most interested in for policy purposes
5375814 fiji will still be despite his bainimaramas absence a major feature of leaders discussions in niue
5375815 there is no reason why commodore bainimarama should not attend for those discussions as he did last year
5375816 should meet his solemn commitment to hold elections by march next year

5375860 premier ultimate is yet another step in the evolution of software support services as it departments focus on the availability of technology supporting their business processes software support becomes less about fixing what is broken and more about preventing problems from occurring in the first place

5376038 y cuando lleg la segunda noche doniazada dijo a su hermana schehrazada oh hermana m a te ruego que acabes la historia del mercader y el efrit y schehrazada respondi de todo coraz n y como debido homenaje siempre que el rey me lo permita y el rey orden puedes hablar ella dijo he llegado a saber oh rey afortunado dotado de ideas justas y rectas que cuando el mercader vio llorar al ternero se enterneci su coraz n y dijo al mayoral deja ese ternero con el ganado y a todo esto el efrit se asombraba prodigiosamente de esta historia asombrosa y el jeique due o de la gacela prosigui de este modo oh se or de los reyes de los efrits todo esto aconteci la hija de mi t o esta gacela hall base all mirando y dec a debemos sacrificar ese ternero tan gordo pero yo por l stima no pod a decidirme y mand al mayoral que de nuevo se lo llevara obedeci ndome l el segundo d a estaba yo sentado cuando se me acerc el pastor y me dijo oh amo m o voy a enterarte de algo que te alegrar esta buena nueva bien merece una gratificaci n y yo le contest cuenta con ella y me dijo oh mercader ilustre mi hija es bruja pues aprendi la brujer a de una vieja que viv a con nosotros ayer cuando me diste el ternero entr con l en la habitaci n de mi hija y ella apenas lo vio cubri se con el velo la cara ech ndose a llorar y despu s a re r luego me dijo padre tan poco valgo para ti que dejas entrar hombres en mi aposento yo repuse pero d nde est n esos hombres y por qu lloras y r es as y ella me dijo el ternero que traes contigo es hijo de nuestro amo el mercader pero est encantado y es su madrastra la que lo ha encantado y a su madre con l me he re do al verle bajo esa forma de becerro y si he llorado es a causa de la madre del becerro que fue sacrificada por el padre estas palabras de mi hija me sorprendieron mucho y aguard con impaciencia que volviese la ma ana para venir a enterarte de todo cuando o oh poderoso efrit prosigui el jeique lo que me dec a el mayoral sal con l a toda prisa y sin haber bebido vino cre ame embriagado por el inmenso j bilo y por la gran felicidad que sent a al recobrar a mi hijo cuando llegu a casa del mayoral la joven me dese la paz y me bes la mano y luego se me acerc el ternero revolc ndose a mis pies pregunt entonces a la hija del mayoral es cierto lo que afirmas de este ternero y ella dijo cierto sin duda alguna es tu hijo la llama de tu coraz n y le supliqu oh gentil y caritativa joven si desencantas a mi hijo te dar cuantos ganados y fincas tengo al cuidado de tu padre sonri al o r estas palabras y me dijo s lo aceptar la riqueza con dos condiciones la primera que me casar con tu hijo y la segunda que me dejar s encantar y aprisionar a quien yo desee de lo contrario no respondo de mi eficacia contra las perfidias de tu mujer cuando yo o oh poderoso efrit las palabras de la hija del mayoral le dije sea y por a adidura tendr s las riquezas que tu padre me administra en cuanto a la hija de mi t o te permito que dispongas de su sangre apenas escuch ella mis palabras cogi una cacerola de cobre llen ndola de agua y pronunciando sus conjuros m gicos despu s roci con el l quido al ternero y le dijo si alah te cre ternero sigue ternero sin cambiar de forma pero si est s encantado recobra tu figura primera con el permiso de alah el alt simo ella dijo e inmediatamente el ternero empez a agitarse y volvi a adquirir la forma humana entonces arroj ndose en sus brazos le bes y luego le dije por alah sobre ti cu ntame lo que la hija de mi t o hizo contigo y con tu madre y me cont cuanto les hab a ocurrido y yo dije entonces ah hijo m o alah due o de los destinos reservaba a alguien para salvarte y salvar tus derechos despu s de esto oh buen efrit cas a mi hijo con la hija del mayoral y ella merced a su ciencia de brujer a encant a la hija de mi t o transform ndola en esta gacela que t ves al pasar por aqu encontr me con estas buenas gentes les pregunt qu hac an y por ellos supe lo ocurrido a este mercader y hube de sentarme para ver lo que pudiese sobrevenir y esta es mi historia entonces exclam el efrit historia realmente muy asombrosa por eso te concedo como gracia el tercio de la sangre que pides en este momento se acerc el segundo jeique el de los lebreles negros y dijo cuento del segundo jeique sabe oh se or de los reyes de los efrits que estos dos perros son mis hermanos mayores y yo soy el tercero al morir nuestro padre nos dej en herencia tres mil dinares aprox 30 000 pesetas yo con mi parte abr una tienda y me puse a vender y comprar uno de mis hermanos comerciante tambi n se dedic a viajar con las caravanas y estuvo ausente un a o cuando regres no le quedaba nada de su herencia entonces le dije oh hermano m o no te hab a aconsejado que no viajaras y ech ndose a llorar me contest hermano alah que es grande y poderoso lo dispuso as no pueden serme de provecho ya tus palabras puesto que nada tengo ahora le llev conmigo a la tienda lo acompa luego al hammam ba o p blico y le regal un magn fico traje de la mejor clase despu s nos sentamos a comer y le dije hermano voy a hacer la cuenta de lo que produce mi tienda en un a o sin tocar al capital y nos partiremos las ganancias y efectivamente hice la cuenta y hall un beneficio anual de mil dinares entonces di gracias a alah que es poderoso y grande y divid la ganancia luego entre mi hermano y yo y as vivimos juntos d as y d as pero de nuevo mis hermanos desearon marcharse y pretend an que yo les acompa ase no acept y les dije qu hab is ganado con viajar para que as pueda yo tentarme de imitaros entonces empezaron a dirigirme reconvenciones pero sin ning n fruto pues no les hice caso y seguimos comerciando en nuestras tiendas otro a o otra vez volvieron a proponerme el viaje oponi ndome yo tambi n y as pasaron seis a os m s al fin acabaron por convencerme y les dije hermanos contemos el dinero que tenemos contamos y dimos con un total de seis mil dinares entonces les dije enterremos la mitad para poder utilizar si nos ocurriese una desgracia y tomemos mil dinares cada uno para comerciar al por menor y contestaron alah favorezca la idea cog el dinero y lo divid en dos partes iguales enterr tres mil dinares y los otros tres mil los repart juiciosamente entre nosotros tres despu s compramos varias mercader as fletamos un barco llevamos a l todos nuestros efectos y partimos dur un mes entero el viaje y llegamos a una ciudad donde vendimos las mercanc as con una ganancia de diez dinares por dinar luego abandonamos la plaza al llegar a orillas del mar encontramos a una mujer pobremente vestida con ropas viejas y ra das se me acerc me bes la mano y me dijo se or me puedes socorrer quieres favorecerme yo en cambio sabr agradecer tus bondades y le dije te socorrer mas no te creas obligada a la gratitud y ella me respondi se or entonces c sate conmigo ll vame a tu pa s y te consagrar mi alma favor ceme que yo soy de las que saben el valor de un beneficio no te averg ences de mi humilde condici n al o r estas palabras sent piedad hacia ella pues nada hay que no se haga mediante la voluntad de alah que es grande y poderoso me la llev la vest con ricos trajes hice tender magn ficas alfombras en el barco para ella y le dispens una hospitalaria acogida llena de cordialidad despu s zarpamos mi coraz n lleg a amarla con un gran amor y no la abandon de d a ni de noche y como de los tres hermanos era yo el nico que pod a gozarla estos hermanos m os sintieron celos adem s de envidiarme por mis riquezas y por la calidad de mis mercader as dirig an vidas miradas sobre cuanto pose a yo y se concertaron para matarme y repartirse mi dinero porque el cheitan satan s el maligno sin duda les hizo ver su mala acci n con los m s bellos colores un d a cuando estaba yo durmiendo con mi esposa llegaron hasta nosotros y nos cogieron ech ndonos al mar mi esposa se despert en el agua y de s bito cambi de forma convirti ndose en efrita me tom sobre sus hombros y me deposit sobre una isla despu s desapareci durante toda la noche regresando al amanecer y me dijo no reconoces a tu esposa te he salvado de la muerte con ayuda del alt simo porque has de saber que soy una efrita genio femenino y desde el instante en que te vi te am mi coraz n simplemente porque alah lo ha querido y yo soy una creyente en alah y en su profeta al cual alah bendiga y preserve cuando yo me he acercado a ti en la pobre condici n en que me hallaba t te aviniste de todos modos a casarte conmigo y yo en justa gratitud he impedido que perezcas ahogado en cuanto a tus hermanos siento el mayor furor contra ellos y es preciso que los mate asombrado de sus palabras le di las gracias por su acci n y le dije no puedo consentir la p rdida de mis hermanos luego le cont todo lo ocurrido con ellos desde el principio hasta el fin y me dijo entonces esta noche volar hacia la nave que los conduce y la har zozobrar para que sucumban yo repliqu por alah sobre ti no hagas eso recuerda que el maestro de los proverbios dice oh t compasivo del delincuente piensa que para el criminal es bastante castigo su mismo crimen y adem s considera que son mis hermanos pero ella insisti tengo que matarlos sin remedio

tienda y despu s de hacer las visitas necesarias y los saludos de costumbre compr nuevos g neros llegada la noche cerr la tienda y al entrar en mis habitaciones encontr estos dos lebreles que estaban

contest yo misma he rogado a mi hermana m s versada que yo en artes de encantamiento que los pusiera en ese estado diez a os permanecer n as por eso oh efrit poderoso me ves aqu pues voy en busca de mi cu ada a la que deseo suplicar los desencante porque van ya transcurridos los diez a os al llegar me encontr con este buen hombre y cuando supe su aventura no quise marcharme hasta averiguar lo que sobreviniese entre t y l y este es mi cuento el efrit dijo es realmente un cuento asombroso por lo que te concedo otro tercio de la sangre destinada a rescatar el crimen entonces se adelant el tercer jeique due o de la mula y dijo al efrit te contar una historia m s maravillosa que las de estos dos y t me recompensar s con el resto de la sangre el efrit contest que as sea y el tercer jeique dijo cuento del tercer jeique oh sult n jefe de los efrits esta mula que ves aqu era mi esposa una vez sal de viaje y estuve ausente todo un a o terminados mis negocios volv de noche y al entrar en el cuarto de mi mujer la encontr acostada sobre los tapices de la cama con un esclavo negro estaban conversando y se besaban haci ndose zalamer as riendo y excit ndose con juegos al verme ella se levant s bitamente y se abalanz a m con una vasija de agua en la mano murmur algunas palabras luego y me dijo arroj ndome el agua sal de tu propia forma y reviste la de un perro inmediatamente me convert en perro y mi esposa me ech de casa anduve vagando hasta llegar a una carnicer a donde me puse a roer huesos al verme el carnicero me cogi y me llev con l apenas penetramos en el cuarto de su hija sta se

lo ha encantado una mujer pero yo soy capaz de desencantarlo y su padre le dijo por alah sobre ti devu lvele su forma hija m a ella cogi una vasija con agua y despu s de murmurar un conjuro me ech unas gotas y dijo sal de esa forma y recobra la primitiva entonces volv a mi forma humana bes la mano de la joven y le dije quisiera que encantases a mi mujer como ella me encant me dio entonces un frasco con agua y me dijo si encuentras dormida a tu mujer roc ale con esta agua y se convertir en lo que quieras efectivamente la encontr dormida le ech el agua y dije sal de esa forma y toma la de una mula y al instante se transform en una mula y es la misma que aqu ves sult n de reyes de los efrits el efrit se volvi entonces hacia la mula y le dijo es verdad todo eso y la mula movi la cabeza como afirmando s s todo es verdad esta historia consigui satisfacer al efrit que lleno de emoci n y de placer hizo gracia al anciano del ltimo tercio de la sangre en aquel momento schehrazada vio aparecer la ma ana y discretamente dej de hablar sin aprovecharse m s del permiso entonces su hermana doniazada dijo ah hermana m a cu n dulces cu n amables y cu n deliciosas son en su frescura tus palabras y schehrazada contest nada es eso comparado con lo que te contar la noche pr xima si vivo a n y el rey quiere conservarme y el rey se dijo por alah no la matar hasta que le haya o do la

5376039 ich verstehe nicht warum jogi nicht von anfang an gespielt hat
5376040 in den entscheidenden situationen haben wir zu wenig getan das ist auch eine charakterfrage es lag auch an der einstellung
5376041 es tut mir wahnsinnig leid f r die menschen die zu hause alles geopfert haben die drei monate auf uns verzichtet haben und wir haben es verkackt
5376042 wir m ssen berlegen warum das so in die hose ging
5376043 death is better than living on this earth with the unbelievers among us
5376044 it is the curse of the thinking classes to imagine they can reason even the bloodiest mass murderer into peace
5376045 show me just what mohammed brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached
5376046 only through force and victory over the enemies is there security and repose
5376047 the apes are jews the people of the sabbath while the swine are christians the infidels of the communion of jesus
5376048 fighting infidels until they either convert to islam or submit to muslims as dhimmis is still considered by islamists to be a religious duty
5376049 the militants believe that controlling one country will rally the muslim masses enabling them to overthrow all moderate governments in the region and establish a radical islamic empire that spans from spain to indonesia
5376050 iraq would serve as the base of a new islamic caliphate to extend throughout the middle east and which would threaten
5376051 we are saluting to the spirit of our hero shahid
5376052 we tell them in as much as you love life the muslim loves death and martyrdom palestinians hit a new low setting up a boy unknowingly to become a suicide bomber palestinian children die as human shields for adult terrorist leaders israel tears for palestine child may 21 2006 it was always the case arab muslim leaders have been using abusing their kids as human bombs human shields or as general pawns in their propaganda war to smear israeli defenders
5376053 death is better than living on this earth with the unbelievers among us
5376054 there will be continuing enmity until everyone believes in allah we will not meet the enemy halfway and there will be no room for dialogue with them
5376055 islam does not coincide or make a truce with unbelief but rather confronts it the confrontation that islam calls for with these godless and apostate regimes does not know socratic debates platonic ideals nor aristotelian diplomacy but it knows the dialogue of bullets the ideals of assassination bombing and destruction and the diplomacy of the cannon and machine gun
5376056 wir dachten die werden nerv s aber so sind die chinesen unschlagbar

5376061 er hatte in den vorjahren eine starke trefferquote ist ein kreativer geist
5376062 er kann st rmer spielen aber auch dahinter was das angeht ist mladen hnlich wie guerrero

5376065 this new requirement addresses the need to stop flu transmission at a potential source
5376066 if they would get that done it would be a great relief
5376067 then i wont be so hesitant about her going to preschool
5376068 these vaccines have a very long track record of not only success but safety
5376069 i do not think that this should in any way be required for young children
5376070 there have not been adequate safety studies on this we dont know how children are going to react to this vaccine
5376071 its being able to be given the risks be given the benefits and decide whats appropriate for your child

5376075 die testergebnisse widerlegen klar die weit verbreitete ansicht dass es generell g nstiger sei bei banken als bei wechselstuben zu tauschen die ergebnisse des tests sind dabei zweischneidig einerseits kann man die praktiken vieler wechselstuben leider nicht anders als unseri s bezeichnen wo alles offensichtlich darauf angelegt ist die kunden ber die tats chlichen tauschkonditionen zu t uschen so kann es passieren dass im extremfall 24 von 100 euro beim w hrungsumtausch von der wechselstube einbehalten werden andererseits waren aber auch die testsieger wechselstuben und dabei deutlich g nstiger als banken

5376081 youre much more interesting to read now that you left the star liberating isnt it
5376082 i have what some may call a na ve belief that kenya is a haven of untapped potential
5376083 look around at kenyans making it in the diaspora i am a firm believer that restrictions of the mind result in restrictions in performance i am hoping that my belief that a compelling idea can come from kenya will fuel the right developer to see beyond themselves as a kenyan developer and more as a developer who the world is demanding a service from
5376084 the younger kids are focusing more on their planning and problem solving while they are actually playing the game while adolescents are focusing less on their planning and strategizing and more on the here and now
5376085 the single best predictor of their skills is how much they had played video games in the past and how much they played now those were better predictors of surgical skills than years of training and number of surgeries performed
5376086 so the first question you might ask your surgeon is how many of these surgeries have you done and the second question is are you a gamer

5376092 its very much a return to old fashioned conservative lending
5376093 the current global market condition has given islamic finance a great opportunity to show what it can do help to fill the liquidity gap
5376094 they dont allow infinite leverage and the structure that you will be seeing increasingly will be tied ever more closely to underlying assets this is the right time for islamic finance to spread its wings
5376095 the really complex products like cdo squared which has such a remote link from the asset that you cant tell when it is defaulting cant happen in islamic finance because debt cannot qualify as an asset
5376096 the complexity of trying to adapt even some straightforward conventional products like securitized products is daunting enough let alone trying to think of a cdo
5376097 a correction of the real estate sector would impact islamic banks involved in this business line islamic finance is not immune from risk
5376098 complete standardization may not happen there will always be variants
5376099 let us not try to design a product that will sell in every market some standardization may be required but it may not be an absolute hindrance to growth
5376100 if islamic banks step up to the mark then they will gain traction
5376101 be strong and courageous do not be afraid or discouraged because of the king of assyria and the vast army with him for there is a greater power with us than with him with him is only the arm of flesh but with us is the lord our god to help us and to fight our battles

5376115 there was a time seventy eighty a hundred years ago that we americans sat here in the western hemisphere and puzzled over why british imperialists went to places like iraq and afghanistan we viewed that sort of imperial adventurism with disdain but its really become part of what we do unless a president could ask fundamental questions about our posture in the world it becomes impossible then for any american president to engage the american people in some sort of a conversation about how and whether or not to change the way we live

5376133 hes not there yet but he was much better than saturday
5376134 und die gro e frage ist warum warum diese schwankungen
5376135 we have not seen an assault on taxpayers of this magnitude since the tax revolt leading up to proposition 13 three decades ago
5376136 we cant increase property taxes at more than 2 percent a year yet inflation is now at more than 5 percent annually
5376137 so if you are only increasing property taxes at 2 percent then how can you pay for things when inflation is at 5 percent that to me is common sense
5376138 with the high price of gas i thought every little bit helps and if i could save even 50 a month that would be a good thing
5376139 i drove everyday and split the cost of the gas so it was the same schedule everyday and i just got reimbursed for half of my costs
5376140 theres many different ways above and beyond the gas savings some employers give incentives for people to carpool
5376141 that would be a huge benefit if something were coordinated through work there are hundreds of people who work in this building and if i could ride everyday with one of them it would be much more convenient

5376149 somebody told me they saw green cheeseheads favre exclaimed afterward
5376150 anything surprise you about tonight favre was asked walking out of the stadium
5376151 yeah said a weary and hoarse and bloodshot eyed favre
5376152 that i could complete a pass do you know how different this offense is from what im used to
5376153 franks had trouble getting off the line keller had better leverage
5376154 i didnt have time to think said keller the best offensive tight end in the draft this year
5376155 you dont have time to think when the balls coming at you 100 miles an hour
5376156 just a different jersey he drove the ball against our first team defense
5376157 it worked out better than i thought it would he said
5376158 i thought i threw the ball well and moved around okay ten days ago i was doing yardwork
5376159 there wasnt a whole lot of swelling which was great
5376160 he said it almost felt normal today its a good sign
5376161 i rolled it pretty good but luckily nothing pretty serious happened
5376162 they said that everything is pretty positive on it because it didnt swell and it didnt bruise
5376163 if it makes as much improvement from today to tomorrow as it did from yesterday to today then hopefully it wont be long at all
5376164 physically i feel great i really do the balls coming out of my hand now i just got to find my delivery and find the release point and everything like that
5376165 there was no pain no discomfort or anything like that
5376166 we wont know until weve seen him pitch a few times
5376167 but we need to find out what ayala can do
5376168 but not being used on a consistent basis a bigger difference for kunz than anything else
5376169 i went home looked in the mirror and felt like it was time
5376170 we provided lessons to kids and it started getting more and more intense and i was like you know what
5376171 i was just getting the kids loose and i really liked the way the ball was coming out of my hand
5376172 i never played here the way it is now i only managed here
5376173 it wasnt a good time we made up it wasnt easy we had to get some things straightened out it worked out now im here all the time like i never left
5376174 if they hadnt stopped yelling i could see my career going out the window
5376175 we recreated ours before the game and he did it in the real game
5376176 with yogi and larsen here i mean what are the odds on that
5376177 this is the guy with a world series ring for each finger
5376178 but when they lost to arizona the next year i told him he had to start all over again
5376179 guys today ask about the clubhouse in the old stadium and i tell him it was so different
5376180 where the managers office is now is where the showers were we didnt have all this room they were careful about where your locker was when i got here they put me next to bill dickey because he was working with me as a catcher
5376181 the funny thing about the larsen game is that when we got to the ninth inning i told him lets get the first hitter because it was only a two run game
5376182 i think it might have helped don a little to think more of the game instead of the no hitter anyway it worked all these years thats the only no hitter in the world series and i came close to another one
5376183 i wasnt a dead pull hitter but the right field porch was good for any left handed hitter i hit to all fields so that death valley in left center i could get a lot of doubles i didnt like all that ground to cover when i was playing left field though
5376184 im coming to the new one next year you know
5376185 when i was younger all i really cared about was home runs
5376186 my approach was look for the ball middle in i was more open with my stance and all i tried to do was see how far i could yank a ball to left field i used to hit a lot of balls just foul or right down the line for home runs i used to hit a lot of foul ball home runs
5376187 hes got 300 ability i wouldnt call him a 300 hitter yet but hes having a good year
5376188 he learned that some nights you cant hit a home run
5376189 that was something he had to do take what you can get there are times when you know youre capable of hitting home runs without lengthening your swing and there are times when your swing is a little too long to hit the ball out of the ballpark so you have to think ive got to try to get base hits hes matured in that way
5376190 i dont know why it happened this way but i think over the last year and a half ive really matured as a hitter
5376191 i handle pitches within the entire strike zone a lot better for the most part i can bear down a little bit better than i used to
5376192 and hes a hungry guy were seeing the ability to correct his stroke
5376193 i dont know about the ground and what effect it will have
5376194 but i do really believe in this horse and im glad that hes taking his chance
5376195 hes very well the ground is not ideal but hopefully it will dry outsomewhat
5376196 hes won over a mile and a half and hes won on heavy before as well hopefully he is strong enough now to take on the battle hardened older horses
5376197 he ran on heavy ground last year so hopefully that wont cause a problem
5376198 jim is happy with the horse and we are looking forward to seeing him on the racecourse again
5376199 its always a big challenge taking on older horses in a race like this but hes a derby winner so he deserves to take his chance
5376200 the forecast from york has prompted yet more support for new approach as duke of marmalade continues to drift
5376201 the prospect of getting odds against about duke of marmalade last week was unthinkable but the juddmonte market has been thrown wide open
5376202 hes incredible duke of marmalade he looked like he was having his first run of the season at ascot in the king george he looked so well he was very relaxed he wasnt sweating hes a magnificent racehorse
5376203 you have to wonder if hell be as effective on that ground
5376204 new approach is by galileo and mr bolger always thought he wants cut in the ground
5376205 his performance in the derby was incredible he pulled hard but still got up to beat my horse tartan bearer who is a proper horse
5376206 were going to walk the track and see how things unravel its just a question of how much more rain they get
5376207 the ground will be testing no question about that the horse is in good form but we are going into the unknown on the ground
5376208 mr cecil is very pleased how hes taken the haydock race and hes given him the green light for tomorrow but its a very strong contest
5376209 hes returning to group one company and its a possible championship race he takes his chance and hopefully hell acquit himself well
5376210 haydock was very heavy he wasnt at his best on the ground but he got through it conditions wont be a disadvantage tomorrow

5376217 he says that some years ago an astronaut went to the moon
5376218 he was from america when he got to the moon he heard a strange noise it was an azan the call to prayer usually heard from a muezzin chanting from a mosque the astronaut recorded it when he came back to earth the scientists in america analyzed it and they came to think that it was the voice of the prophet muhammad
5376219 furthermore he says that because of this the astronaut became a muslim and began praying five times a day

5376225 we cant rule out the use of slavic looking people dressed like russian military for provocations and sabotage
5376226 i can confirm right now is that as we speak russian forces are heading deeper into georgian territory
5376227 if it rolled in after august 6 it needs to roll out

5376382 the irony is that the folks who have had a stranglehold on power in philadelphia have actually been pretty solid on the issues
5376383 theyre very progressive elected officials so its been tough to make a public issue of it
5376384 its more about the process the access and political reform

5376455 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5376456 it has been only 10 days since you faced a cowardly aggression
5376457 i am sure that such a well done effective and peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military
5376458 the world realized that even now there are political freaks who were ready to kill innocent people for the sake of political fashions and who compensated for their own stupidity by eliminating a whole nation
5376459 he was essentially the librarian for a myriad of images that were distributed to like minded individuals both in this country and elsewhere
5376460 this is really a young man who has fallen into that stereotype of a rather sad and lonely teenager who spends too much time in a darkened room in front of a computer screen
5376461 he has not had much life experience to get himself mature

5376463 if you are going to do something do it to 100 of your capability or dont bother doing it at all
5376464 you set your boundaries you set your life up you get used to the area you get used to the people you dont want to go
5376465 this lawsuit is about understanding what you have been through advocating for you and ensuring justice is done and your stories are told
5376466 faith is just a worldview and everybody has some kind of worldview and its important to know what they are
5376467 does evil exist and if it does do we ignore it do we negotiate with it do we contain it or do we defeat it
5376468 the civil rights act of 64 says that faith based organizations have the right to hire people that believe like they do would you insist that faith based organizations forfeit that right to access federal funds
5376469 as christians we are called to help orphans widows the sick the poor and others in need should we ask or expect the government to pay us to do what god calls us to do
5376470 america right now ranks 19th in high school graduation were first in incarcertaions eighty percent of americans recently polled said they believe in merit pay for teachers do you think better teachers should be paid better
5376471 i still think a church is no place for a campaign event and a clergy person has no business posing as political moderator
5376472 were going to take our time and assess what further consequences there should be to the relationship
5376473 the facts are that the united states has to work with russia on iran on nuclear problems of proliferation on a whole raft of trade issues at a time in which the united states has a huge domestic deficit
5376474 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5376475 the whole world is looking at russia through a different set of lenses than just a week and a half or two weeks ago so there are already consequences
5376476 i think they may not appreciate the magnitude of those consequences yet the longer they take to get out and to observe the cease fire thats been declared and the arrangements that have been worked out i think the greater those consequences will be
5376477 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5376478 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5376479 if i would ask you how fast the american forces can leave iraq the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5376480 the same answer would be toward this situation as soon as we are assured that georgians will not continue to use military force against south ossetians and against abkhazians
5376481 investors have been trying to put the housing and credit crisis behind them they want to believe were in the eighth or ninth inning but every time news like this comes up they have to readjust their thinking
5376482 we are still in the throes of the credit crisis
5376483 theres risk that fannie mae and freddie mac may require capital from the government
5376484 if you can find things that explode you can also find things that move but you need different tools to look for them
5376485 it could have formed like pluto in the belt of icy debris beyond neptune then been kicked to large distance by a gravitational encounter with neptune or uranus
5376486 however we think it is more probable that sq372 comes from the inner edge of the oort cloud
5376487 the existence of an inner oort cloud has been theoretically predicted for many years but sq372 and perhaps sedna are the first objects we have found that seem to originate there its exciting that we are beginning to verify these predictions
5376488 there are bound to be many more objects like this waiting to be discovered by the next generation of surveys which will search to fainter levels and cover more area
5376489 in a decade we should know a lot more about this population than we do now
5376490 is to understand the origin of comets which are among the most spectacular celestial events
5376491 i cannot rule out that they might use mercenaries with slavic appearance for a provocation clad in the uniform of russian servicemen in order to commit subversive acts both on ossetian and russian territory
5376492 the georgian peacekeeping contingent was given the task to stop and obstruct the advancement of russian forces through the roki tunnel should they try to help the peacekeeping group
5376493 for this purpose they stockpiled arms by various means which could be used to arrange a bloodbath and obstruct the movement of any convoys in both the tunnel and the mountain pass
5376494 students feel secure to know if there has been an incident i e bullying
5376495 no one really knows enough about the use of cctv in schools its a very new issue we have set up a working group to look into the use of cctv and produce atl guidelines on best practice for schools and colleges throughout the uk
5376496 certainly we would want staff to be involved in decisions about the use of cctv in schools and strict safeguards for its use

5376525 russias invasion of georgian territory last week in addition to reasserting moscows military strength has complicated europes effort to diversify its oil and gas supplies away from the growing dominance of kremlin controlled energy giant gazprom in the post soviet era and particularly since 9 11 central asia has become a central focus for western countries looking for more secure energy sources but this weeks offensive during which british petroleum shut down an oil pipeline and temporarily stopped pumping gas through georgia has called into question plans for a eurasian corridor free from russian interference the caspian region is wondering what this means for the future says giorgi vashakmadze an energy executive in georgia russia is showing it controls this corridor the russo georgian conflict is the latest in a series of setbacks for europes planned nabucco pipeline its best hope of weaning itself off gazprom which set off alarm bells by cutting crucial gas supplies to the continent in the winters of 2006 and 2008
5376526 it was really tough especially the run i decided to go out hard and just tried to hang on as long as i could then find someone who was my own pace
5376527 the race was four laps and i was just counting down the ks to the end that last one kilometre i think i felt like i had asthma even though i dont
5376528 i was just trying to run as fast as i could i could see debbie and sam on the u turns but i was really just running my own race i had such a good transition but emma came past me and i tried to hang on but she pushed the pace down the corner around the dam
5376529 ive felt better its a really challenging bike course which was always going to take a lot out of your legs with the heat and the hills the girls put everything out there and really attacked right from the start
5376530 it took me a while to get into my pace and unfortunately it was a bit too long but i found my legs in the end and managed to get in the top 10
5376531 im pretty disappointed i had a great swim and felt all right on the bike but then i got tripped in transition and i think i cut my foot
5376532 it was about putting some confidence back into the girls
5376533 we lost games we had been targeting for four years for the teams you need to beat you need to step it up a few notches
5376534 with so many gen yers still living at home with mum and dad its not surprising they are less affected by an economic downturn in comparison to home owners and young families

5376546 if the fight was important enough i think i could just get down to 12 stone 7lbs
5376547 but if a big fight was presented to me like a chad dawson even the winner of kelly pavlik or bernard hopkins and there was enough money on the table yes i might take the chance
5376548 i might take the risk but at the moment i am a cruiserweight and i want to clean up the cruiserweights
5376549 but never say never if i get a big offer and something meaningful on the table id definitely think about it
5376550 im fit im strong and ive got a lot of people to prove wrong at the moment
5376551 i feel like a dangerous man i was meant to fight on july 19 that didnt happen but im ready to go
5376552 i saw banks last fight and thought he was pretty useless to be honest but look at my last fight and i was pretty useless myself
5376553 you look at the last fight i didnt look impressive he didnt look impressive
5376554 people are going to be questioning which enzo turns up will i be gunshy will i be lacking confidence i can tell johnathon banks right now as soon as that bell goes ill be coming out swinging
5376555 bruce is the best coach for the galaxy and certainly one of the best coaches in the history of the league

5376633 the institutional culture of corruption embraced by the clinton leadership of the democratic party
5376634 unaccountable power for the clintons at the expense of the rule of law and respect for the constitutional processes of government
5376635 especially since it was days after she said she wouldnt take any more money from me
5376636 it may be interesting to see whether there was any discussion about the size of rate cuts and their relationship to bank lending rates which seem to have become the interest rates that the rba has become most interested in for policy purposes
5376637 there is absolutely no excuse for banks not to pass an official rate cut from the reserve bank in full should that occur

5376645 in matters of national security good judgement will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded 10 days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5376646 it was a moment when political self interest and the national interest parted ways
5376647 for my part with so much in the balance it was an easy call as i said at the time i would rather lose an election than lose a war
5376648 even in retrospect obama would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5376649 all his bluster distortions and negative attacks notwithstanding it is hard to understand how senator mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5376650 the difference in this race is that john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion dollars a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home

5376670 by the end of the day if the weather cooperates we can probably get all of our tourists out of there
5376671 it was definitely frightening and there was a lot of whoa what are we going to do next and whats the morning going to bring
5376672 i woke up to people yelling weve got to get out of here
5376673 we booked it up a cliff in 10 seconds and we just saw this massive rush of water rage down the creek side
5376674 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5376675 they started with the assumption that asphalt gets frakking hot
5376676 this will be my last match i wanted to take gold so i consider this olympics a failure
5376677 if they say no then well have to re think things
5376678 that is what we are doing now and from here on end
5376679 there are a lot of people who are scurrying now

5376684 lo que m s nos proh ben es lo que m s nos atrae
5376685 i think the reason i was successful was because i had pretty good command of my fastball
5376686 in the later innings i was throwing breaking balls for strikes and i think i could have done a little better job of throwing more off speed pitches earlier on in the count the big thing that helped me today was the command of my fastball to overpower hitters with it and using the off speed when i had to
5376687 i try to stay with my fastball as long as i can into a game
5376688 if i can use it into the fourth or fifth inning without throwing any off speed pitches i will just because you dont want to let those hitters see your off speed if they dont have to see it but i will throw them early in the count so hitters cant sit on my fastball even if you throw 100 mph if theyre sitting on it its an easy pitch to hit i do like to throw breaking balls in 0 0 counts just to keep guys from sitting on a fastball
5376689 hes got good breaking stuff too but he needs really to stay on his fastball and establish it but hes got a fine arm youre throwing 94 95 youve got to establish that and stay with it and then the fastball gets that much better
5376690 mechanically the only big thing ive changed is focusing most of my weight in my balance point on the inner part of my foot on my push off foot which helps me take everything to the plate
5376691 i dont throw across my body as much as i used to
5376692 i got acclimated to pro ball in the arizona fall league a little bit had some success out there so that gave me a lot of confidence coming into this season
5376693 id say the big thing is just the grind of all the games and kind of changing your workout regimen because in college i worked out three days a week
5376694 you cant do as much because you dont want to be sore for your next start in college i could lift pretty heavy because i had six days off between starts youve got to kind of tone it down a little lighter weight higher reps its trying to maintain strength and not trying to gain strength
5376695 i was actually in frederick and our manager called me into his office
5376696 he asked me what did you do wrong i was kind of confused i didnt what he was talking about i was like i dont know what happened he was like well you made the olympic team i was kind of shocked at first it took a while for it to sink in but over the next couple days i had time to sit down and think about it it brought back a lot of memories from the college national team two years ago im just ecstatic that i have the opportunity to be a part of this once again
5376697 you better hope you marry rich you have expensive taste
5376698 sen obama made it clear that he was really going to get into the nuts and bolts of the kinds of questions oregonians are talking about and i think it has served him well in our state
5376699 im confident that once sen obama gets as well known in these larger states as he has in oregon he is going to see the same success elswhere

5376703 consumers have to make sure they understand the credit thoroughly
5376704 breaking the log jam of unsold homes is something we are very much behind
5376705 it will help chip away at inventory levels stabilize prices and spur sales activity
5376706 buyers flocked to market and cleared out a then record inventory of homes
5376707 the 7 500 reserve will make borrowers less likely to fall into default
5376708 its not going to provide first time home buyers with cash up front
5376709 you have to apply to get the credit after the fact theres a delay before you get the financial advantage
5376710 consumers have to have their eyes open about how this works
5376711 given the economy it will only push a precious few first time home buyers over the edge right now
5376712 the challenge right now is as much willingness to buy as affordability
5376713 the market still has this psychological barrier because people think prices will be lower tomorrow i dont think this can overcome that barrier

5376726 the reason for destruction of all my relationships is that im passionate about being on the road and making music i have great relationships but the women i date dont realize that i spend between 6 and 8 months of my life on the road touring or traveling or seeing family with my daughters
5376727 wait till they travel on a bus and are living in and out of a suitcase under the bay of the hotel

5376729 im pretty honest with the girls i tell them look were dating theres no white picket fence its not like all of a sudden the shows over and the next day were married and that kind of thing
5376730 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5376731 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
5376732 were not selling them we give them free to the people
5376733 we didnt come to cause trouble we just came to bring bibles to help out the chinese christians
5376734 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5376735 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission
5376736 by far the most profound beautiful thing we could have ever done
5376737 i think that jay is iconic hes jay z i bang his albums
5376738 he can use that against me if he like and say im a fan of him and diss me and say whatever he want but the bottom line is that im too disrespectful for jay z i go too hard his beef is mediocre beef its more swag and less hardcore i go in on your grandma and your kids and your girl it will get ugly
5376739 i hope beyonce advises him not to beef with me because im dangerous
5376740 im young and im stupid im disrespectful and it gets ugly man every time somebody lyrically bleeds somehow i havent lost a beef jay has nas did it in one song
5376741 i got a whole coast to back me my coast will turn their backs on whoever im beefing with
5376742 so basically let me commit suicide because im the only cat thatll commit suicide and then resurrect every time for jay to say that about me its cool cause thats jay z and im just little ole game but if you f with me imma turn into a beast and ill rip your head off bust your lips and turn the roc a fella sign to a pee stain

5376744 the inspiration for c o r e comes from the teams love of the classic early video games like doom quake and half life these incredible games have that great combination of skilful and addictive gameplay which we have now re created for the nintendo ds c o r e is essentially 2 games in one the single player mission is spread over 15 huge levels and the multiplayer across 10 specially designed arenas
5376745 and im sure johnny cash would have been a john mccain supporter if he was still around
5376746 it is appalling to me that people still want to invoke my fathers name five years after his death to ascribe beliefs ideals values and loyalties to him that cannot possibly be determined and to try to further their own agendas by doing so
5376747 i knew my father pretty well at least better than some of those who entitle themselves to his legacy and his supposed ideals and even i would not presume to say publicly what i know he thought or felt
5376748 this is especially dangerous in the case of political affiliation it is unfair and presumptuous to use him to bolster any platform i would ask that my father not be co opted in this election for either side since he is clearly not here to defend or state his own allegiance

5376809 i love your blog you must be an outstanding person
5376810 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
5376811 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
5376812 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
5376813 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
5376814 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
5376815 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a 1 in 3 chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
5376816 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
5376817 its kind of a weird process if you stop and think about it
5376818 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
5376819 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
5376820 we confront more than the usual number of people who dont respond or cant respond people are away from their homes heading back from summer vacation or preparing their children for the start of the school year
5376821 id have to say that monckton won the debate he came across as more prepared and had answers at his fingertips whereas richard appeared to verbally stumble on occasion
5376822 i got the impression that littlemore was engaging in the debate totally unprepared
5376823 oh my this is very confusing no wonder the government says its too early to take action
5376824 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
5376825 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
5376826 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
5376827 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect

5376839 its extremely sad and pathetic how the whole case was handled
5376840 what kind of office is this when they take in millions of dollars of estate money every year and yet they cant pay out a penny

5376852 we had 50 people register with us last night we had a mixture of tourists and local residents

5376854 preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion
5376855 tornadoes are likely in some areas tonight monday and tomorrow and maybe even into the next few days
5376856 lets then start thinking negotiating how can we prevent the definitive estrangement of our two countries
5376857 but well see the madison is the hardest of the lot you can have a crash early anything can happen
5376858 well be strong were world champions we just have to play it right and make sure we dont lose a lap early on like we did at the world championships
5376859 i havent even touched my madison bike since the worlds so i better get that out of the bag
5376860 cav woke me up this morning just messing around the apartment and making noise hes running around like a schoolkid but hes up for it
5376861 well have a gameplan going into it but well be ready firing for gold
5376862 were doing 70km h there in the team pursuit theres not many people who are going to go faster than that in the madison
5376863 were pretty excited about finishing pool play undefeated and getting onto the medal round
5376864 we are healthy i think the team has played well and we are very excited about getting into the medal round it is time to win a gold medal
5376865 i just had to get myself going running the floor and getting deep in the paint and going right into the shot and being a big presence for the team
5376866 what we have seen is they us play extremely hard on the defensive end they are very unselfish they always find the open guy and they also shot the three point very well
5376867 when they have these three things great defense share the ball and shoot the ball well they are unbeatable
5376868 were in a tournament and now we get to play the best team in the world and have a swing at the big dog im confident we are going to go out there and play ball
5376869 japan played very well they forced us to play the way we did and the good part about that is the way they knock it around and even though they scored first we stayed focused and we believed in what we were doing
5376870 we bounced back we dont have one star we have 18 it is a great feeling with these players on and off the pitch
5376871 we all knew we had to pick it up the team concentration is awesome and its all coming together
5376872 we lost to the usa four years ago in athens so we prepared for four years
5376873 although we lost tonight we made it into the top four which took us 10 years we lost tonight but we will maintain our dream of beating the usa
5376874 for thousands of years school has been primarily dedicated to the education of the left hemisphere children enter school with more balance between their left and right hemispheres than when they graduate they begin kindergarten with a vivid imagination that expresses itself in their block play their pretend games and their dress up corner by first grade they are taught that playing is something they do at recess in organized games and school is where they work children with good phonemic awareness who learn to read on schedule by the phonetic approach employed in most primary grades are considered good students children who struggle with reading often develop poor self esteem
5376875 in the time of your life live so that in that wondrous time you shall not add to the misery and sorrow of the world but shall smile to the infinite variety and mystery ive been having great fun painting big it is really my preference to work on a large scale but as i am slightly packaging challenged i decided to get some smaller wooden panels i didthis with the intent of putting the finished pieces in my etsy store which has been forlornly empty for far far too long and i needed some variety i needed a break from the painting style of the last week and so on saturday i got some lovely poplar and cut it down to about 5 5
5376876 no one at these games could remember a 100m race where they have seen such a picture
5376877 normally the snapshot is a blur of profiles crossing the line
5376878 obviously from the race he can go faster than the 9 69 he was having fun in the last 20m celebrating and breaking the world record thats awesome you can read into it he can probably go under 9 60 but i am not good at predictions i just love to see things unfold
5376879 and captains of work must always be but there is a wide difference between being captains of work and taking the profits of it
5376880 even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too
5376881 so are you saying that were all just like really excellent sheep
5376882 they were all our first choices everyone said yes which is so rare
5376883 our motto has been get the story right get the facts right tell it honestly
5376884 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5376885 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5376886 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5376887 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5376888 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america

5376890 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
5376891 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
5376892 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
5376893 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
5376894 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground

5376901 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
5376902 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
5376903 a remarkable indictment of the corruption and cynicism rife among climate scientists

5376909 few seem to realise that the present ipcc models predict almost unanimously that by 2040 the average summer in europe will be as hot as the summer of 2003 when over 30 000 died from heat by then we may cool ourselves with air conditioning and learn to live in a climate no worse than that of baghdad now but without extensive irrigation the plants will die and both farming and natural ecosystems will be replaced by scrub and desert what will there be to eat

5376925 there was slow progress over the last decade and youre now seeing this tipping point
5376926 it could have been done in a different way and things wouldnt have gotten so heated

5376940 no representa en ninguno de sus aspectos lo que el fallecido diputado juan bustos fue en su vida principalmente en la defensa de los derechos humanos y la dignidad de las personas
5376941 consideramos una ofensa a la memoria del diputado bustos que su reemplazante sea un hombre que no cuenta con caracter sticas que lo hagan merecedor para continuar la labor de un hombre que dedic su vida a la defensa de lo justo con la sencillez que poseen los grandes hombres de la historia
5376942 queremos ser claras y decir que para nuestra organizaci n la presencia de schilling en el parlamento es una bofetada a la dignidad y a la historia es un contrasentido y una injusticia que no podemos morigerar con frases ret ricas porque estar amos faltando a la verdad
5376943 lamentamos tambi n y profundamente que no sea el diputado sergio aguil quien asuma la presidencia de la c mara de diputados porque el s representa los valores de juan bustos y habr a sido un orgullo para el mundo de los derechos humanos contar con su presencia en esa investidura consientes de que ning n cargo minar su trayectoria ni alterar su conducta recta leal y de principios

5376948 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance

5376979 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5376980 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5376981 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5376982 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5376983 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5376984 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5376985 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5376986 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5376987 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5376988 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5376989 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5376990 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush

5376999 large international retailers offer online buyers local shipping options that guarantee timely delivery of orders at ground shipping rates
5377000 the largest online retailers don t ship all orders from one central warehouse they diversify inventory globally across multiple warehouses and ship orders from the warehouse closest to the end customer
5377001 we knew our products would sell well in canada we didn t want to miss the fall riding season and certainly couldn t miss the 2008 holiday sales season we worked with shipwire to get inventory moved into canada when we launched a customized canadian site for our

5377018 our three defensive tackles played the best scrimmage that theyve had victor thomas took a big step
5377019 the challenge for victor is to continue that and be consistent and be mentally and physically tough all the time
5377020 it was good to see ahmad paige take a little bit of a step for us

5377030 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
5377031 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
5377032 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch

5377053 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
5377054 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon

5377056 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
5377057 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
5377058 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
5377059 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
5377060 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
5377061 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
5377062 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
5377063 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
5377064 just so you all know we did set a record
5377065 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
5377066 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
5377067 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
5377068 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
5377069 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
5377070 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
5377071 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
5377072 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
5377073 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
5377074 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
5377075 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
5377076 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
5377077 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5377078 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5377079 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5377080 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5377081 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5377082 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5377083 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5377084 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
5377085 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
5377086 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
5377087 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
5377088 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
5377089 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source

5377091 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
5377092 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
5377093 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
5377094 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
5377095 theyre just normal people on the other end of the line

5377109 the 9 11 attacks were not planned and executed for the sole purpose of justifying a war first and foremost
5377110 with regard to planting wmds i have no idea probably because they felt they didnt need to having sold wmds to saddam sometime earlier
5377111 well they lied to us about iraq whos to say theyre not lying about 9 11
5377112 its irrelevant really because it doesnt change the possibility or impossibility of the us governments explanation for 9 11
5377113 well they lied to us about iraq whos to say theyre not lying about 9 11
5377114 nevermind the whole thing about how ridiculous it is to think that a jumbo jet can do more damage than a truck bomb

5377120 you need more than fire to make a buidling turn into melted steel and dust
5377121 it is hard to argue with facts hence the 911 truth movement
5377122 think fulcrum point laws of momentum and path of least resistance
5377123 9 11 makes sense if you dont know about the laws of nature
5377124 disintergrate into dust and melted steel at the same time offering no resistance to the anvil as my body disintegrates
5377125 it is hard to argue with facts hence the 911 truth movement
5377126 to the best of our knowledge little was known about the effects of a fire from such an aircraft and no designs were prepared for that circumstance indeed at that time no fireproofing systems were available to control the effects of such fires
5377127 there were only two problems the first of course was that no study of the impact of a 600 mile an hour plane ever existed thats got nothing to do with the reality of what we did robertson snapped when shown the port authority architects statement more than three decades later the second problem was that no one thought to take into account the fires that would inevitably break out when the jetliners fuel exploded exactly as the had and if wien was the trade centers cassandra fire protection would become its achilles heel
5377128 if you talk to a real muslim he would quickly tell you how bullshit the whole bin laden thing is most real muslims believe that bin laden is a cia agent
5377129 dont expect the rest of the world to not call you a naive child though
5377130 it is hard to argue with facts hence the 911 truth movement
5377131 the way he was acting it would be hard for me to believe it was anything but suicide
5377132 its unusual in a suicide case to have two shots
5377133 but it has been done in the past and it is in fact a distinct possibility
5377134 it is hard to argue with facts hence the 911 truth movement
5377135 just think of this one tiny aspect of it the government murdered 3000 people but then could not bring itself to murder 3 losers
5377136 i am not going to sit around and waste my time watching some piece of propaganda i would not send you to watch orielly as proof of anything so spare me some silly piece of trash that you ran across that you believe because it holds up your rigid belief system
5377137 not at all correct in fact it is the weight of all the evidence that supports what actually happened that day is the reason i believe it
5377138 you have yet to provide any sort of evidence to back up your claims i have the weight of the scientific community behind me who do you have
5377139 but this government that you accused of murdering 3000 people balked at committing 3 more murders is that what you are saying
5377140 the real menace of our republic is this invisible government which like a giant octopus sprawls its slimy length over city state and nation it seizes in its long and powerful tentacles our executive officers our legislative bodies our schools our courts our newspapers and every agency created for the public protection
5377141 to depart from mere generalizations let me say that at the head of this octopus are the rockefeller standard oil interest and a small group of powerful banking houses generally referred to as the international bankers the little coterie of powerful international bankers virtually run the united states government for their own selfish purposes
5377142 they practically control both parties write political platforms make catspaws of party leaders use the leading men of private organizations and resort to every device to place in nomination for high public office only such candidates as will be amenable to the dictates of corrupt big business
5377143 these international bankers and rockefeller standard oil interests control the majority of the newspapers and magazines in this country they use the columns of these papers to club into submission or drive out of office public officials who refuse to do the bidding of the powerful corrupt cliques which compose the invisible government
5377144 there will be in the next generation or so a pharmacological method of making people love their servitude and producing dictatorship without tears so to speak producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them but will rather enjoy it because they will be distracted from any desire to rebel by propaganda or brainwashing or brainwashing enhanced by pharmacological methods and this seems to be the final revolution
5377145 to depart from mere generalizations let me say that at the head of this octopus are the rockefeller standard oil interest and a small group of powerful banking houses generally referred to as the international bankers the little coterie of powerful international bankers virtually run the united states government for their own selfish purposes
5377146 i volunteered at the al addan hospital while i was there i saw the iraqi soldiers come into the hospital with guns and go into the room where babies were in incubators they took the babies out of the incubators took the incubators and left the babies on the cold floor to die
5377147 none had more impact on american public opinion than the one about iraqi soldiers removing 312 babies from their incubators and leaving them to die on the cold hospital floors of kuwait city
5377148 for more than a century ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well publicized incidents such as my encounter with castro to attack the rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over american political and economic institutions some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the united states characterizing my family and me as internationalists and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure one world if you will if that is the charge i stand guilty and i am proud of it
5377149 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill
5377150 evolution is one of the most studied one of the most proven theories of science
5377151 there is a difference though between that idea and the notion that they went through some ultra complicated plot that involved thousands upon thousands of people to pull off one of the most needlessly pointless operations in history for no real concrete purpose
5377152 i think we need an explanation why 14 pages are missing cuz i think we need to know what they were

5377160 and you who were already conquered in your greatest victories what will you be in the approaching defeat
5377161 i hope that my wearing the hijood sports top will inspire other women to see that modesty or religious beliefs dont have to be a barrier to participating in competitive sports
5377162 i cant imagine that the decision is going to allow people to get their money back quickly
5377163 if it did that would be great but there are a number of people who wont be getting money back
5377164 its a thunderclap both for pakistan and its foreign supporters
5377165 the one thing the two had in common was their opposition to musharraf
5377166 a lot of pakistanis feel he is not fit to be president or prime minister of pakistan until these allegations are finally cleared up
5377167 now that hes gone they will be accountable to whats happening
5377168 theres going to be a lot of change now in pakistans policies both internally and towards afghanistan
5377169 a fight against pashtun tribesmen along the north west frontier of pakistan who are supportive of their pashtun first cousins in afghanistan
5377170 it think with all of its other troubles islamist militants in the tribal areas secessionists in baluchistan the last thing the government would want to do is stir the pot in kashmir
5377171 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5377172 he could either fight the impeachment which would damage pakistan or he could go and try to save as much honour as he could
5377173 it may be a very difficult and bitter fight for zardari
5377174 there is no way my baby is losing an organ because someone else is sick

5377192 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
5377193 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
5377194 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5377195 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5377196 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5377197 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5377198 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5377199 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5377200 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5377201 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5377202 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5377203 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5377204 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5377205 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5377206 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt

5377208 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5377209 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5377210 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5377211 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5377212 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5377213 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion

5377215 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5377216 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5377217 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5377218 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5377219 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5377220 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5377221 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5377222 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5377223 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5377224 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5377225 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
5377226 the new challenge we have is that for approximately five years the plan which is a very bad plan but is the only plan that nasa and the administration and congress have approved is to be dependent on the russian soyuz vehicle to get people to and from the international space station
5377227 and so now with the political realities with russia invading georgia we have a new wrinkle thrown in

5377237 there is information that six of blackwater security guards have been accused of murdering 17 iraqi civilians and are to be prosecuted in washington

5377263 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
5377264 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
5377265 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
5377266 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
5377267 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
5377268 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature

5377270 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
5377271 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
5377272 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
5377273 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
5377274 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5377275 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5377276 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh

5377279 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5377280 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5377281 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5377282 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5377283 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5377284 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5377285 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5377286 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
5377287 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
5377288 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here

5377293 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years

5377295 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
5377296 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
5377297 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
5377298 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now

5377324 a new book by the author ron suskind claims that the white house ordered the cia to forge a back dated handwritten letter from the head of iraqi intelligence to saddam hussein

5377340 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
5377341 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year

5377463 paul maloney has a lot on his plate if he could just keep his mind on his job hed be a lot better off fortunately for the reader he doesnt whats obvious right off the bat is that this novel is written by an accomplished stylist as it turns out anne brooke is also a poet which makes for a charming read but you may not have time to stop to appreciate that fact because the action sweeps you up from the word go the characters are compelling theres nothing like a sexy morally ambiguous irresistible charmer to stir up the intrigue which brooke has ably created with maloneys nemesis his ex lover dominic who practically spits sex and the plot is razor edge gripping foreign intrigue theres one incredibly harrowing scene where brookes descriptive powers come to the fore though with a little deep breathing you can make it through intact a good read a fun ride

5377466 instead of taking a critical journalistic approach to this spin andrea mitchell did what has become a pattern for her of simply repeating obama campaign talking points

5377514 la lucha reci n se inicia tengan por seguro que vamos a ganar
5377515 no veo mucha novedad los resultados nos dicen que no cambia el escenario el presidente se ha fortalecido y los prefectos de la oposici n tambi n
5377516 las dos partes en conflicto el presidente evo morales y los prefectos autonomistas han ganado s lo que unos m s que otros es decir globalmente los porcentajes a favor de los autonomistas son mayores que los obtenidos por el presidente
5377517 los resultados del refer ndum revocatorio eran previsibles aunque sin duda alguna la votaci n del presidente morales en t rminos cuantitativos ha superado todas las expectativas pero en t rminos estructurales la situaci n previa al refer ndum se mantiene intacta el oriente del pa s santa cruz tarija beni y pando est muy firmemente en contra de morales y el occidente la paz oruro cochabamba y potos muy a favor de l
5377518 el resultado da mucha fuerza al presidente y a los prefectos que promueven la autonom a el gobierno dec a que un apoyo mayoritario iba a significar un respaldo al proyecto de constituci n y que el paso siguiente era convocar al refer ndum constitucional si lo hace se enfrentar con las regiones donde su apoyo electoral ha disminuido en resumen ser un error si evo cree que con el 67 de apoyo puede ir al refer ndum por la nueva constituci n y si la oposici n regional cree que puede poner en vigencia sus estatutos
5377519 he pedido a algunos prefectos que entendamos el pedido del pueblo boliviano que es el de las transformaciones en democracia y esas transformaciones en democracia hay que llevarlas durante el di logo pero no solamente prefectos y presidente sino tambi n los distintos sectores
5377520 haremos todas las acciones para cumplir con el mandato popular auton mico
5377521 una jugada deleznable habida cuenta que l evo morales sab a que los gobernadores ten an previsto reunirse el mi rcoles 13 as que me parece que es una invitaci n a la que se sabe que no se va a asistir
5377522 la concertaci n pasa por una revisi n del proyecto de constituci n del mas al igual que los proyectos de estatutos auton micos para integrar y as tener el pacto social de unidad y de integraci n de los bolivianos
5377523 las posiciones se radicalizar n m s y como se han estado viendo escaramuzas sas se har n m s frecuentes y probablemente llegue un momento en el que una de las partes crea que deba asestar el golpe final me temo que ser el gobierno el que se vea tentado a hacer esto enga ado por el espejismo del resultado del refer ndum
5377524 en el fondo el pa s ha ratificado su polarizaci n el pr ximo paso es convencerse de que ambos gobierno y autonomistas son fuertes y que no pueden vencerse y como no pueden vencerse est n condenados a entenderse de otra manera pueden perder los dos se necesitan y tienen la obligaci n de ponerse de acuerdo
5377525 el gran error de evo morales es el de no haber acaudillado l mismo el movimiento auton mico
5377526 no le interesa saber a qu partido pertenecen los prefectos o alcaldes lo que me interesa es que ejecuten r pidamente lo decidido por el gobierno nacional
5377527 no se puede disociar el desarrollo de la poblaci n ind gena del desarrollo nacional pese a lo que quiere hacernos creer la ret rica radical nuestras poblaciones en su conjunto comprenden que su progreso est ligado al del pa s y est n dispuestos a trabajar en beneficio de ambos

5377670 the twin engined aircraft struck the light aircraft and just totally destroyed it

5377695 it is invaluable to have an independent monitor who can swiftly question any adverse drug reactions or differences in illness and death rates between groups taking part in the clinical trials
5377696 parents also need to be made aware of the risks of adverse drug reactions when a child takes any medicine so that they can make informed decisions that balance those risks against the possible benefits the drug may provide their child
5377697 there is general agreement by pediatric health professionals regulatory authorities and the pharmaceutical industry as well as politicians and parents that drug trials are essential in order to improve drug therapies
5377698 we are calling for all pediatric drug trials to include independent safety monitoring committees to ensure that this vital work is carried out in a way that minimizes risks and maximizes benefits for the children taking part
5377699 this is a very grave scandal for the university and the pressure on the public prosecutor to bring criminal charges will be very high

5377717 the foreign ministrys crisis team is engaged in working toward a solution in close contact with the afghan authorities
5377718 the us administration plays a funny anti taliban game and pretends that a super power is unable to defeat a small marginalized and medieval minded gang which is actually her own product but our people found by experience in the past few years that the us doesnt want to defeat the taliban and al qaeda because then they will have no excuse to stay in afghanistan and work towards the realization of its economical political and strategic interests in the region

5377722 if the fight was important enough i think i could just get down to 12 stone 7lbs
5377723 but if a big fight was presented to me like a chad dawson even the winner of kelly pavlik or bernard hopkins and there was enough money on the table yes i might take the chance
5377724 i might take the risk but at the moment i am a cruiserweight and i want to clean up the cruiserweights
5377725 but never say never if i get a big offer and something meaningful on the table id definitely think about it

5377739 its still quite inspiring that a nation like jamaica would even consider making a bid
5377740 i was speaking to a couple of players yesterday theres a lot of uncertainty and there always seems to be these big decisions to be made
5377741 it is an important time for cricket everyone has identified that players and administrators
5377742 but as was the case throughout my career you just take the advice of the experts in the security field and thats what ca and the players association are continuing to do and the players would trust that opinion i have no doubt about that
5377743 the important issue now is for us to work with the icc we are not in the business of going to players and asking their answers prior to us making a decision
5377744 i work very closely with paul marsh the australian cricketers association chief executive and individual players from time to time but we are not deliberately interfering with the players preparation at the moment until we have got something to tell them
5377745 our view is quite simply we need now to see where the icc choose to go with this im sure they will come back to us in the next few days as always we are working with all of our parties and that decision will play itself out in due course
5377746 the icc are the ones who are in control of both the detail and the possible alternative venue so im sure we all understand that its their position now
5377747 its still quite inspiring that a nation like jamaica would even consider making a bid
5377748 the players put on the field what we did with them in training we realised more than the other games in pre season what we need to do
5377749 but well need more quality in the future if we want to win the premier league or champions league well need more than this
5377750 lampard is not brazilian hes english but he touched the ball very well it was his style
5377751 the same with ballack we have a style its impossible to say to deco foul people thats not his style
5377752 i only give the players the freedom to play and allow them to express their style this is a chelsea performance not a scolari performance
5377753 its still quite inspiring that a nation like jamaica would even consider making a bid
5377754 we are impressed by deep commitment to maritime traditions at atlantic challenge and very excited about the opportunities for our students
5377755 it is significant that the after school sailing program is the first partnership we present to community youth under the rasa partnership
5377756 broadreach and sad 5 began their collaboration more than a year ago to increase youth involvement in unique area offerings such as those out of atlantic challenge
5377757 turkey keeps international law but as long as there isnt been any final decision over the warrant or any unambiguous mandate we see no need to act
5377758 no entiendo por qu per no aprovecha la fecha fifa para disputar un partido amistoso que servir a de preparaci n a los jugadores de cara al encuentro contra venezuela y argentina selecciones que est n por encima de nosotros en la tabla de posiciones de las eliminatorias
5377759 si mallqui y r os se han aferrado al cargo como miembros de la comisi n y no han querido renunciar es porque tienen la intenci n de trabajar por la selecci n y creo que no lo han hecho es lamentable que per llegue en desventaja ya que como peruano espero que se alcance un triunfo
5377760 ahora que estoy fuera de la comisi n me he abocado a mi trabajo en el cienciano que hoy marcha como l der del torneo clausura y apunta a ser el campe n la selecci n albirroja est en manos de otros dirigentes que deber n trabajar duro para lograr la tan anhelada clasificaci n al mundial
5377761 me alegra realmente que alva y guisasola hayan sido llamados a la selecci n se han ganado limpiamente su convocatoria porque est n haciendo un buen papel en cienciano
5377762 se est acercando al momento de tener que decidir si echamos el cierre
5377763 no van a apoyar a una compa a cuyo modelo de negocio se ha roto as que si no nos acercamos a una soluci n estamos acabados

5377768 we knew that we needed to win this race and more in order to close down valentinos advantage so this makes the championship very difficult for us
5377769 anything can happen in racing but 50 points is a big gap against such a strong and consistent competitor
5377770 anyway i never throw in the towel nor does anybody at ducati and we will keep fighting until the end
5377771 misano is a home race for the factory and there will be lots of ducatisti there so my main thought now is to stay positive and bounce back with a good show for them in two weeks time
5377772 obviously we are all disappointed with this result because our pace in practice was good everything went very well this morning and we felt we could push out in front
5377773 i was doing the same lap time over and over and i was quite happy with the pace i was running
5377774 the crash came out of the blue that corner was an easy one but i lost the front and it happened very quickly very suddenly and i didnt manage to save it
5377775 its a hard one to explain and we will look at the data but sometimes this kind of crash happens at this level of racing and it was my mistake
5377776 id carefully prepared for a difficult duel with stoner which the first laps of the race confirmed
5377777 but i have to say as well that my motorcycle was running perfectly and allowed me to ride very calmly towards victory
5377778 its still quite inspiring that a nation like jamaica would even consider making a bid

5377789 they are one of the biggest packs in the world and that in itself is a challenge
5377790 theres cj van der linde and i think the beast tendai mtawarira will be playing so thats going to be a big battle for us and how we can step up and improve
5377791 being consistent in our set pieces and making sure we get that right but also just bringing the aggression up right from the start
5377792 they are passionate at home and theyve got passionate supporters so if we get on top of them early then that will set us up for a good game
5377793 my first test was at ellis park in johannesburg in 2006 it was a huge shock it was a bit of a wake up call for me
5377794 i was playing club rugby about three weeks beforehand and then i was in front of 70 000 screaming south africans at altitude
5377795 for a front rower your scrummaging is your number one focus so ive been working really hard on that with wallabies set piece coach michael foley
5377796 thats been my goal just keep my scrummaging going and if anything else comes for me its an added bonus
5377797 technically the all blacks are probably the best scrummaging team in the world at the moment the springboks are right up there
5377798 its still quite inspiring that a nation like jamaica would even consider making a bid
5377799 this camp is good opportunity for us to see the players after their off season break
5377800 most of the players have just started or are about to start their respective domestic competitions and we can now start focusing of the world cup qualifiers which are just around the corner
5377801 its still quite inspiring that a nation like jamaica would even consider making a bid
5377802 im very happy to be number one but the feeling doesnt change too much because the last years i did very well too
5377803 i was very happy being the number two so finally im number one for sure theres satisfaction but at the same time i dont know i dont have time to celebrate i play new york in one week
5377804 its still quite inspiring that a nation like jamaica would even consider making a bid
5377805 we try to have a bit more of an even balance and normally we do so hopefully we can keep that a little bit more even
5377806 we probably dont use mark williams anywhere near enough as well
5377807 were not going to win enough games of footy with stats like 17 and one
5377808 were a team orientated team and hes franklin doing the right thing
5377809 its not his fault were kicking it to him so much its our fault for making the wrong decisions going inside 50
5377810 maybe we play him up the ground a little bit to try to take him out of that zone to make us a little bit less buddy conscious
5377811 we had our best side out there and we just werent good enough to get the points
5377812 so were going to have to improve our form and individually were going to have to get better if were going to go all right in the finals
5377813 its still quite inspiring that a nation like jamaica would even consider making a bid
5377814 we can now start focusing on the world cup qualifiers which are just around the corner verbeek said
5377815 with that in mind we will be looking to try a few different things in the match against south africa on tuesday night
5377816 its still quite inspiring that a nation like jamaica would even consider making a bid
5377817 i said to the group i want to see the side evolve when it is not going their way
5377818 i spoke about climbing over the mountain when it gets a little bit tough to get out of situations finding out about each other
5377819 i thought at times the players were not demanding enough of each other when st kilda were just kicking the ball around
5377820 that results in uncontested marks and an easy path to goals
5377821 as i said to the group after the game look no further than yourself ask yourself what happened and what can be the difference in performance from one week to the next
5377822 the game is not that difficult from a basic thing like manning up when they have got the ball
5377823 at times you are not going to finish up on your direct opponent but it is how you cover for each other
5377824 its still quite inspiring that a nation like jamaica would even consider making a bid

5377826 la vecindad del chavo no valdr medio centavo pero es linda de verdad
5377827 the injury didnt do me any favours i had about a month off
5377828 its all been about finding my feet again and i felt the few weeks before the st george game i was doing that
5377829 its also been about getting a combination with locky lockyer
5377830 its been a bit of a different situation with locky back and us trying to work on our combination
5377831 when he lockyer wasnt there i just had to do it but now i have to pick my times and work in with him
5377832 theyre key positions too hodgo is a big strike weapon for us and we missed ks hunt creativity around the ruck and his combination with locky
5377833 its still quite inspiring that a nation like jamaica would even consider making a bid

5377837 in an utopian world the perfect dividend stock would be one that is both high yield and provide a high dividend growth rate its share price would appreciate ratable with its increasing dividend all of this would be driven by increasing earnings and cash flow ok so much for my fantasies the perfect dividend stock just may be a balanced compromise
5377838 even though our gymnasts look scarily similar thats the pretty one
5377839 we will write a letter to the minister of transport to call a summit on the brt
5377840 if the summit is not arranged within 14 days they will see that we are not simply taxi operators but that we know our constitutional rights
5377841 that conflict will not only delay actual implementation but will also incur costs that could have been avoided by doing the right thing from the beginning
5377842 were the largest mode of public transport in the country but the government does not consider us as a critical stakeholder when considering a project of this degree its worrying said taaibosch
5377843 with that attitude government is simply disempowering the taxi industry
5377844 because of the great emphasis on harmony and family integration in many asian cultures family conflict is an important factor to consider when studying suicidal behaviors among asian americans
5377845 our study suggests that we need to more precisely determine the kinds of family conflicts that are associated with suicide risk among asian americans and find means of preventing these family problems
5377846 this is the first nationally representative investigation of family conflict and suicidal behaviors among asian americans
5377847 our findings suggest that high family conflict has an independent and additive effect in predicting lifetime suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts among asian americans
5377848 up to 2 4 percent of the u s population self identifies as mixed race and most of these individuals describe themselves as biracial
5377849 we cannot underestimate the importance of understanding the social psychological and experiential differences that may increase the likelihood of psychological disorders among this fast growing segment of the population
5377850 the large number of children coming into contact with the legal system mostly as a result of abuse cases has motivated intense scientific effort to understand childrens true and false reports
5377851 the seriousness of abuse charges and the frequency with which childrens testimony provides central prosecutorial evidence makes childrens eyewitness memory abilities important considerations arguably even more important however are adults abilities to evaluate childrens reports
5377852 the findings suggest that adults are better at detecting false reports than they are at detecting false denials
5377853 while accurately detecting false reports protects innocent people from false allegations the failure to detect false denials could mean that adults fail to protect children who falsely deny actual victimization

5377855 the matric pupil was carrying a ninja type sword and was wearing a balaclava over his face and had smeared his face with black paint after stabbing the 16 year old pupil he stabbed a gardener in the face and hit another on the back
5377856 another pupil who saw this happening suffered an asthma attack
5377857 he was very calm when we arrested him in the staff room
5377858 let us be very honest for a change no one dare challenge me when i say that if zuma was not implicated in fraud and corruption we would not have this kind of debate today
5377859 sa has become an example on the african continent and the southern african development community region as a nation that upholds the rule of law and uprooting corrupt practices by those who are connected to influential public servants and politicians

5377893 the new challenge we have is that for approximately five years the plan which is a very bad plan but is the only plan that nasa and the administration and congress have approved is to be dependent on the russian soyuz vehicle to get people to and from the international space station
5377894 and so now with the political realities with russia invading georgia we have a new wrinkle thrown in
5377895 and we also want people to know that we did this before our show
5377896 like if it wasnt a show that would have been going on in our house anyway
5377897 youre just getting a peak behind what wouldve been going on anyway
5377898 cause theres a lot of stuff in there that you dont know
5377899 and if youre taking them back where you taking them from youre taking them back from drugs youre taking them back from gangs youre taking them from the wrong relationships when your taking back something it takes an action family just dont fall into place family is something that has to be nurtured and worked on and a lot of people work hard at other competitive things but you know what if you put that same energy into your family youll have a nice family it takes energy it takes work family just dont fall in place
5377900 a family that plays together stays together a family that prays together stays together but really when you look at our family on tv whats attracting people is the fun that we have the respect that we have the love that we have its not so much the toys or the cars or stuff like that people are attracted to the fact that were a family that loves each other and it looks fun when things look fun people want to get involved with that
5377901 and we just want people to try and take some of the things that weve done cause it works for us and we pray that it works for other people like meetings and all those different things and we hope that they get a lot out of it
5377902 shes trying to and im trying to get things in order
5377903 shes always looking to expand and im always looking to consolidate and make things work out cause i gotta keep an eye on everything but i gotta admit that adopting miley has been the biggest blessing in my life

5377907 we need action for action and what we require right now is that verification package from north korea before we can go forward with the delisting
5377908 north koreans have obligations under the six party framework that includes not only the united states but other countries we are all waiting for that verification package
5377909 to just say i dont know on the most divisive issue in america is not a clear enough answer for me
5377910 if an evangelical really believes that the bible is literal in other word s in psalm 139 god says i formed you in your mothers womb and before you were born i planned every day of your life if they believe thats literally true then they cant just walk away from that they can add other issues but they cant walk away from the belief that at conception god planned that child and to abort it would be to short circuit the purpose
5377911 adapted to be perhaps less offensive or less exclusive maybe more culturally popular or easy to embrace
5377912 when in fact by doing that pastor warren threatens to neutralize the very message of the gospel
5377913 whenever you set out to make the gospel more palatable more easily embraced you always risk reducing the gospel to something other than the message that jesus lived and proclaimed and died for

5377919 the current market conditions have certainly had an impact on the lending market and as a result more and more buyers and operators are seeking specialist independent advice rather than remaining loyal to their existing lender

5378168 i cannot in good conscience support a tax cut in which so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate among us at the expense of middle class americans who need tax relief
5378169 i think the worst thing we can do right now weve got some shaky economic times is to increase peoples taxes and i think that what we need is more tax cuts we need to make bush tax cuts permanent we need to get rid of the amt we need to cut corporate taxes we need to give people reasons to write off and depreciate their business investments and equipment investments

5378184 senator mccain did you give the information the viet cong wanted when they were torturing you over that five year period and assuming you did not then why do you think that our probably more humane methods would be any more effective in extracting the information we want from the detainees
5378185 the soldiers took me into an empty cell set me down on the floor still on the stretcher and placed a blanket over me for the next few days i drifted in and out of consciousness my interrogators accused me of being a war criminal and demanded military information they knocked me around a little and i began to feel sharp pains in my fractured limbs i blacked out after the first few blows i thought if i could hold out they would relent and take me to a hospital but on the fourth day i realised my condition had become more serious i was feverish and losing consciousness for longer periods

5378187 is that while it would be nice if he decided he felt honor bound to stay within the system and take the money if he did so i might join a group of people who sued him for political malpractice when you have the ability to raise the kind of money that he could raise and do it without selling your soul to spend all the time between now and the election on fundraisers your goal is to win an election and not turn your back on the people voting there will be outraged editorials and mccain will be justifiably pissed but it was pragmatically the right decision for him to make
5378188 there is moral high ground in politics news to me
5378189 most of that anti obama hate is left over from the dem on dem mudslinging from the hillary clinton times
5378190 like john mccain i am opposed to such torture my point was that the nvc was not trying to get information they were just torturing for the fun of it and in attempts to create terror

5378235 the united states is in no way founded upon the christian religion
5378236 i have examined all the known superstitions of the world and i do not find in our particular superstition of christianity one redeeming feature they are all alike founded on fables and mythology millions of innocent men women and children since the introduction of christianity have been burnt tortured fined and imprisoned what has been the effect of this coercion to make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites to support roguery and error all over the earth

5378242 for 10 of the last 11 weeks weve sustained less than 200 attacks per week nationwide
5378243 it is undeniable that iraq is in a much better place than it was several months ago
5378244 an increasingly effective iraqi security force one that is growing in capability and in confidence
5378245 and as a result we have seen signs of hope and prosperity return to many parts of the country that were once previously threatened by criminals and terrorists and others who dont want iraq to achieve its full potential
5378246 were making progress in each of these areas every day
5378247 and while these efforts are progressing at a different pace they all are moving forward in a positive and tangible manner
5378248 today the multinational corps iraq is operating in more areas of the country with fewer troops and our security gains continue to trend in a positive direction even after the redeployment of five brigade combat teams and most recently the georgia brigade
5378249 in the north al qaida is in disarray and its capability to conduct well planned and coordinated attacks is limited but they still pose a real threat to the population
5378250 and a couple of weeks ago i walked through an open market in mosul that was several kilometers long and it was overflowing with iraqis
5378251 now thats something that would not have been possible just a couple of months ago and this is a clear sign that we are making progress indeed
5378252 suicide vests which are a trademark of al qaida account for less than 3 percent of the total number of all of attacks but they account for 65 percent of all casualties
5378253 so you can see that while al qaida is in disarray they are still capable of ruthless attacks
5378254 as a result of the improved security in places like basra and amarah were seeing fewer numbers of lethal accelerants making their way into baghdad
5378255 today these militias are largely disrupted and ineffective because of iraqi operations and because the people have turned against them
5378256 absolutely impressed with the commitment and the professionalism of our soldiers sailors airmen and marines
5378257 their hard work continues to have a positive impact on the lives of the iraqis
5378258 theres still much work to be done but were making steady progress every day

5378261 def jam doesnt fund rihanna properly so marc uses the money rihanna makes from third party endorsements and from tours to fund her album and music videos
5378262 i dont want to disrespect marcs name he is a fantastic manager and genuinely believes in rihanna but he uses her money to fund her future projects because he believes he can break her in the world market her album sales are not nearly as close to her single sales and he knows that if she is only known as a singles artist she will only be as good as her last hit unfortunately he didnt inform his client and im receiving the brunt of it
5378263 then came for the repackaging of her album good girl gone bad which is called good girl gone bad reloaded that entire project was funded through rihannas money take a bow was bought through her money the video was created with her money and so is her most recent video and single disturbia the label didnt even want to pay a dime for anything close to 750 000 was spent on those two songs alone and now she expects to see money in her account

5378274 lets be honest with each other it would be disastrous choice because first of all its going to alienate many people in the republican party particularly the conservative pro life pro family base
5378275 look i like joe lieberman and i would join with many others who would say that if john mccain picked him to be secretary of state or secretary of defense or put him in the cabinet thats fine but vice president you know republicans want to elect a republican president and that means if something happens to the president theyd still want a republican on the job joe lieberman would not be somebody that i think most republicans would jump up and dance up in the aisles over in minneapolis

5378360 the tender was not successful whether it expires is meaningless
5378361 ea could have continued the tender for another month but they didnt only 15 percent of the take two shareholders agreed to the tender which isnt nearly enough to acquire the company take two has already said the original tender is not sufficient if ea wants to close the deal theyll have to raise the bid
5378362 i think the odds have gone up now theyre in a situation where some of the hostility has gone down
5378363 both management teams have agreed to come together and make their respective pitches i think ea is backing down from being hostile
5378364 it would be a good deal for ea because they need the content
5378365 i think the ftc will approve the deal i dont see any real monopoly concerns there
5378366 theres no question the video game sector is competitive one genre of the sector the sports category is dominated by ea and take two the two together would dominate sports i dont know if having a monopoly in one genre would constitute anticompetitive practices

5378373 we regret that formal consultations have not been successful in resolving our concerns over the duties that the eu is imposing on several high tech products
5378374 we believe that these duties are inconsistent with the eus commitments on these products and that they discourage technological innovation in the it sector

5378380 there is no nation on earth powerful enough to accomplish our overthrow our destruction should it come at all will be from another quarter from the inattention of the people to the concerns of their government from their carelessness and negligence i must confess that i do apprehend some danger i fear that they may place too implicit a confidence in their public servants and fail properly to scrutinize their conduct that in this way they may be made the dupes of designing men and become the instruments of their own undoing
5378381 unless i am convicted by scripture and plain reason and i do not accept the authority of popes and councils for they have contradicted each other my conscience is held captive to the word of god
5378382 its about coping with a sudden increase in those needing hospitalisation and keeping services going
5378383 so it is important we prioritise our services and lay down criteria for those who need to be treated first at the hospital and that we are open about what those criteria are
5378384 we regret that formal consultations have not been successful in resolving our concerns over the duties that the eu is imposing on several high tech products

5378386 even those widows who enjoy social insurance cant get it directly because all insurance documents must be in a mans name
5378387 a widow always is considered a burden and subjected to more criticism and interference from others
5378388 for instance a young widow may not remarry because she must preserve the dignity of her dead husbands family moreover those with children should never consider remarriage or theyll lose custody of their children
5378389 many widows have disclosed that they feel embarrassed about constantly asking their relatives for help preferring instead to make their own income

5378394 after i finished university i started thinking about a project to help the neediest people so i took a project management training course during that time i already was working with my friend to help poor families providing them food and collecting donations through this volunteer work i discovered that widows comprise the majority of poor families so i decided to form this organization to help them
5378395 the overwhelming majority of widows are in despair we cant do anything for them unless we instill hope in their minds and make them feel their importance as effective members of society
5378396 were planning to make deals with restaurants and cosmetics stores to buy and market the widows products
5378397 acquiring skills and obtaining work even if its hard is better than asking others for money

5378474 a great deal of the contentions surrounding the miller case arise from hearsay much of which has been passed along by persons not even in the same prison camp as he
5378475 you placed your personal comfort and welfare above that of your fellow prisoners of war but of greater seriousness your conduct at times and for extended periods was severely detrimental to both the welfare and the morale of your fellow prisoners many of whom had been in captivity with you for a number of years

5378565 we know that more than 80 of total drag comes from the rider not the bike thats why we spend a lot of time in the wind tunnel perfecting our bikes and working with sponsored athletes to optimize their riding position
5378566 when a cyclist buys a bike of this caliber they are clearly serious about speed and efficiency we want our triad customers to get the most from the bike so were giving them the opportunity to do the same type of wind tunnel optimization as the pros
5378567 anywhere from 70 90 of a riders power output is used to overcome wind resistance positioning is extremely important for cyclist to be able to minimize drag while still producing maximum power
5378568 for example we recently compared a traditional road bike riding position with the same rider on a time trial bike
5378569 at 40 kilometers per hour the rider used 24 less power measured in wattage on the time trial machine clearly finding the best riding position is critical to maximizing results for both professional and serious amateur riders

5378585 its a wonderfully eclectic objet dart speckled with an observable indifference for maureen dowd
5378586 i tried reading your blog but i couldnt fucking understand any of it
5378587 i decided to go to maryland in early august it was between maryland and west virginia as the recruiting process went on the coaching staff on both sides changed west virginia was still keeping in contact with me i was talking to coach stew because he was going to be my position coach
5378588 my recruiting coach at maryland got fired and i was still talking a little bit to west virginia too i decided to come on an official visit and i decided that this is the place that i wanted to be
5378589 im from pittsburgh so this an hour and fifteen minutes away from me
5378590 its close to home and just the atmosphere down here is one of the best in college football
5378591 i talked to coach mullen prior to deciding to come here and he was saying that he was going to open the offense up a little bit more and get the tight end more involved
5378592 i thought that was an exciting role to be in
5378593 they were talking like i could be a defensive end if i put on weight because they play that three man front
5378594 theyve put the tight end in a lot of different sets and different formations in the backfield on the line out in the slot so its a pretty open offense
5378595 im more of the blocking traditional tight end will is obviously faster and quicker
5378596 hell line up in the backfield more often i dont usually line up in the backfield at all i guess were two different types of tight ends with two different styles
5378597 i knew that it was going to be a lot faster in college but as soon as you step out there and get a couple of reps you realize how fast all of the plays go
5378598 youve got to know your role and what youre supposed to do in a split second especially with this tempo offense youve got to be on the ball quick get lined up and the play goes
5378599 in the past couple of days ive become more comfortable with my role in certain plays and just learning the footsteps for playing tight end because i really havent played tight end there is a lot of footwork involved
5378600 well watch film for an hour and a half to two hours a day
5378601 hell critique what your footsteps are and the patterns you run everyday
5378602 i never played tight end i went on flat routes and some post routes
5378603 i didnt consistently run routes and thats the biggest thing i have to learn the footsteps for the blocking plays and getting better and running routes
5378604 i think they might try to work me into the backfield at some point
5378605 im still learning the offense but theyre putting me in the two tight end formations and the one tight end formation
5378606 its a nice compliment to be chosen first and earn the respect of our big east peers however we know there is a lot of work to do for us to end the season atop the standings it is important to stay focused and work hard in our pursuit of ending the season in first place

5378726 i know i have to step it up again football is a game that doesnt stay still i performed well last season and the fans voted me player of the year but thats all in the past now
5378727 i love it here the club wants to sign me and there wont be any problems on that front
5378728 its a very strong squad on paper and now we need to deliver a performance which indicates that strength
5378729 it is obviously disappointing not to be selected and you want to be playing for your country but if mr capello doesnt put you in the squad then we have to go out and prove him wrong
5378730 mr capello does come to villa quite a lot and i am not going to give up
5378731 but i want to play for my country ive played for the under 21s and i want to be in the full squad i want to get on the pitch and play and hopefully i can do that
5378732 but as soon as the squad is picked and if youre in the under 21 side you should be ready to roll your sleeves up and think i must do well in this squad
5378733 it is important that players view international football whether it be for the under 21 side or the seniors as an education
5378734 i am very excited to assume this position with the los angeles galaxy

5378771 the court should recognize the privacy interests of these customers especially since echostar does not need these customer lists in order to have its day in court against freetech
5378772 once the names of freetech customers are disclosed to echostar there may be little that any court can do to protect these people from harassment settlement demands and legal expenses

5378821 yes its a website but this this this and this could be changed to make it much better
5378822 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

5378824 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5378825 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5378826 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5378827 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5378830 aw man that jook king in the castle with his solid walls and all
5378831 i want to move to israel and fight for the jewish people
5378832 ehhh no no you should travel around south america youre only 26 your parents will give you the money no
5378833 so i was right this is where you go all the time
5378834 and dont even try to deny what youve been doing because theres just no point
5378835 you love me but these girls just get you horny when they dance in that way and you like the release you get from wanking after they dance for you
5378836 well yes i love you completely and i love the sex we have together
5378837 i dont mind if you wank as you watch me
5378838 is this how you like girls to dance for you
5378839 i hit my finger with the hammer and it hurts
5378840 then chip off a little piece of ice and hold it to your finger
5378841 paul always remember that there are other worlds to sing in
5378842 i guess that your finger must have healed by now
5378843 i wonder if you have any idea how much you meant to me during that time
5378844 i wonder she said if you know how much your calls meant to me i never had any children and i used to look forward to your calls
5378845 then im sorry to have to tell you sally has been working part time the last few years because she was sick she died five weeks ago

5378847 at the all star game they had authorized security personnel who could watch the person catch the ball and then come up to them and with their handheld device they would register the person who caught the ball scan that particular hologram then that persons information goes into a database to record that they are the person who owns this ball
5378848 volunteers needed to help brave 10 year old battle against the odds
5378849 if a person is entering text that has some reference to locations an address or something more informal we want to find out where it is on a map and not get confused if there are extraneous terms or conflicting or wrong information
5378850 and we make minimal assumptions about the structure of that text
5378851 is how do you find the subset efficiently there could easily be over a billion different ways you could put these combinations together our key insight is to use spatial overlap operations to prune candidates in a depth first search for viable combinations
5378852 because we do some pre computing of approximate representations in space of these entities
5378853 spatial intersection overhead is very low the key innovation is that we are able to rapidly converge on promising solutions by leveraging information from the spatial domain
5378854 and describing some of the work done by the dmx group and that included being able to match comparable addresses we were able to use their approximate text searching technology along with our algorithm to build a complete solution
5378855 was that you cant do geocoding of addresses in india because of the complexity and messiness of addresses we decided to tackle this in an unusual way
5378856 we have as far as we know the best technology available for a place like india
5378857 we are much better able to tackle complex addresses we are also distinctly better when it comes to handling errors
5378858 weve taken a problem which is fairly old a problem that people have built industries around and weve found a completely different way of solving it
5378859 one great benefit of this is that it doesnt take us any time to customize it to any particular area because we dont rely on any training or handcrafted rules
5378860 our core algorithms are not even specific to two dimensional map area domains we are on the lookout for other completely different applications
5378861 i am seeing igp at 11 a m today matter will be solved be cool
5378862 find a scientist whos drowning in data and is desperate
5378863 maybe using these technologies or a database or some of our data mining tools might help
5378864 ehhhh of course i spent one year in america with shoshana and the kids of course i am speaking the english goodly

5378879 actions across a huge geographic area from lebanon to afghanistan but is also far more sweeping in the type of actions permitted including the assassination of targeted officials
5378880 cockburn seems to want us to get excited that this lebanon to afghanistan offensive may involve assassination
5378881 were already assassinating people in somalia with freaking cruise missiles were doing the same thing in pakistan with hellfire missiles fired from pilotless spy planes the folks who pickle off the missiles are dweebs sitting at consoles in an air force base in nevada
5378882 the door to this barn has been open for a long long time that the horses are gone shouldnt be news to anybody
5378883 there is considerable speculation and buzz in washington today suggesting that the national security council has agreed in principle to proceed with plans to attack an iranian al qods run camp near tehran that is believed to be training iraqi militants
5378884 was the only senior official urging delay the decision is the direct result of concerns over the deteriorating situation in lebanon where iranian ally hezbollah appears to have gained the upper hand against government forces
5378885 some sort of unambiguous signal has to be sent to the iranian leadership presumably in the form of cruise missiles
5378886 will still have to give the order to launch after all preparations are made

5378969 being one of the largest companies in the world we believe it is our responsibility to use technology in emerging markets to improve development agriculture is a huge and crucial sector in india and we are working to see how we can use our expertise to improve farming conditions practices and lives of farmers
5378970 we differentiate farming techniques with good results and those without and communicate the difference to farmers an example is seeding technique random versus systematic seeding shows that the latter consumes less water increases yield and occupies less space the same is communicated to farmers
5378971 theyve been a great help they act as the local management team they give us the content and we put together quality information on farming and take it from village to village we believe there is lot of clarity when farmers see on video what they themselves are doing we get farmers to make these videos and be a part of them
5378972 weve done our own evaluation that suggests a seven fold increase in adoption of best farming techniques by farmers and a 10 fold increase in cost benefit ratios people are using less water incurring lower input costs and getting more
5378973 to prove useful our intervention has to increase yield reduce costs and enable farmers to have more to sell in the market ultimately the farmers income must go up thats when it all matters

5379006 super star shirt that was two sizes too small with flip flops and my hair in a bun it was pretty let me tell you tuesday i can not remember what happened this day i am sure it was so traumatic i have amnesia about it oh yes now i remember my bathtub drain clogged up and it now takes 8 hours for it to drain out i have tried everything i know but the stupid thing just wont budge i have been through this before if you read the blog then you know about the fight i got into with this old tub we are no longer friends here is the post if you want to read about it http keirawelterphotography typepad com blog 2008 02 i got into a fi html wednesday attended the funeral of our wonderful next door neighbor who we will greatly miss and i hit a cat someones pet it was in the middle of my lane on the highway with a potato chip bag stuck on its head i heard it thump under the car i stopped devastated and upset and so did a gentleman who saw what i did we talked for a moment about the incident and then i leaned down and pulled the bag off the cats head i was a bit afraid the head was going to come off with it but the cat just laid there then all of a sudden the cat started to breath shook its head and ran off damn they do have 9 lives he might be slower but at least hes alive thursday hubby was supposed to be walking in the house from iraq but had not even left the country yet kgs shut off my gas because of non payment however i had used their automated system and paid the total amount due 323 26 evidently the automated system was wrong so instead of coming by or calling they shut off my gas no hot water no shower to attend funeral as stated above no doing laundry you get the idea the worst part about the kgs is how they treated me like i was a dead beat and did not pay my bills the guy who shut it off was nice to me but the woman on the phone was just plain rude to me and told me they could do whatever they wanted to because the cold weather rule was over if i was not going to pay my bill and know that my gas would be shut off i would have kept my 323 26 i called the kcc and finally heard from kgs who told me that i could go ahead and pay between 200 300 and they would turn it back on i told him no that i would pay whatever i had really owed and i was not paying them anymore one until 1 5 weeks when my bill was due and it was only 186 00 but no way in hell which i live in right now and yes on monday it did freeze over was i paying his company eerily he was a tad bit rude and i told him that i did have the money to pay him but was not because it was the principal of the situation if this was being done to me their automated service telling customers the wrong amount and then shutting off the gas then getting three different statements calling kgs and no one calling them back and then charging them an outrageous amount to come turn it back on later then i am more than happy to go to the press he told me he would call me back the next morning because it was too late to turn the gas back on at night anyways 6 45pm how is it that they can shut off your gas 24 hours a day but cant turn it back on the worst part of this entire phone call was it took place during my daughters dance rehearsal so i missed watching her dance friday served a warrant for my arrest from the irs for withholding taxes for 2006 the problem i did not have any employees during the year of 2006 i also received a phone call from kgs saying they would be happy to take my payment of what was left due turn my gas on asap and they would waive the restoration fee and not require me to have a deposit and my next bill would be due in a week i gave him my piece of mind about the restoration fee and deposit

5379094 come on please dont destroy the beautiful bilingual nature of canada this way what would happen to francophones outside quebec in this scenario what would happen to new brunswick
5379095 quebec would lose control over education that is also federal in the us system
5379096 quebec would not be able to offer medicare since the us finds socialized medicine intolerable for some reason
5379097 subsidies that are normal for us eg film culture publishing etc would all contravene the market forces obsession that americans have
5379098 canada for one is not a bilingual country you have predominately french in quebec with a minority anglo element roc predominately ango with a minority franco element new brunswick is a bit of an anomaly and i am not sure of the split anglo franco figures
5379099 joining the us would not be a huge deal for most qu b cois in terms of their culture
5379100 the usa would be better off if they could give detroit cleveland and buffalo to canada rather than adding montreal to their collection of rust belt cities
5379101 new brunswick is roughly two thirds anglo and one third franco the northeast and northwest are almost 100 french speaking north central nb is more mixed as is the southeast around moncton central nb extreme south and southwest are almost 100 anglo
5379102 thanks for the clarification i really wasnt sure about this so nb is majority to a lesser degree the the roc anglo with two thirds anglo one third french likely explains their official bilingual status
5379103 its odd how many of the posts here are ad hominem attacks on afg if you have arguments to make against independence for quebec and there are some then well make them
5379104 here it is in black and white quebec economy in canada stinks even with all the billions of dollars of handouts the rest of canada is booming and quebec is lagging behind not becuse les autres are taking advantge of them becuase quebec is like east berlin
5379105 but here every molehill with respect to quebec automatically becomes a mountain just because it wont lie down under the single canadian identity steamroller that suggests that theres only one way to be a citizen of this country
5379106 while everyone in the roc seems preoccupied at shaking their heads at critical stuff like the differences in margarine colours between quebec and the other provinces la belle province has been in spite of its internal wrangling over independence or federalism busy catching up to you guys the statistical aberration that is petro lottery grand prize winner alberta notwithstanding there is still a lot of work to do in quebec but one should not forget that while the uk spent decades looking down its nose at the emerald isle the irish were slowly getting their act together and eventually overtook the british in per capita income and standard of living eat my dust john bull
5379107 ive lived in quite a few places and visited a heck of a bunch more and quebec is pretty well average for the western world
5379108 why is it that its so provocative to say anything positive about quebec
5379109 and as the fossil based highly polluting power generation systems that predominate in northeastern north america become less and less viable financially and ecologically over the next while all of those massive hydroelectric facilities in quebec will become even more profitable than they already are
5379110 quietly but surely quebec has become the destination of choice for immigration
5379111 as well perhaps its a fundamental difference in philosophy but i dont see whats so outrageous about having access to universal daycare and also greater access to university so that its not only rich kids who get to go
5379112 saskatchewan is getting short shrift you should complain to your saskatchewan elected officials rather than point the finger at other provinces whose power brokers are perhaps more astute than yours
5379113 finally per capita gdp means very little until you compare it against cost of living
5379114 do you understand abp that gilles duceppe is on your side
5379115 its quite a neat trick actually the federal governement throws money at qu bec to get elected but because its unpopular in the rest of canada they deflect the blame on qu bec itself and the ind pendentists
5379116 you cant blame qu bec qu bec has massivelly rejected both the liberal and conservatives since 1993
5379117 you know abp if all westerners think like you no wonder the keep getting the shaft
5379118 every time the west is any position to acheive any real reform of the canadian federation with their only allies qu bec sovereignists and nationalists someone just yells
5379119 gdp 54th worst out of 60 states and provinces in north america somewhere about that of missisippi in the us so joining the us i suppose this is how quebec would rate
5379120 now class repeat after me quebec sucks money from ottawa and from honest hard working canadians by threatening to separate
5379121 could you cite a source for that statistic please everything i can find tells me that quebec would fall about in the middle of the states in terms of gdp per capita around oregon or new hampshire my sources are the us census bureau and statistics canada
5379122 ill let abp defend his own figures but 60 sounds about in line with what ive always read i took a look at the source you cited and the figures dont match up with what ive seen do they represent transfer payments while excluding paymenst made to offset programs that quebec administers itself that would make sense
5379123 sometimes i get the impression that they teach you to repeat that stuff in little school really it sounds like a mantra all of you simply echo and then vainly try to substantiate
5379124 now class repeat after me quebec sucks money from ottawa and from honest hard working canadians by threatening to separate
5379125 never mind also that quebec has one of the lowest rates of inequality between rich and poor gdp may mean the world to you but it means fuck all if money is concentrated in the hands of a tiny percentage of the population this being said as acajack mentions quebec has been catching up big time and has been performing extremely well for quite a few years now
5379126 but by all means dont let your opinions be troubled with facts abp
5379127 i guess i have a bit of reading to do on this topic especially considering that economy is not my strongest suit so i guess ill just shut up on this issue until someone decides to jump in and set the facts straight
5379128 french quebecers have made it very clear that they wanted out of canada
5379129 this being said i was caught making one mistake and you seem to think its enough to label me a retard
5379130 but as opposed to you on top of landscapes i also quite appreciated the people whe i was over there and i dont spend most of my time being judgmental in condemning their society even though most of their values seem quite different from mine more economically liberal and more socially conservative
5379131 anyway after a few false starts he did find the way to communicate with his audience his message i paraphrase i dont have the book with me stop worrying about qu bec let it go worry about canada western canada is just as much if not more colonized than qu bec in victoria he concluded his speech western canada needs a revolution more badly than qu bec you just dont have the guts
5379132 abp the simple fact that you confuse trudeau with qu bec nationalists and the independence movement explains why qu bec politics mystify you
5379133 anytime the west realises it can build an alliance with qu bec for a decentralized country or a new alliance between two countries all anyone has to say is
5379134 the west closed its eyes and let trudeau and chr tien continue the construction of a massivally centralised country with a combination of fera mongering and maple leaf flag waving
5379135 your are referring of course to the highly profitable hydro systems which are excluded from the federal formulae for equalization unlike non renewable resources very convenient for quebec isnt it
5379136 saskatchewan has less than 4 of the electorate alberta about 10 do you really think the feds give a damn about anything we have to say proven by the broken conservative promise made during the last federal election which cost alberta and sk huges money i guess we have to start raising the separation flag and play the same game as quebec to get noticed seems to have worked for quebec over the past few decades notice i didnt say a bad thing about quebec only that they have used politics to gain special entitlements a good plan and very astute also very polarizing but then again is this not what quebec wants
5379137 take alberta for instance one of the richest provinces per capita in the nation and a huge contributor of payments going to have not provinces they cannot afford subsidized 7 00 day care per child
5379138 well given that this is a non polluting renewable source of energy that was paid for without a penny from ottawa there is some rationale to this
5379139 prince edward island 120 000 strong and with no separation threat has wrested away the billion dollar confederation bridge dont let anyone make you believe the tolls are ever in a million years going to come close to paying for it and the department of veterans affairs headquartered in charlottetown and the only full blown federal department based outside of ottawa gatineau
5379140 the recent exchanges between the two as agf and abp only confirm my personal long held view that for the past 40 years canadian politics has all been about the french canadian family fight over whats best for quebecs future inside or outside the canadian federal framework
5379141 its ideology rather than financial means that prevents alberta from doing so if it were a country alberta would be virtually tied with luxembourg and norway as the worlds richest nation
5379142 acajack you promised you gonna leave this blog and create your own what happened
5379143 what you want to pick on poor little pei now bridge is nice they have lots of nice golf courses which are now easier to access
5379144 regarding the 60 of equalization and to follow up on what rorybellows said about quebec being the only big province receiving it consider that quebec alone has way more population than all of the other receiving provinces combined so quebec receiving 60 or whatever figure lets say the lions share anyway is not that outrageous if you take this into account
5379145 also dont forget that saskatchewan was on equalization for many years decades and only became ineligible in recent years
5379146 now on the allusion that quebec is treating itself to very generous social programs on everyone elses dime consider that 8 billion of equalization on a budget of 61 billion dollars is about 1 3 the 700 million dollars to supposedly address the fiscal imbalance is about one tenth of one percent
5379147 quebec is one of the most if not the most taxed jurisdictions in north america
5379148 hmmmm 8 61 x 100 13 not 1 3 you only missed by one order of magnitude so then a full 13 of quebecs budget is provided by money from other provinces
5379149 this begs a broader question why is it that so many provinces in as rich a country as canada cannot survive on their own financially would it be because so many of them are so used to the equalization motherlode that theyve come to depend on it
5379150 so now this has turned into a debate about equalization
5379151 some day really soon were going to have to sit down and seriously discuss the way we redistribute money around this country
5379152 sorry but i cant resist asking two more questions regarding equalization
5379153 first if the canadian federation is such a windfall for quebec why is it that so many highly intelligent people in quebec not all of them mind you but still lots have devoted their entire careers to cutting the province off from the so called financial goldmine through independence
5379154 second if quebec is such a financial drain on the rest of the country why is it that the vast majority of people polls generally show upwards of 90 including virtually 100 of the rocs political economic and intellectual leadership are so vehemently opposed to quebecs independence
5379155 i have realised that quebec should separate from the roc forever
5379156 i need now giyur and conversion to the quebec culture i put duseppe picture in the bedroom
5379157 things are so bad that quebecs gdp ranks 54th out of 60 provinces and states in north america behind many with a fraction of its population and resources it trails montana and arkansas for example and is only slightly ahead of mississipi
5379158 abp a belated thanks for posting your source on that gdp figure unfortunately i think that in this case macleans is not entirely in the right
5379159 on a personal note i lived in new orleans for a period of years it was the ghostly traces of new frances history there that really sparked my interest in quebec not to digress i had the opportunity to see a lot of mississippi during that time the ubiquitous and abject poverty that i saw in mississippi the sheer grinding hopelessness of it makes a comparison to quebec seem rather callous they are worlds apart
5379160 first if the canadian federation is such a windfall for quebec why is it that so many highly intelligent people in quebec not all of them mind you but still lots have devoted their entire careers to cutting the province off from the so called financial goldmine through independence
5379161 this has been always one of my questions and i have yet to find a satisfactory answer to this how is sovereignty going to improve my life in practical and financial terms or will it not i would love it if somebody here could provide an answer to this
5379162 no publication is objective of course mcleans is more insidious as it poses as a more or less neutral magazine with an inoffensive whitebread time magazine prose unlike say the national post that doesnt hide its conservative ideology and because as a newsmagazine mcleans doesnt have any real competitors
5379163 i doubt anyone can foretell this as the dynamics involved are too complex it is likely you would never have an idea of the financial aspect of separation until after it actually happened for either quebec of the roc
5379164 anyone who lost citizenship because of a treaty or the cessation of territory is not eligible to reclaim their citizenship
5379165 not knowing whether we face a financial nirvana or an abyss in an independent quebec is not particularly confidence inspriring
5379166 there have to more advantages to an independent quebec though please to all the sovereignists here tell me how an independent quebec will make my every day life better
5379167 no one has a crystal ball at least not me but without an attempt one will never know if things could be the nirvana or the absyss myself i dont think nirvana but rather a happy medium between the two extremes for quebec
5379168 economics if only one thing i am sure there are advantages for a sovereign quebec no more meddling from a centralist government plus the satsifaction in knowing that you are charting and responsible for your own destiny quebec can only be as quebec wants with freedom from the influence of the roc and the quebec policitians of convenience in ottawa
5379169 i personally believe that not much will change but that at the margin the province would be somewhat worse off financially without the equalization payments unfortunately instead of cuts in services that gap would probably be filled with higher taxes
5379170 i agree economics is only one thing but for me personally its a big thing
5379171 and i suspect that an independent quebec will have even more centralist governments than the federal government is today as it always had more state involvment than the other provinces
5379172 will these guys and girls still not be quebecers after independence and will they not continue to practice politics
5379173 seriously i have an open mind about this and am ready to be convinced that an independent quebec is a good thing for the province maybe ill repost this question in the next thread but tell me how is an independent quebce going to improve our lives
5379174 i only am advocating the separation because i believe in the long term the conditions as existing now can no longer continue the country is becoming increasingly polarized and unless this is arrested somehow the differences will worsen the only way it can realistically be stopped is for all provinces to be treated fairly without any special priviledges being awared to a particular jurisdicition at this particular time quebec is receiving preferential treatment which is alienating it from the other provinces eg nation state within canada lions share of equalization and other benefits
5379175 he is outsider and in reality doesnt like our quebecois culture and studies his daughter in the mcgill because it is cheaper then in the roc
5379176 thats still a hit but a lot less than a 13 hit
5379177 in such a case though i do not see much reason for cn and air canada to move to the roc nor for toronto based headquarters to move infrastructure to toronto
5379178 with respect to the gatineau region that is an interesting point i had not thought of what might happen is somewhat of a bi polar government administration between quebec city and gatineau the pq has said that quebec based federal employees would not lose their jobs so i guess that would mean having a large number of government employees in both cities it might be interesting scenario
5379179 we will be able to negotiate our own treaties with other nations
5379180 as if canada would let an independent quebec use its currency over our their dead bodies
5379181 i agree that gatineau has an interest in voting liberal now but all bets are off in an independent quebec once all those government jobs are either lost or still there add me to the camp of people sceptical about not laying of federal government workers in an independent quebec
5379182 maybe thats why canadas elites are so unanimous in wishing for quebec stay in canada and also in wanting canada as a whole to stay together
5379183 i dont get your point here although this may be due to a typo are you saying that you think public servants in gatineau are likely to be hired by an independent quebec or not
5379184 the downside for quebec would be that an independent quebec using the c would have to either negotiate a role within the central bank bank of canada or be forced to stay outside the process and take the risk that the rocs monetary policy priorities will pretty much always coincide with quebecs
5379185 you dont seem to recall very much the yes side boasted that all quebeckers were entitled to canadian passports having been canadian citizens and that no law currently on the books could take away that right the association part of sovereignty association included joint military common currency and free movement of goods and services
5379186 if they want french they should just go back to france
5379187 i am still looking for the sovereignists to tell me how an independent quebec will be a better place than it is now
5379188 its fundamental that quebec have its own armed forces an army whose loyalty is to the nation becomes a support for democratic life
5379189 see abp very clear headed understanding of the political situation and his visceral aggressivity when he talks about the separatists
5379190 and if we are forming all these partnerships with canada and thereby giving up a certain amount control freedom over our affairs with each partnership how are things going to be different than they are now
5379191 now before you make a link between afgs week off and equalization i just wanted to say that im in quebec and i dont have the week off
5379192 one thing that jumps out at me is that you would be in a community of seven million citizens rather than one of thirty some your government the ultimate level of government would be that much closer to you no longer would quebecs votes merely be holding the balance between western small or large c conservatives and eastern small or large l liberals federal politics as such simply disappears
5379193 afg put it bluntly but rightly when he asked our anonymous poster to list why canada should be an independent country from the united states
5379194 as ive mentioned previously i dont personally think independence is necessary to achieve most of this although it would make them more likely to happen if not inevitable in some cases and although i do realize that my ideas on this havent received much take up i think that quebec and the roc can have their cake and eat it too if they really want to settle matters once and for all
5379195 language tests for university graduates are also very possible but how would you be able to attract top professors researchers who do not speak franch and would these tests apply to foreign students who come here strictly to study and pay a lot more in tuition than locals most local anglos and allophones know enough french to past simple french exams and if these are more advanced exams they would not be the only ones failing them
5379196 its a wonder that places like switzerland sweden belgium finland france germany italy spain and dozens of other countries can survive intellectually without any english language universities within their borders
5379197 hmmm do you have a problem with anglos acajack it would seem as the dialogue moves on that i detect some bias in your postings look at the countries you name many english speakers so they must learn it from somewhere i suspect they have a lot of english programs in their curriculums
5379198 even if you assume a unified school system these would affect only a relatively minor portion of the population
5379199 so the unified system could be beneficial to both groups in that it would have the anglo kids less marginalized since they would be very much up to speed in french and maybe keep more of them in quebec as adults and give the franco kids better english skills than what they are acquiring at the moment
5379200 yeah the situation in ontario similar to saskatchewans i guess just boggles my mind
5379201 believe me separatism is bad and lousy thing all separatists are bad
5379202 this non confrontational and even embracing attitude may very well be leading them down the assimilation path as the depressing language transfer statistics usually show every census but it sure makes for a happier existence than that of some of our quebec angryphones constantly beating their heads against the wall
5379203 by and large having been part of the community for many years i can tell you the vast majority of franco ontarians are very relaxed about language matters and dont even bat an eye at having to speak english on occasion to get served even at their local st hubert or jean coutu or even at the beer tent of a st jean baptiste day concert
5379204 i actually attended one of the schools on your list so i can say that a fair number of the students had at least one anglo parent
5379205 table 16 is particularly evocative and shows how francophone kids outnumber anglo kids in english schools in many regions of quebec
5379206 although i sense theyre poised to make a big comeback in a few areas
5379207 all that seems necessary is to distribute them more equally mix them with the english establish english schools where they are now to thick settled
5379208 im just saying that these quebec nationalists who are soooo generous in what theyve
5379209 sure youve been insert language and culture forever but from now on this how its gonna be sorry no choice
5379210 i am seeing igp at 11 00 a m today matter will be solved be cool

5379212 theres only so much a national organization like the aclu can do on the local level to make schools safer more welcoming places for lesbian gay bisexual and transgender students but much of what can be done to improve your school are things that students parents or community members can do themselves given the right tools

5379317 the lollipops all finished now so swallow whats left in your mouth carol
5379318 now carol lets go back to when you were a teenager
5379319 well i was just sixteen and my best friend julie came to sleep over at my house
5379320 i remember i was already in bed and she was taking her clothes off standing next to the bed i was surprised at the effect her naked body had on me she had a beautiful taut athletic body and i suddenly felt all hot looking at her especially between my legs
5379321 we were to sleep in the same bed so she pulled on a flimsy nightie and got under the covers next to me the warmth of her firm flesh close to me made me giddy with lust and i could feel a warm wetness between my thighs
5379322 carol i want you to slip your hand down your panties and play with your pussy while you tell me the rest of this story
5379323 well i turned the light out and rolled over slowly so that my breasts were just touching hers i did it as if it were an accident and she didnt move away so i pressed my body up against hers some more and she pushed back her tits were really hot against mine and i feel her nipples pressing into me
5379324 then our lips touched and she started kissing me full on the mouth we wrapped our arms around each other and snogged and snogged feeling our bodies entwining it was just so horny
5379325 and then she got on top of me and we licked each others pussies in a sixty nine position i orgasmed as soon as her tongue touched my clitoris
5379326 okay carol now were going to bring you slowly back
5379327 i suggest one or two more sessions just to reinforce what weve worked on today
5379328 theres just one thing i wanted to ask after a session is it usual to have a strawberry aftertaste in my mouth

5379334 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then

5379340 practically speaking the march 20 decision would open up a number of tributaries and streams to the argument that the clean water act doesnt apply

5379342 i would not begin to throw in the towel and submit to that conclusion
5379343 if the corps of engineers applies a similar approach to other rivers protections against water pollution that are now taken for granted could be seriously eroded throughout the nation
5379344 presently the occasional use of kayaks and or canoes on other reaches of the river are sporadic and do not support any associated commerce
5379345 finally the capacity to provide navigation at some point in the future is highly doubtful given the rivers configuration hydrology and fundamental use as a flood control channel
5379346 as a boater with some 30 plus years of boating i can honestly say that its a perfectly navigable river

5379384 physical barriers to be introduced so nobody can launch within a week
5379385 the discussion about how many nuclear weapons you need takes on a different flavor
5379386 we simply are not going to get the cooperation we need around the globe without a restoration of the vision that was laid down in the nuclear nonproliferation treaty the world perceives that the countries with nuclear weapons made a pledge to step by step reduce them and eventually get rid of them
5379387 we can sit here and divide the world into good and bad

5379395 calatravas busy but basically obvious buildings can be comprehended at first glance whereas gehrys complex and ambiguous compositions take more time to absorb

5379423 at least four tomahawk cruise missiles fired from a navy ship or submarine off the somali coast had slammed into a small compound of single story buildings in dusa marreb
5379424 the nyts source for that information was an american military official in washington who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the operation notice how operations these days are sensitive as opposed to classified or secret one has to wonder how they arrived at a word like sensitive to describe things like cruise missile attacks that kill people then again so many of these missile strikes kill people other than the people they were intended to kill that yeah i guess american military officials in washington might get sensitive about that aspect
5379425 the source according to cohen is a retired u s career diplomat and former assistant secretary of state still active in the foreign affairs community speaking anonymously what seems to make the source so reliable in cohens estimation is that he or she is echoing other reports that have surfaced in the media in the united states recently thats the new journalistic litmus test for veracity all right but cohens the first writer ive heard come right out and admit it

5379440 the notion of a bilingual quebec like many quebec anglos still dream of is totally absent and even abhorred by these people
5379441 no they certainly have not pulled any punches but then they are on the demise in quebec recent polls indicate 30 or less
5379442 though it may appear contradictory to many flag waving patriotic canadians in the roc for lots of people in quebec being a qu b cois nationalist attending a st jean baptiste show with a quebec flag in your hand yet wanting to remain canadian is not mutually exclusive

5379561 going forward we are challenged to validate that 25 74 price
5379562 a mutual deal is going to have to be higher than 25 74 in order for the board of take two to save face call it a dollar or two dollars more
5379563 the integration risk is that you lose the talent and ea cant afford to lose the talent
5379564 trinidad and tobago would seek economic integration by 2011 and political integration by 2013 with any or all of the nine members of the organisation of east caribbean states
5379565 nobody even knew this was under discussion its exactly the sort of process which will ensure that the scheme doesnt work policy announced from the top to a cynical population without even being properly thought out
5379566 looking for all intents and purposes like hes giving the people of trinidad and tobago a great big meggie
5379567 if the meg means that he was only kicksing about there not being a dengue outbreak or that trinbagonians deserve a big meggie for thinking they deserve a minister of health who actually has a clue
5379568 in the absence of tourist offices where a cuban citizen can arrange in cuban pesos an excursion in his own country private resourcefulness has addressed this market niche

5379572 heydar an ex kgb chief was strong enough to ignore the opposition mostly
5379573 people remembered his soviet era corruption and expected nothing less but the son is insecure and more sensitive to criticism he comes down harder
5379574 it deals with oil companies and bp has the biggest embassy
5379575 i cannot think of a time when we have had a region emerge as suddenly to become as strategically significant as the caspian
5379576 there was utility in making the world think there was more oil than there was
5379577 azerbaijan and the rest of them are incremental suppliers thats all
5379578 they arent going to swing things or significantly relax growing tightness in supply
5379579 the leading jailer of journalists in europe and central asia
5379580 the stabbing of agil khalil is part of campaign of repression about the azerbaijani press
5379581 every march before an election there is an attack on the press before the 2005 parliamentary elections the editor of the monitor journal was murdered the government wants to instill fear and prevent dissident thinking
5379582 it is interesting that just two days before the stabbing the u s released is annual report on human rights practices
5379583 there is something to the theory that after such reports are released attacks like this take place as retribution to make the point that such reports accomplish nothing and that our government has no obligation to listen to other countries
5379584 hooliganism and causing damage to the health of a person
5379585 the western embassies here have been increasingly vocal about problems in the areas of press freedom and freedom of expression but it would be more effective if they took more concrete steps like sanctions
5379586 the oil has an impact on the political situation western countries have been very vocal in their criticism of belarus and russia but very careful about azerbaijan
5379587 the government is also adept at playing the west and russia off each other
5379588 the price suited us and more importantly we thought it would be a better place for family holidays
5379589 in the last two years my property values have appreciated by about 40 per cent and i would imagine over the next three years it will probably be about the same
5379590 the government can t do much more than they already are
5379591 they are offering fantastic interest rates to people buying property there
5379592 they are building roads motorways and everything else to help the economy move forward they re doing very very well
5379593 in quebec a corner has been turned separatism its old its boring the debates as shallow as a birdbath decades of referendums constitutional battles separatist threats drained the national spirit they curbed foreign investment preoccupied the federal government sidelined other national priorities not so now
5379594 between one third and one half of the qu b cois still want independence from canada
5379595 if half of all flemings want an independent flanders that is 30 percent of the population of belgium if half of all qu b cois want an independent qu bec that is 15 percent of the population of canada i suggest that it is this difference that causes the belgian government to get its shorts in a twist more easily than the canadian government when it comes to local independence movements
5379596 do you suppport quebec western canada making a unilateral declaration of independance as soon as possible
5379597 for the most part its probably just wishful thinking on the part of canadians theyve seen 13 years go by since the last referendum and separation hasnt even been attempted again
5379598 abp in every thread you bring the issue back to money so i wanted to make one point about the money transferred to quebec im not sure if you know these facts or perhaps you are just overlooking them
5379599 youll get an eyeful of what even the federalists in quebec have in mind as an ideal canadian set up for quebec
5379600 you know we dont like to deal with dem guys from de west i am just joking no i really mean it
5379601 so they sign cheques to keep the peace for now
5379602 quebec will never separate because the welfare check is too good and where would good quebekers be without their checks in hand
5379603 for there must be a record of these evil plottings
5379604 well the bq for one arent they a separatist group they have a significant vote in parliament which gilles has used to quebecs advantage the other issues buying votes by harper and co of course if quebec had more of a conscience they wouldnt allow themselves to be bought as acajack has suggested
5379605 i see abps understanding of parliamentary democracy is as refined as his comprehension of the official languages act
5379606 hundreds of billions in costs because of the official languages act wow lets see some stats on that one please
5379607 as a religion bilingualism is the god that failed it has led to no fairness produced no unity and cost canadian taxpayers untold millions
5379608 make no mistake canada is not a bilingual country in fact it is less bilingual today than it has ever been
5379609 unilingual anglophones will be sentenced to a lifetime of job immobility
5379610 could it not be that montreals decline and the flight of capital had to do principally with the end of its importance as a seaport
5379611 personally i dont see that the distinction between quebecs redistributive programs
5379612 subsidized tuition at uq and cheap quebec daycare are pretty poor examples of wasteful government largesse
5379613 you might argue that montreal and thus quebec could have managed the decline of its principal industry better on the other hand i could argue that montreal has done a hell of a lot better than other cities areas in the region anywhere in upstate new york
5379614 one last question this time to the independentistes why are you so married to the canadian currency
5379615 ouch an american telling canadians that the only thing that makes them not american is the presence of the qu b cois amongst them if i know anything about english canadians that made a lot of people upset
5379616 perhaps qu bec should unilateraly adopt the euro or the pound
5379617 currently the federal government is inhibiting their growth in many ways
5379618 qu becs gdp might be lower than albertas but can you tell me why i should care when qu becs dropout rate is about the same its infant mortality 50 lower and the crime rate half the one in alberta so you have more money you spent it all on pickups bravo

5379650 as i was driving home tonight i started thinking about whom i would honor with this ribbon and i thought about you i want to honor you my days are really hectic and when i come home i dont pay a lot of attention to you sometimes i scream at you for not getting good enough grades in school and for your bedroom being a mess but somehow tonight i just wanted to sit here and well just let you know that you do make a difference to me besides your mother you are the most important person in my life youre a great kid and i love you

5379656 once humanity and its needs have been elevated to sovereign determination of public an private action anything that can be represented as an affront or an impediment to this painless existence of men and women is made to seem morally unacceptable an outrage morality then appears self evident it is the palliation of whatever humans themselves regard as the cause of their suffering and deprivation a set of material assumptions about human nature is plainly persuasive among those persuaded as it seems are many leaders of christian opinion this is additionally puzzling since for centuries the christian church which was founded in an act of expiatory pain has regarded human suffering as not only inseparable from the nature of life on earth but also as a necessary condition in spiritual formation the reality is human pursuit of security and an escalating set of entitlements quite at variance with the christian insistence that life was not ordained for pleasure or repose

5379678 market prices for ingredients such as cocoa corn sweeteners sugar and peanuts are up 20 to 45 since the beginning of the year as such in 2009 we expect our commodity cost increase to be more than double the 2008 increase
5379679 overall their second quarter results show that maybe some restructuring and new products initiatives were gaining traction but this just seems to put the brakes on

5379781 el maestro ense ar a los santos a vivir de acuerdo con el libro de la regla de la comunidad para que puedan buscar a d s y hacer ante el lo que es bueno y justo como el orden mediante moshe y todos sus servidores los profetas
5379782 transgrede una palabra de la ley de moshe o cualquier otro punto ser expulsado
5379783 que entran en la nueva alianza en la tierra de damasco y que de nuevo la traicionan y se van
5379784 yo soy jes s responde la voz a quien t persigues
5379785 la justicia m a la que viene de la ley
5379786 si un hombre transgrede despu s de jurar que vuelve a la ley de moshe de todo coraz n y alma entonces se le aplicar el justo castigo
5379787 y si cristo no ha resucitado vana es nuestra predicaci n y vana nuestra fe
5379788 si cristo no es el mes as vana es nuestra fe

5379790 en l se revela la justicia de dios de fe en fe como dice la escritura el justo vivir por la fe
5379791 que la ley no justifica a nadie ante d s es cosa evidente pues el justo vivir por la fe
5379792 pero el justo por su fe vivir esto concierne a todos los que observan la ley en la casa de jud a quienes d s librar de la casa del juicio debido a sus sufrimientos y debido a su fe en el maestro de justicia
5379793 we thought we had to fight with eugene mccarthy and those people
5379794 those of us who have been in the streets for the past five days didnt give a flying fuck whether mccarthy would win or lose
5379795 my own support for obama is not a reflection of a radically changed attitude toward the democratic party
5379796 rather its a recognition that the obama campaign has become a rallying point for young activists and offers hope for rebuilding the civil rights and antiwar coalitions that have potential to become a real critical force in society

5379810 i have nothing to say against scoring system or gojans strategy i guess i would have done the same and protected the lead had i been in his place
5379811 boxing may be a four round game but fortunes are made in the first two rounds and once you manage to take a lead its all about protecting the lead gojan didnt do anything wrong
5379812 anyway i have no excuse to offer it was simply not my day even though i tried my best i think the scoreline could have been different in the first round and that could have been crucial for me
5379813 a great politician and at the same time a very good philosopher boswells frequent description of burke whom he never names because burke was an active politician at the time yl observed to me that locke who displayed such extraordinary powers in analyzing human understanding shewed he had very little use of it himself when he attempted to apply it practically to the subject of government
5379814 if you want to replace the name locke with edmund burkes or adam smiths and rousseaus with i dunno deweys or sorels i think you can make pretty much the same point i make in my locke v rousseau spiel

5379816 defense was a big part of what we were talking about at halftime
5379817 what she brought the loose balls the blocks the tips the way she locked up valdemoro who had given us problems in that stretch i felt she completely changed the game for us on the defensive end
5379818 she changes games without having to shoot pass or dribble
5379819 the biggest thing for me is just doing what i can to help this team
5379820 when i was chosen for this team they said they want me to come out and bring my defensive intensity and focus on that so thats pretty much what ive done defense has been the staple for me helping my team

5379871 i swear we got more thanks from the nba basketball players or the dallas cowboy cheerleaders than from one of the senators who wants to be the president of the united states i just dont understand how anyone would want him to be our commander and chief it was almost that he was scared to be around those that provide the freedom for him and our great country

5379882 the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the cold war
5379883 hes a young man that plays extremely hard and plays with a great deal of physicality
5379884 hes no holds barred in terms of his aggressiveness runs the floor well and can defend multiple positions
5379885 ive been told they want to go in that direction and add a little bit of depth in that area
5379886 offense is very important but these guys need to make a commitment on the defensive end and take a lot of pride in not allowing guys to score on us
5379887 we just felt like there was too big of a drop off over the last couple of years when steve nash went out of the game and that we couldnt always survive on just making jump shots
5379888 you have to be able mix it up get offensive rebounds and make dirt worker plays as cotton fitzsimmons used to say you have to be able to draw charges and create extra possessions
5379889 he goes along those lines of that defensive tenacity theme that were putting together this summer
5379890 hes a good shotblocker has an exceedingly high amount of energy and plays with that sort of abandon that we needed to bring to our team
5379891 hes really versatile for a big man in that he can grab the ball off the board and lead a fast break hes similar to boris in that he is a big man that can pass well
5379892 but hes different from most bigs in that he can put it on the floor and make a play hes a guy who will face up and create something for others and not worry about scoring himself
5379893 we paid close attention to him at the summer league in las vegas with the golden state warriors
5379894 hes very active the kind of guy you like to have coming off the bench to change the tempo of the game
5379895 if we can develop him then we have yet another good young asset
5379896 playing with steve nash shaq and amar stoudemire you cant ask for more than that
5379897 those guys are great players hall of famers i cant wait to get down here and get things started
5379898 owais is going to bat at number three for the simple fact that i think he was wasted at number seven
5379899 hes a high scoring quick scoring cricket player who plays cricket shots to get boundaries
5379900 theres definitely a strong case for owais getting a good opportunity to bat and play long innings for england
5379901 i want to give the guys a good run at it and concentrate on a specific role so when something happens and you need to change at least ive identified the roles the players need to play and they can just slot in and slot out
5379902 a certain quality in an individual personality by virtue of which he is set apart from ordinary men and treated as endowed with supernatural superhuman or at least specifically exceptional powers or qualities
5379903 rife with inside dealing questionable accounting practices and short term greed
5379904 high gas bills insufficient health insurance and a pension that some bankruptcy court somewhere has rendered unenforceable
5379905 narrow interests vie for advantage and ideological minorities seek to impose their own versions of absolute truth
5379906 begin the process of changing politics and our civic life
5379907 this nation is more than the sum of its parts that out of many we are truly one
5379908 our communal values our sense of mutual responsibility and social solidarity
5379909 because here each one tells his story and listens to the other ones story we hope that if the surrounding society would behave like this it would be the beginning of a change
5379910 i can stand on this stage and say all the things that i want to say but the problem is that the people dont want to hear about these things
5379911 we said to arabs and jews you have the stage and you can say whatever you like people threw out all sorts of things that were inside them everything was released and afterwards we drank coffee together we showed if you are against somebody you dont have to kill him you can talk to him
5379912 if the israeli government wants to deal with the palestinians this is the best place for it to study here we are both equal if the politicians did the same as we do we would have had peace many years ago
5379913 even if we dont do a good restoration we can make a good relationship between jews and arabs and all the people here
5379914 to do things correctly with the people to ask their opinion and work with then not against them
5379915 if you want to restore something then do it exactly like it was it doesnt matter whether it was palestinian british or turkish the city is like a book when you open the book you see its pattern thats my responsibility to do it very straight and very honestly
5379916 this is history the destiny of the city its rulers all build and destroy first the turks then the british and then the israelis we are starting not just to rebuild things but to connect them together again because jaffa has to be the place where jews muslims and christians can connect like they used to
5379917 firstly that they are women with less rights than men and secondly that they are part of a national minority as arabs in a jewish state we want to change that not from the top but from the bottom up
5379918 the arab women of jaffa need their own place to learn computer skills almost nobody among them knows how to use a computer to take courses in arabic literacy and english a place that they can feel is their own we tried to make urs al bahr like someones home so the women would come because it is a feminine space
5379919 during this period of building our country we know nothing about arab customs habits manners tribes and social trends their economic and cultural situation and more in all the zionist literature there is not even one book that would describe these peoples lives accurately or contain genuine information about their situation

5379923 ive been dilberted again the old man revised the specs for the fourth time this week
5379924 well id like to be going down there with a picnic basket with some wine or vodka drinks or beer and some cheese or fried chicken yea a nice picnic casual dinner with a really hot guy who was actually interested in me and not sex who finds me amusing and good looking and intelligent and who genuinely likes me for me and likes to be around me and
5379925 but youre not youre going down there with your gay friends arent you
5379926 i think the roll call will be a cathartic moment
5379927 there will be a lot of people who will say oh what might have been and will vote for obama but there will be a lot of tears
5379928 were not going to win by pretending problems with barack obama dont exist he has a huge problem connecting with ordinary americans who think he doesnt understand me he is not modest he is arrogant he radiates elitism
5379929 he has provided her with a pittance compared to what the clintons have given obama
5379930 her debt could have been cleared within 10 days its ungracious
5379931 were within 100 tickets of a lower bowl sellout and weve always said thats a significant objective
5379932 and the other very significant goal which is unprecedented for us in this market is surpassing 10 000 season tickets very few teams in the nba accomplish that and even the large markets have a difficult time doing it so were very proud that in this market weve been able to do what markets five or six or seven times this size have been unable to do
5379933 again just to make sure were calibrating with what were saying its full season tickets not partial plans that add up to full season
5379934 thats a significant increase over anything weve historically done in this market
5379935 but the connection the fans feel with this specific team and the character of the players on this team youll remember we had a team that was a playoff caliber team the first couple of years we were here so it takes more than just winning you have to have a commitment by your players to give back to the community the community sees that in these young men and they really want to be part of it in terms of being a season ticket holder
5379936 we know there are a lot of fans and businesses that cant invest the time or money to come to all the games and share the tickets with business partners and the like
5379937 the partial plans are very affordable our 10 game plans start at about 145 and the half season plans start at about 250 or so were trying to make sure this is very inclusive for all the community regardless of your time and budget
5379938 and in the upper bowl its a different type of fan that wants to sit in the 300 section but theyre walking away knowing the investment they made in that ticket was well worth it because they had a great 2 1 2 hours of fun last year we called it the big easy balcony which really isnt what that area is all about its really about our most fanatic fans good times and families
5379939 this will put us in a position to continue the trend we had which was making the benchmark irrelevant
5379940 the whole point of the benchmark was to create a place holder where the fans and the community could say lets define success and success was achieving this level on a sustained basis ten thousand season tickets makes those benchmarks irrelevant
5379941 those who dont use it but can see its usefulness
5379942 those who use it if the job calls for it
5379943 im very excited to get a guy like mo williams on our team hes one of the most underrated guards that we have in our league and hes gonna bring some explosion to us offensively and defensively hes very good

5379980 as a constitutionalist i am really curious to see what their arguments will be
5379981 i usually never turn down interviews french or english but your articles have been unfair dishonest and
5379982 the usa should also pass a law mandating english as americas only official language
5379983 interestingly those same people do not consider that qu becs publicly funded english school boards are a form of
5379984 but how is it social engineering for an english speaker to be able to get an education in english
5379985 i have come to the conclusion that the best way to empower the people of qu bec in the peculiar sociological and geographical situation they are in is an independent state to the extent that there is such a thing as independence in the globalized world
5379986 i dont accept the name separatist because it places the entire burden of of justifying the
5379987 you can in effect call some of these forms of
5379988 the rules was adopted try the rules were adopted plural
5379989 to follow up on afgs comments on this in general anglo saxon liberalism has not traditionally favoured separate educational and other institutions for diverse groups that make up society even historically established ones
5379990 very few places in the world have a bona fide separate publicly funded education system all the way up to university for a group that only makes up 8 of the population even a historically established one
5379991 one very fruitful line of analysis when trying to understand what oppose the french and english both here and more traditionally in europe is to consider how anglo saxon political philosophy is centered almost solely around liberalism whereas the latin catholic outlook always tries to balance individual and collective rights
