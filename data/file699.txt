6990000 she always inspired me as a kid and even in my adult life ive watched the movies many times this is a highlight for me you cant come all the way to p e i and not come here
6990001 we live maybe 15 miles about 25 kilometres from cross creek and they have their own little homestead and stuff like this
6990002 i love my baby so much i gave up going to sturgis this year with all my buddy bikers to come on this tour with her
6990003 i thought this would be like the readers digest condensed version of everything we can see a lot in a little bit of time
6990004 my dads side of the family is irish and french canadian ive been to ireland and scotland five times a couple of years ago i started reading up on nova scotia and p e i and people always said that without going across the ocean its the closest thing to ireland and scotland as you can find in north america
6990005 actually when i was a kid our family came to cavendish for summer vacations and i came back for business on the island but ive never been back to see green gables
6990006 so this time i had time and that was first on my list to come to see how the park is now its very moving to see that because you see canadian heritage a woman who wrote marvellous books we have had movies tv series its great canadian history and you see all these young people taking care of that
6990007 this has been a dream of mine for 30 years when i went over that bridge yesterday there were tears in my eyes
6990008 i think there are so many things for children to learn with anne her imagination her spirit her positive attitude she was dealt a pretty rotten little hand in life even though she was fictional and kids today sometimes they have pretty rotten little hands dealt to them
6990009 if they can learn to overcome that theres always something better if they have that spirit of anne theyre going to make it in life and we should all have a matthew in our life somebody that loves us just unconditionally
6990010 watching the sunset and sensing anne and diana right behind me i couldnt help but quote annes comment to marilla after visiting aunt josephine in charlottetown with diana

6990013 i found choosing an economy car over a hybrid was often the more economical choice
6990014 theyre having a hard time in off peak periods even giving away these things
6990015 it used to be that many customers would purposely book a smaller car knowing that they could likely get an upgrade at the counter for free when the car they reserved wasnt available
6990016 today there are a lot of objections to the larger vehicle and a lot of times the consumers perception of a car being a gas guzzler doesnt match up with reality
6990017 from an economic benefit standpoint consumers have to ask does the value proposition really hold

6990026 you never really expect it to be someone that youre close to but after a few minutes when it started to sink in i was very proud
6990027 its always difficult when a friend dies however theres a time for mourning and theres a time for standing up and carrying on
6990028 you wouldnt think you were going to get hurt but he would hurt you
6990029 he told me maccready im going to save this beer for when you get back
6990030 he was the kind of guy that i could look to for reassurance or confirmation he was proud to go and he knew what he was doing
6990031 like a child awaiting christmas he even initiated a countdown as he got closer to going overseas
6990032 he insisted many times are we not here for the kids is that not why we are here dustin was there for the kids and hoped one day his work would make a difference
6990033 its tough you talk to everybody talk to the family just make sure that everybody that needs to talk to somebody can talk to somebody

6990036 in ontario there are three confirmed deaths at this point linked to the investigation and another is still under investigation
6990037 there are some additional cases of listeria currently under investigation in quebec
6990038 we have one confirmed case of listeria thats associated with the provincial outbreak and that case is deceased
6990039 we have confirmed that the primary cause of death is listeriosis
6990040 because he was sick and because he had other conditions it absolutely played a role
6990041 he was sick he had listeria and that was a factor in his death
6990042 what well find out is whether the illness and the meat were linked if its the same strain
6990043 in ontario there are three confirmed deaths at this point linked to the investigation and another is still under investigation
6990044 there are some additional cases of listeria currently under investigation in quebec
6990045 we have one confirmed case of listeria thats associated with the provincial outbreak and that case is deceased
6990046 we have confirmed that the primary cause of death is listeriosis
6990047 what well find out is whether the illness and the meat were linked if its the same strain
6990048 weve put in place a new system that allows us to detect an outbreak and to see a pattern very early in the game
6990049 im glad we got hold of it early and now well take serious steps working with the feds to put it behind us
6990050 there had been some clues from veterinary medicine as well as an outbreak in boston that listeria could be a food borne illness
6990051 but that had never been proven in humans before probably because most outbreaks occur in small clusters and you cant get enough epidemiologic information
6990052 they were using raw manure on the fields and the guy was raising sheep as well and he also had listeria in his sheep flock
6990053 he said agreeing that there was much uncertainty and a great deal of heartbreak
6990054 and of course in the pregnancy related cases the mothers survived but they lost their child often a late term infant or sometimes an early miscarriage
6990055 unfortunately some of these outbreaks actually inform the public that there is that danger out there
6990056 we dont want to use that as a normal way of informing the public but thats the way that it sometimes happens
6990057 it basically said that instead of this being an organism of unknown etiology or unknown source that this in fact was a food borne organism like any other like campylobacter or salmonella and therefore we need to start paying attention to manufacturing issues we need to pay attention to what goes on on the abattoir floor
6990058 many fish are hard to tell apart once theyve been filleted and packaged
6990059 we hope our work lights the way to getting mislabelled and endangered fish species out of grocery store refrigerators and frying pans
6990060 i think probably the best way to avoid mislabelling is to work directly through a local fish monger or someone with a reputable business that is with dealing with whole fresh fish
6990061 so here you think youre are trying to make the right choice and be a green consumer and you are still eating a threatened species
6990062 once that happens in the u s i suspect canada will similarly adopt it

6990064 criminal networks can profit by collecting e waste in developed countries such as canada and selling it to recyclers in developing nations the cisc report reads
6990065 this practice is a violation of both canadian and international law
6990066 one of the reasons organized crime has been as successful as it is is that theyre very adaptable said rcmp commissioner william elliott who chairs cisc
6990067 if it wasnt lucrative organized crime groups wouldnt be involved in it
6990068 were realizing that in terms of sales of laptops and electronic devices to organized crime there is often damage to the environment and its a national concern said robert chartrand a montreal police investigator who heads criminal intelligence service quebec one of ciscs provincial bureaus
6990069 canadian forests are vulnerable to illegal harvesting due to their relative abundance isolation and the large number of logging access roads the report says
6990070 the illegal trade in wildlife can be as profitable as dealing in narcotics the united nations environment programme stated earlier this year
6990071 we have in canada an abundant supply on the one hand of natural resources including fisheries and forestry elliott said
6990072 but we have all seen that overexploitation of natural resources can have dramatic effects

6990076 if he pulls the plug on the parliament without even having the members of the house come back to their seats and show what they can do then hes showing contempt for the democratic institutions and for the fact that canadians did not elect him to a majority government only to a minority
6990077 he will break the law he will break his word canadians will know how much he is not trustworthy

6990080 were purposefully focused on imposing administrative liability on robert dudley alone
6990081 there has been an abuse of power by the state labour inspectorate
6990082 the inspection was not intended to serve the purpose of a full and comprehensive examination of compliance with labour legislation but rather was an attempt at all costs and as soon as possible to initiate the procedure to disqualify r w dudley
6990083 he was unable to appear due to having been invited at exactly the same time to attend the federal migration service of the russian federation for the purposes of extending his visa
6990084 the inspector knew that findings of violations would be made
6990085 the above circumstances are simply the most flagrant examples of the prejudicial attitude of the said officials to the inspection carried out in respect of ojsc
6990086 all the checks that took place at the firm were done by the law
6990087 the rain will move across the country tonight with the chance of thunder

6990089 southern and eastern parts of the uk will remain dry on monday but with quite a lot of cloud cover
6990090 the north and west will have outbreaks of rain although it will not be particularly heavy
6990091 russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6990092 it is my understanding that they russian forces have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that

6990100 in de reeksen hebben we een onmogelijk niveau gehaald en in de finale gaan we iets proberen
6990101 wij starten in baan 8 met de amerikanen net achter ons ik heb aan kevin gevraagd om zich in het zog te zetten van de amerikanen hopelijk kunnen jonathan en c dric zo goed mogelijk de aansluiting behouden zodat arnaud in een zo hoog mogelijke positie aan de laatste 400 m kan beginnen we proberen zo onder de drie minuten te zitten en mogelijk mee te spelen voor de derde of vierde plaats ik heb zon scenario dat we van in het begin vooraan zitten liever dan dat we al van bij de start achteraan hangen
6990102 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
6990103 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
6990104 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6990105 who among us is going to be able on day one to step in an end the war who among us understands what to do about pakistan who among us is going to pick up the phone and immediately interface with putin and tell him to lay off georgia because saakashvili is in real trouble who among us knows what theyre doing i have 35 years of experience
6990106 but 20 years of experience that has not been very solid in terms of projecting what was going to happen just doesnt make you a better commander in chief
6990107 we dont need as a commander in chief a war hero johns a war hero we need someone with some wisdom
6990108 we zijn in het olympisch dorp leuk onthaald door de andere atleten en we hebben champagne gedronken
6990109 daarna zijn we naar het restaurant in het dorp geweest en hebben we een frietje en een hamburger gegeten om de schade in te halen daarna hebben we nog een stapje in de wereld gezet het was al licht toen we in ons bed lagen
6990110 vanavond is het feest al weten we nog niet welke verplichtingen we allemaal nog hebben maar we gaan zeker buiten het olympisch dorp vieren
6990111 ik heb de wedstrijd nog een aantal keer in mijn hoofd gelopen ik besef het eigenlijk nog altijd niet als we straks op het podium onze medaille krijgen zal het misschien pas echt doordringen
6990112 ik ben heel dankbaar dat dit nog uit de bus is gevallen
6990113 dit is een fantastische afsluiter van een fantastisch project niemand had dit acht jaar geleden kunnen voorzien maar toch we zijn gestart met gemotiveerde trainers en loopsters eerst hebben we het belgisch record verbeterd en ons geplaatst voor het wk daarna is het in een stroomversnelling geraakt toen we in 2002 vierde werden op het ek in m nchen besefte iedereen dat we iets heel moois konden realiseren
6990114 het voordeel van iets dat al zeven jaar bestaat is dat je altijd mensen hebt die onderaan inschuiven en verder kunnen doorgroeien
6990115 ik hoop dat we nog een aantal jaren verder kunnen
6990116 of ik na het vertrek van kim nu de rol van leidster overneem ik denk dat dit team niet echt een kopman nodig heeft bij kim is dat op een natuurlijke manier gegroeid maar iedereen kent elkaar nu al door en door dat we gewoon n team zijn
6990117 eerste mainstream afro amerikaan was die goed kan praten intelligent en schoon is en die er goed uitziet
6990118 we simply want the federation to work with the national federation to just put to bed once and for all the questions
6990119 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6990120 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6990121 its time to enjoy our moment we played a really bad game against the u s you know but now we learn a lot from that experience and we want to try to win the finals
6990122 we are going to be ready for sure we are going to play better than the other game that is no question we are in the finals for something and we are going to try to win
6990123 i was just trying to play the game they were just down there trying to be physical i was trying to be physical back with them
6990124 it was a little bit chirpy out there but nothing personal nothing major they were trying to win and we were trying to win
6990125 theyre not a group i need to motivate a whole lot
6990126 its very important for us to leave a good image
6990127 this medal means a lot to our people it could be the last medal

6990141 the business of theology is to make sure that our questions to the scriptures of any religious tradition will be directed in such a way as to allow ourselves to be challenged and even shaken at the deepest levels of our existence by what the text says
6990142 this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die i am the living bread which came down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever and the bread that i will give is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world the jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you except ye eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day
6990143 jesus speaks the divine name and we infer that it is his to use isa 45 23

6990146 what we have put together is a kind of one stop shopping opportunity for customers to install solar systems with no out of pocket expenses
6990147 certainly with this interest rate there will be opportunities for customers to save money on a monthly basis
6990148 our goal is to achieve or exceed compliance with the requirement
6990149 in the past weve had finance entities weve worked with but we have referred customers to those entities and they would negotiate rates
6990150 that will be the big trigger point if this thing is going to be a success
6990151 aps is doing what i as an installer think should be done to get things moving forward
6990152 aps has gone from being not very progressive in their rebates to being one of the best in the country in the last six months
6990153 but do most people do it for that reason no
6990154 what you can do is lock your utility rate in for the next 30 years or so
6990155 obviously we want to look at the interest rates and fine print in the contracts
6990156 assuming its reasonable this opens the door to a lot of people without a program where this can be financed youre leaving it to just the most wealthy people to take advantage
6990157 we wanted to get people to step up to the plate and start doing some things

6990196 this is the most important piece of housing related legislation in more than a generation
6990197 the provisions in this bill will give lenders servicers and borrowers another tool to help keep families in their homes it will also help stabilize the housing and capital markets
6990198 this new legislation will go a long way to help stabilize the housing market and make the dream of homeownership more attainable for many americans also more families will be able to refinance into safer more affordable mortgages
6990199 by expanding homeownership opportunities and protecting families against foreclosure we are helping keep the american dream alive
6990200 voglio tenerti fuori specie perch sei felice in questo periodo
6990201 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6990202 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6990203 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6990204 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6990205 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6990206 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6990207 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6990208 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6990209 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6990210 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

6990213 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6990214 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6990215 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6990216 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6990217 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6990218 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6990219 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6990220 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6990221 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions

6990223 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6990224 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6990225 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6990226 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6990227 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6990228 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6990229 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6990230 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6990231 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6990232 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6990233 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6990234 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6990235 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6990236 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6990237 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6990238 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6990239 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6990240 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6990241 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6990242 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6990243 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6990244 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6990245 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6990246 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6990247 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6990248 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6990249 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6990250 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6990251 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6990252 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6990253 who are open to doing something on the production side
6990254 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6990255 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6990256 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

6990259 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6990260 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6990261 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6990262 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6990263 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6990264 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6990265 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6990266 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6990267 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6990268 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6990269 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6990270 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6990271 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6990272 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6990273 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6990274 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6990275 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6990276 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6990277 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6990278 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6990279 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6990280 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6990281 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6990282 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

6990311 i write a lot of the software that we use to drive all of this partially because you cant just buy off the shelf software that you plug music into and animation comes up its not the way stuff is usually done
6990312 we can start an animation from any number of angles
6990313 you could start literally writing all the music first and then deciding what the instruments look like weve done that before we could actually design a whole instrument without figuring out any music for it to play until its done and weve done that as well or the ideal way to do it is where youre co developing the music and the instruments together

6990456 you must have heard about the story of lakhinder and behula lakhinder was once bitten by a snake and died soon after that but then his wife behula prayed to mansa devi who then after being pleased with her granted back her husbands life to him since then our forefathers made this a tradition to worship mansa devi by getting bitten by snakes with this faith that mansa devi would save them anyhow

6990486 dropping a baton isnt bad luck its bad execution responsibility for the relay debacle lies with many people and many groups from administration to coaches to athletes thats why when these games are completed we will conduct a comprehensive review of all our programs
6990487 we could win the gold medal in every single track and field event but if we dont win a single thing in the sprints and relays the public will view our performance as a disaster
6990488 when we drop the baton in back to back relay races the public views our performance as a disaster
6990489 i think you have to look at it in the totality of what theyve been able to do over the quadrennium in world championships and world cups and the games
6990490 when the mens marathon concludes tomorrow well still be the worlds no 1 team in terms of medal count

6990494 he was held down and someone essentially shoved a hose in his face forcing a stream of water down his nose mouth and into his lungs i guess
6990495 for us in the united states were pleased with the results of the discussion and i remain very optimistic that were going to continue to make progress toward this important goal
6990496 we had expected them to have a new draft ready today but apparently there were so many amendments and problems that they didnt get it done in time
6990497 its a very sad day its a very emotional day
6990498 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
6990499 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
6990500 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgement and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6990501 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
6990502 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6990503 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6990504 people are now talking about the same idea in the same language
6990505 our position is we are going to go forward we are preparing for trial
6990506 if the major political party believes that he is the most talented person then he is the most eligible person for this post
6990507 now it depends on him whether he himself becomes president or nominates someone else
6990508 a problem with a temperature sensor may not matter at all or it can be very important depending on what other circumstances accompany it
6990509 we will have to see what other issues were present
6990510 clearly the breakdown was important enough for the pilot to halt the maneuver and have it reviewed
6990511 a set of causes probably came together to cause the accident
6990512 what am i doing stuck here in this huge hotel when my children have been moved 30 kilometres away i want to be with them
6990513 they really want to go home so they can get on with their lives
6990514 that is the way they will best deal with this situation
6990515 he thought it was a movie and asked where his father was and when the movie would end
6990516 in the past i used to intervene in politics due to the absence of institutions
6990517 we need to work on something that we could perhaps call a constitution to move forward the jamahiriya era
6990518 this is not a farm to inherit dont tell me that i am the son of gadhafi and therefore i am going to take over power
6990519 we will make sure that this provocation is not taking place
6990520 russians have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
6990521 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
6990522 we havent seen that yet its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6990523 ongoing efforts to create positive and lasting peace in the region and progress towards the shared goal of a peace agreement in 2008
6990524 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6990525 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6990526 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6990527 we struggled the last couple years i was there and we could come back and get someplace
6990528 we got healthy and got better theyve never really gotten healthy i could never sit here and gloat knowing all these players i got close to were having to struggle
6990529 even if i was angry at certain things i would have a tough time not being able to root for those players individually
6990530 look at this we must be close to new york
6990531 there is a convergence of interests now in a change in the roles and missions for american forces and for reductions of troop numbers
6990532 its not done until its done and the discussions are really ongoing and ongoing and ongoing but hopefully drawing to a conclusion
6990533 we will make sure that this provocation is not taking place
6990534 i havent been myself for the last 24 hours and i dont know why
6990535 absolutely id be lying if i said i didnt but im really happy i was able to take home a medal for canada

6990543 access to this web site is prevented by its owners free will
6990544 the access to this web site is prevented by court order
6990545 blockings are arbitrary moreover these became routine acts our campaign was an experiment to demonstrate how the internet would look if censorship continues unabated and we did that we wanted to shock people
6990546 we wanted to attract attention to the fact that our freedom is taken away day by day today they shut down the internet and tomorrow it will come to newspapers and magazines
6990547 such blockings should cease to be routine practice people get used to them if one web site is blocked they turn to another they are not conscious about censorship this is really dangerous
6990548 authorities do not know how to deal with the internet therefore they shut web sites down as they see fit
6990549 web sites are shut down without proper justification its totally arbitrary
6990550 of course there will be limitations do you think that everything is free in other countries
6990551 however these need to be done by taking into account the opinion of wider sections of the society
6990552 although it was a rather late reaction i believe it is an appropriate protest
6990553 the internet law in turkey is too complex and creates a confusion of concepts moreover its philosophy is based upon bans blocking is one thing controlling is another
6990554 we are thinking of creating a forum where web site users would discuss the internet situation in turkey as zargan we have over one million users then we will publish a booklet of these discussions and send it to the authorities
6990555 anybody in my position as a backup would be youve got to have fun with it especially it being my first chance to start im really looking forward to it
6990556 its my first time doing that in a while i should probably start running i dont know why im talking to you guys for so long
6990557 or just doing my job you cant look at anything more than that
6990558 he was able to take them down and get some scores he handled himself pretty well he was able to pick up blitzes he was elusive and got away from some pressure i think he did a lot of things well
6990559 the thing people underestimate is those guys are so good it doesnt take a whole lot to get on the same page
6990560 donte coming in this year has done a great job fitting in the system
6990561 hes worked hard and put himself in a good position to go out and relax and have fun
6990562 hes progressing and he keeps learning every time hes out there hes got a great mind for the game and he really works and prepares hard thats the type of personality he is
6990563 i want as much as i can get with the guys im going to be throwing to and now im limited with their two situations all i can say and all they can say is were going to do everything we can to get ready for that sept 7 opener if we dont have a full game plan in because were not comfortable with some of the stuff theyd normally run then well go with a smaller game plan
6990564 i think t j needs more time on the practice field than he thinks he needs
6990565 its a mans industry and its never going to change there is no use pointing out our stand verbally or through action
6990566 there is a limited choice for actresses who are already involved in a relationship
6990567 your personal life has an indirect impact on the offers that come your way once you are bonded into any relationship the choice is limited and one has to make right moves
6990568 it all depends on the kind of behaviour that the person in front of you shows if someone acts friendly then i will behave in the same manner
6990569 i never had a chance to understand her but now the awkwardness is gone
6990570 if we treat all of the lettuce and spinach then theres going to be a very rare instance of exposure to illness causing microorganisms
6990571 whats sad is that the fda after a nearly nine year review selected only two products involved with the massive illnesses in 2006
6990572 i suspect it will take awhile for the supply chain to get into place because of the limited number of irradiation facilities in place in the u s
6990573 these facilities are relatively expensive to build so you have to make sure you have adequate product flow and a market for that product
6990574 it would have to be new construction thats for sure
6990575 we wouldnt expect any immediate adoption and in fact industry wont move forward unless they are sure there wont be a backlash from consumer activists the other issue is that there is a lot more product now being labeled organic and you cannot irradiate products labeled organic
6990576 theres been a lot of research done on that and basically products that have treated with irradiation are as good or better after 14 days typical travel time than those that havent
6990577 we now know that in order to kill e coli on this type of product we can turn down the dosage level the power of the beam effectively and lettuce and spinach remain just as crisp and wholesome as if you grew it yourself
6990578 the american consumer has shown willingness to purchase irradiated products such as strawberries and meats once consumers understand the food safety implications their unfounded worries about the safety of the cold pasteurization process are eliminated even though there are a lot of naysayers and anti irradiation people giving inaccurate information
6990579 the experience with ground beef is that consumers have not reacted negatively to the label
6990580 the only negative reaction is to price it costs more
6990581 in 2006 there were an estimated 50 billion servings of green leafy salads served in this country and there were approximately 1 200 people made ill
6990582 the odds of getting a food borne illness from produce are already extremely low based upon the number of servings that we see but what we have to recognize is that irradiation is one more tool we can use to ensure the safety of our products this is especially important for at risk populations immune compromised folks pregnant women children under the age of eight and elderly these people are at high risk for food borne illness and it may be useful to feed them greens that have been irradiated for that last margin of safety
6990583 the real importance of this rule is that produce companies wouldnt even look at the technology unless the government approved it
6990584 we are worried about him but we are also proud of him
6990585 norbus case puts the suffering of the tibetans in tibet on the agenda making sure it is not forgotten and calling for serious steps to finally be made on the side of the chinese government to peacefully end the brutal oppression of the tibetan people which has been going on for nearly 60 years
6990586 there is demand for google search despite what the carriers put in front of them
6990587 weve seen a ton of carrier deals with search providers in the past two years
6990588 all these deals havent moved the needle in the same way that one device with a good browser and a good search user experience has
6990589 y was serious and dark and grounded in reality where doctor who is quite playful it does affect my mood at the table ive noticed
6990590 the trick is to find a way to graphically impersonate these characters their gestures and expressions so that it feels natural in the end its either spot on or something your uncle does at christmas dinner i dont know how close i am to the former fingers crossed its not the latter
6990591 maybe im just happy to be drawing so many men after drawing a gazillion women for the last seven years
6990592 that only just occurred to me a couple of weeks ago and it actually made me giggle
6990593 the power of the subconscious is a surprising and mysterious thing
6990594 at first i was thinking to have something elaborate on the floor beneath the doctor to make the first page splash really pop
6990595 but it should also have some meaning behind it and not just be some pretty eye candy that made me think of the seal of rassilon but since it makes an appearance on the next page it shouldnt be the actual seal and celtic knot work wouldnt really work but i wanted something like that elaborate and a little complex like the trouble hes in
6990596 i went online and started looking at tile work and this one piece jumped out at me it was an italian floor created by cosmati
6990597 i know it seems like a crazy amount of extra work for an easter egg but its those things that make the work more fun as you go its something i did a lot of on y and its a hard habit to break
6990598 when i was six i lived in finland for about a year and what television there was and of those the ones in english were all itv shows the phoenix and the carpet the muppets toms mindnight garden i claudius and grange hill they were all shows i enjoyed and they had a really specific look about them we later moved to toronto and i remember my aunt watching this show on tvontario that had that look there was a guy in a crazy long scarf and a girl dressed like andy pandy running around a nuclear power plant as a disembodied rock hand growled eldrad must live and it scared me silly i was hooked
6990599 i love the new stories like i loved those old fourth doctor ones especially with tennant who captures the doctors personality so beautifully that manic enthusiasm
6990600 but now theres the added bonus of seeing it from an adult perspective theres more of an appreciation for the story probably the best way to put it baker is the doctor of my childhood but tennant is my doctor today
6990601 there are a bunch of stories percolating in my head that id like to write
6990602 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee watch the first obama biden rally live at 3pm et on www barackobama com spread the word
6990603 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6990604 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
6990605 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
6990606 on average they have been asking for a 7 percent increase
6990607 as americans drive less because of the price of gas fewer claims will be filed with insurance companies
6990608 whether this will mean windfall profits for insurers or rate cuts for the consumers is up to governors and state regulators to determine
6990609 a lot of them say we dont regulate rates so we dont care
6990610 higher inflation and the commodities price boom increases the cost of steel plastic paint aluminum copper and everything else used to repair a vehicle
6990611 when prices have been low theres pressure for them to go up
6990612 overhaul the auto insurance pricing structure in florida based on short term developments
6990613 that is not something weve heard about in any other state
6990614 gives a new perspective on the english civil war through the eyes of angelica fanshawe riseborough who is drawn to the anti monarchist cause at a time when england executed its king in favor of an alternative form of government
6990615 considering the british traditions of free speech and the individual and the british suspicion of organized crowds we would want to avoid the leni riefenstahl connotations which were there in beijing and the ceremony was too long

6990617 shoes and apparel make up the largest percentage of school shopping and thats where consumers feel most comfortable paying with credit
6990618 with holiday shopping just around the corner this is a bad time to add to ones consumer debt parents need to have a plan to pay off those school expenses before the holiday gift giving season hits
6990619 the best policy is to pay for back to school purchases with cash
6990620 if you must pay with a credit card have a plan in place to pay that card off in full as soon as you receive a statement
6990621 if you are unable to pay it in full keep in mind monthly credit card payments are calculated as the percent of your current outstanding balance the monthly payment called for on your credit card statement will decrease as your balance is paid down and only paying the minimum called for on the statement can greatly increase the length of time and amount of interest you pay
6990622 additionally the length of time to pay off a credit card is greater the higher the interest rate and keep in mind any low promotional interest rates that are only good for a short period

6990625 we want girls to feel that nuneez headbands are the design equivalents of fashion accessories such as jewelry purses and shoes
6990626 and we think girls will immediately see the fun in designing their own fashion accessories and in comparing sharing their design add ons with other girls our production dream though is that demand will make it feasible to roll out new design releases thats a collectibles hallmark
6990627 a dream became complete with this win to participate at the biggest poker tournament in africa is for me personally something very special to stay in one of the most beautiful hotels in the world is almost inapprehensible

6990638 that would be the next dream but its a different time now than it was when jenner and those guys competed
6990639 in most countries they know who the decathlon champion is but in the us its been pushed to the back burner
6990640 it probably was the hardest decathlon ive ever done in my life through all the extremes and weather conditions
6990641 then got up at 5 oclock this morning to start all over again
6990642 at all times i knew bryan was out of reach
6990643 we said all along that this would be the olympics where we were going to make it happen
6990644 just knowing i had to finish wasnt any comfort knowing i still had to put one foot ahead of the other for 5 minutes and 6 seconds was a challenge but i knew that if i finished i would win the gold medal
6990645 i want you to be at the finish line when im done
6990646 it meant something for me to have him there i was there when he won and i wanted him to be there when i won
6990647 it was just about me giving him the crown for the next four years
6990648 i get to be a part of history now in the us
6990649 the thought of some little kid saying i want to be a decathlete like bryan clay blows my mind its probably one of the most amazing things in the world
6990650 they are playing the way we are supposed to see an american team play
6990651 weve been playing as a team for the last two years
6990652 they came here with great expectations as they always do
6990653 we heard all about the new camaraderie and so forth and we all wanted to know is it rhetoric well its true theyve been exemplary of course in the end theres no substitute for talent
6990654 you cannot win if you dont practice hard they want it they want it more than they did two years ago you can see the difference just by the way they are for the national anthem they act the way you want to see your team act during their national anthem
6990655 we have been preparing four years to get to this point
6990656 never in my career have i felt it this was the most important game of my life even more than the nba finals and the one on sunday will be more important
6990657 you know im always happy to play with any of the newcomers and give them a little bit of how do you say like cheer them up and give them some confidence
6990658 i think as an up and comer or as a rookie on the team its always nice when you play with one that has played some ryder cups
6990659 well see but im sure that nick will do a great job and will mix everybody up nicely
6990660 i have neither of my two partners from the last ryder cup
6990661 i mean olazabal will be there but as a vice captain
6990662 it is a good course youve got to do a lot of good things the greens are tough but i didnt think the scoring was going to be this low and when hunter goes out and shoots that nine under round it shows you that it is capable and it is out there
6990663 no question especially thursday morning to friday afternoon its a different golf course the greens are definitely bouncy and firmer and definitely played tougher
6990664 ill do it but im not sure ill like it

6990667 a dion government would sit down with the provincial government and engage both the government of nova scotia and nova scotia power in a constructive discussion on how to help nova scotia make the green shift and we would invest in it

6990671 he is being completely dishonest and dishonourable he obviously has an agenda more focused on his own self preservation than the interest of nova scotia he is looking for a golden parachute

6990673 proven himself very capable of getting down into the gutter
6990674 playing the drum and singing the songs is a good way to learn the words and the culture
6990675 they are getting a cultural presentation every time they sit at the drum and play and sing
6990676 i dont want them to forget who they are and where they came from
6990677 i dont want them to forget the language which is thousands and thousands of years old i want them to pass it on to their children and their grandchildren and their great grandchildren so it will never be forgotten
6990678 it is very special to me that i get to do this
6990679 i like to be here to learn the mikmaq words and to meet new people
6990680 its something that we planned for and contingencies were in place
6990681 its something youd expect because this site did have other types of activities on it in the past
6990682 its getting cleaner but not clean enough that theyd really want to swim yet or eat the fish more because of the industrial pollutants than from all the human waste going in
6990683 given that the harbour has got a relatively clean bill of health at the moment and assuming that people are cooking the fish properly i wouldnt be concerned about it personally
6990684 if somebody was relying entirely on this as their major source of protein in other words if it was a really significant part of their diet as opposed to an occasional part of their diet then i would say maybe somebody should do some health checks just to make sure not on the individual but rather on the quality of the fish but i certainly think theres no reason to get terribly concerned about this
6990685 it is indeed reasonable to say that theres a clean bill of health for the harbour fairly quickly after the sewage has been properly treated
6990686 as someone who is fairly risk conscious and at the same time really interested in environmental protection and improved environment i wouldnt worry in the least bit about swimming in the harbour but i might think twice about eating fish just now because thats like a step further
6990687 i think the fish that i probably feel most comfortable eating from the harbour would be mackerel because theyre a migratory fish
6990688 if they were to come into the harbour they wouldnt have been here for long and they dont stay for long or theyre moving around more things like harbour pollock or cod i might be less inclined to eat the longer the fish lives in these waters perhaps the greater the chance or probability of contamination
6990689 we know still that even with advanced primary treatment when you get the storm water overflow they close the harbour for swimming because of the elevated levels of fecal coliform

6990693 het was onmenselijk je kon bijna niet ademhalen het was erg moeilijk om te rennen de hitte was afschuwelijk
6990694 ho avuto modo di assistere solo ai primi minuti della gara contro la juventus ma devo dire che la squadra azzurra mi sembrata ben organizzata ed anche tonica sul piano fisico mi sono piaciuti molto gli esterni che aggredivano sempre i portatori di palla e quando hanno avuto la possibilit si sono proposti anche in fase offensiva diciamo che come test stato indicativo ma non fondamentale perch cerano molti giocatori assenti chi cera per non ha assolutamente demeritato
6990695 per poter competere su pi fronti nel calcio attuale bisogna disporre di una rosa molta ampia il napoli forse avrebbe bisogno di altri
6990696 sul risultato finale influir moltissimo la condizione fisica di entrambe le squadre chi avr pi minuti nelle gambre vincer ad inizio campionato i valori tecnici non contano tanto come ogni anno ci saranno risultati inaspettati alla prima giornata non trascurerei nemmeno il fattore ambientale perch far ancora molto caldo e questo incider ancora di pi sulla resistenza dei giocatori prevedo una partita tirata da ex calciatore di entrambe le squadre spero di assistere soltanto ad una festa di sport e non a scene di guerriglia urbana spero che i tifosi abbiano capito che lo sport fatto di passione non di odio
6990697 santacroce nonostante la sua et dimostra di avere gi il carisma necessario per imporsi in un gruppo di giocatori pi affermati sul piano tecnico rapido attento e sempre puntuale negli interventi credo che possa fare molto comodo alla nazionale anche perch capitan cannavaro gi avanti con let e santacroce potrebbe essere il suo erede ideale li vedrei benissimo anche in coppia insieme limpeto di santacroce e la classe di cannavaro sarebbe veramente una difesa invalicabile
6990698 quando arrivai in maglia azzurra la squadra era composta da molti stranieri e sul piano dei risultati la situazione gi era critica la squadra oramai gi navigava in brutte acque dopo laddio di mister mazzone lo spogliatoio si spacc ancora di pi e non ci fu pi modo di porre rimedio disputai solo poche partite tra cui una in coppa italia condita da un gol contro la lazio
6990699 una scelta di cuore da romano doc non mi sentivo di abbandonare i colori della mia citt speravo di diventare una bandiera giallorossa in parte ci sono riuscito c solo il rammarico di non aver chiuso la mia carriera nella capitale nel 1992 dopo un rigore fallito in un derby con la lazio i miei rapporti con la propriet si incrinarono irreparabilmente
6990700 mi piace molto aquilani un giocatore con enormi qualit ma deve crescere ancora nelle categorie inferiori direi musacci dellempoli e gennaro esposito che avr il piacere di allenare questanno a gallipoli un giovane che credo non abbia espresso ancora tutte le sue enormi potenzialit

6990703 ive had parents come in who have no idea what montessori entails but theyve just heard that montessori is a good school and they register their child
6990704 even if theyre not interested in signing up their child with my school if they just want to come by to get information see a classroom see the materials im always willing to give out as much information as possible on this philosophy
6990705 but i dont think i should have to pay to have my car fixed for something that was their fault
6990706 chebucto road in general is very frustrating because there are so many people doing work there
6990707 his conclusion was there was no negligence on our part
6990708 its really overwhelming to have all these people here in support of me
6990709 i was home a couple of months ago and it was a bit of a buzz going on but nothing like this
6990710 its a really humbling experience to have everybody loving your son the way they are
6990711 were pretty proud of how mitchell is conducting himself and were just happy that everyone is getting to feel that we have grandmothers little children and a wide range in between who are supporting him and loving that personality
6990712 there are vocalists that are probably better than mitchell but he does his best and theres this other part of the competition where people just love who they love
6990713 he seems to love his indie music and thats where he seems to get his inspiration he loves a song that tells a story
6990714 right from the top i said that i wanted to stick to my guns in my taste in music
6990715 i think im going to remain to do that ive gotten away with playing some not well known stuff and its gotten me this far
6990716 no matter where you go mitch is the first topic that comes up
6990717 when he was four he would sing gaelic songs in the kitchen
6990718 i can still see him with his little voice and big blue eyes
6990719 hes such a down to earth individual hes humble but has a lot of confidence at the same time
6990720 i voted for him 300 times on a pay phone
6990721 we had a tv in the trailer so i watched every single week

6990728 proven himself very capable of getting down into the gutter
6990729 its very hard to get it to be the primary issue particularly for politicians who are making budget decisions because they are not getting the same pressure about mental health as they get about cancer and coronary disease and diabetes
6990730 we working from the opportunity we have within government organizations such as the national association and the nova scotia association and other groups and all of us collectively need to be doing something much more significant to make this a burning bridge issue for decision makers
6990731 i think one of the challenges around mental illness is that its unique properties include affecting our thinking our moods and our behaviour the very dimensions that define us as individuals
6990732 that makes it a lot tougher to separate the illness from the person
6990733 the reality of mental illness its mundane reality is virtually never depicted
6990734 the same applies to the newspapers because somebody recovering from mental illness or somebody simply making a great adaptation to mental illness is about as newsworthy as a plane landing safely at the airport
6990735 think of how far it has come in the ensuing 25 years
6990736 its really an extraordinary social transformation mental illness has not come anywhere near as far as hiv

6990755 playing the drum and singing the songs is a good way to learn the words and the culture
6990756 they are getting a cultural presentation every time they sit at the drum and play and sing
6990757 i dont want them to forget who they are and where they came from
6990758 i dont want them to forget the language which is thousands and thousands of years old i want them to pass it on to their children and their grandchildren and their great grandchildren so it will never be forgotten
6990759 it is very special to me that i get to do this
6990760 i like to be here to learn the mikmaq words and to meet new people
6990761 who will start something will we kiss how far will we go will the boss be angry if nothing happens what if we dont like each other
6990762 it is wonderful raymond and for a country girl like me this is quite different its a real buzz
6990763 i mean when i said i would come here tonight i was not sure if you were a lesbian
6990764 no im not a lesbian jenny dont be afraid of me good looking men like your boss really turn me on but i dont make it much with younger ones most of them havent got a clue after 30 they start to get some sophistication into their lovemaking but older men yes
6990765 to be honest even though i love making it with a man i get a greater sense of release kissing and touching another woman
6990766 they were very strict with me i had to kneel by the bed at night and say prayers but never was allowed to wear pyjamas or nighties we all slept in one big king size bed mom and pop on each side when mom taught me how to kiss and other things i had to show pop that i was learning properly
6990767 mind you i look back and wish he had so many times i really love my stepdaddy and to this day i wish i knew how i could get him to have it with me he is so handsome and physical for his age he does turn me on
6990768 i dress rather provocatively at work in my mini skirts and things i know my boss can see through to turn him on i like to feel i can control him by controlling his attention i get off on using my mind power as well as my body
6990769 at night i can touch myself and think of how i must make him twist up inside and want me and how he probably jerks off thinking about me i do get his attention by being a bit cheeky
6990770 i must admit some of my early lessons at home have stayed with me and i guess in all respects my parents were very much into erotica you know the kind of games they played with me
6990771 you know what you should do to get your stepdaddys attention play one of the games i had to play one night when he is watching tv come out and put a beach towel on the floor in front of him between where he is sitting and the tv so he cant help but notice what you are doing
6990772 anyway darling just come out with a bath robe wrapped around you and a jar of honey adults love eating honey lie down on your back and pour the honey thick on your pussy and smear it over your breasts
6990773 you can bet he will be dumbfounded and locked on to what you are doing just say in your most innocent voice oh daddy my honey pot is overflowing and ive spilt honey over me please lick it up for your sweetie pie
6990774 laura that is fantastic i can just see it now if he doesnt get down on me after that kind of opportunity i should give up
6990775 oh he will he will and jenny it is a really great feeling especially when you feel their tongue lapping into you
6990776 oh yes always but that was just one of many games we played and i didnt know any better at the time except that everything felt really good and they never harmed me
6990777 so jenny being bi all started with kissing and went on from there they taught me that our tongue is a wonderful sex organ or maybe better put an organ for sex it was fun discovering my erogenous zones so early i would probably never have known i guess some of that erotic naughtiness stays with me and i find it exciting to share my love with a man or a woman even a couple together although i havent done that yet
6990778 well jenny i think that our brain is our most powerful aphrodisiac you know the power us women have in our emotions are much more powerful than mens in my opinion at least the mind is our greatest source of inspiration for everything we do and when it comes to personal relationships and sex generally the mind is probably our number one sex organ
6990779 gee laura we think so much alike thats how i always feel about it too
6990780 well jenny its an organ for creating sexual pleasure thats what i mean and everything surely must start in the mind dont you think
6990781 oh yes my boss raymond has a great imagination and he is the one who wants me to make love to you
6990782 ah see what i mean jenny dont you think hes done that for my benefit your benefit and his own kinky benefit i think your boss is a very nice looking man having just met him at the bar but i bet his mind works overtime turning you into more than a figment of his imagination he will be wondering all night what we are up to and no doubt filling his mind with all kinds of erotic possibilities
6990783 do you mean he wants me to have sex with you because that turns him on
6990784 why did he give me a picture of someone younger than you and making out it was you why would he do that
6990785 jenny i gave my uncle a picture of me as i am today to pass on to your boss and he switched it maybe in case you thought i was too old for you in this sort of dalliance
6990786 gee laura i dont think you look too old for anything you are very very attractive sort of like the girl next door
6990787 jenny i know this much i am 30 to be honest and i am at the time when women are usually around their sexual peak still young in the body but a lot more experienced than women 10 years younger like you
6990788 i think women my age are hotter sexually in passion than at any other stage of their lives and here i am living in a little country town where my chances of getting off with a man or a woman for that matter are very limited compared to you living here in a big city
6990789 you know jenny you are one hell of a sexy young woman i think i can enjoy being close to you tonight and it will be a very very long night
6990790 this dress cost me a fortune so im putting it aside so i can wear it outside and not look like ive been rolling around on the ground
6990791 i like she shade of your lippy jenny it seems to make your lips really mmmm
6990792 your boobs are so good you dont need to wear a bra you know
6990793 when did you first have sex with another woman outside the home or am i the first she asks laura
6990794 it was after my parents broke up and i was in my final year at school
6990795 i agreed because of that to go to her house two nights a week for personalised coaching to catch up as she called it
6990796 for the life of me i cant recall the very thing that started something off but she was asking me questions about how i felt about myself and suggested i was very tense and needed to let go a bit
6990797 i remember telling her thats only because of the uncertainty of passing my exams she put her arm around me as we sat on the couch and said all i needed was some reassurance before i knew it she started cuddling me and saying i had lips that men would die for she pushed me back on the couch and had her mouth over mine her tongue inside me and i suddenly melted
6990798 i was taken by surprise i was too scared to fight her off and i started to like what she was doing her hand went down under my short skit and she was running her fingers all over the outside of my lace knickers without realising it i found myself opening my legs wider for her as her fingers probed along my slit and got me quite wet down there
6990799 well she ended up giving me a climax the first woman to do that outside opf my home funny thing though i was not angry with her when it was all over in fact i even thanked her which now at my age must sound really corny
6990800 laura please show me what she actually did to you and how she did it i want to know what it must have felt like when you were still at school and she was your teacher just hearing makes me feel horny

6990862 its a little disappointing i i mean you know john mccain likes to characterize himself as a maverick but the truth is what hes done particularly over the last month when he shook up his campaign is he basically hired karl roves old old crew and adopted karl roves old tactics which really had to do with suggesting that i was unpatriotic
6990863 i want to make the choice clear to the american people for the last eight years weve had a particular set of economic policies that have resulted in record foreclosures high unemployment high inflation and so i want the american people to focus on whether or not we can afford to continue those policies for another four or eight years because thats essentially what john mccains offering

6990876 die beiden pole eines ausgepr gt modernen bewusstseins sind nostalgie und utopie
6990877 das vielleicht interessanteste merkmal der zeit die heute als die sechzigerjahre etikettiert wird war die tatsache dass es so wenig nostalgie gab in dem sinne handelte es sich tats chlich um einen utopischen moment
6990878 wo findet sich das eingest ndnis dass dies kein feiger angriff auf die zivilisation oder die freiheit oder die menschheit oder die freie welt war sondern ein angriff auf die selbst ernannte supermacht dieser erde unternommen infolge ganz bestimmter allianzen und aktionen auf die amerika sich eingelassen hat und was das wort feige angeht so trifft es auf leute die vom himmel herab und unerreichbar f r jegliche vergeltung t ten wohl eher zu als auf jene die bereit sind zu sterben um andere zu t ten zur frage des mutes einer moralisch neutralen tugend nur dies was immer man ber jene sagen mag die das blutbad vom dienstag angerichtet haben feiglinge waren sie nicht
6990879 warum ist schreiben so wichtig haupts chlich wegen egoismus nehme ich an weil ich diese person sein will ein schriftsteller und nicht weil da etwas w re was ich sagen muss aber warum nicht auch deshalb mit etwas ich modellierung wie mithilfe dieses tagebuches sollte ich auch die sicherheit gewinnen dass ich ich etwas zu sagen habe das gesagt werden sollte

6990887 immer noch eine lebensspr hende idee das war vor den kapitulationen die sich in der vorstellung der postmoderne verk rpern
6990888 wie wundervoll das alles im r ckblick erscheint wie sehr man sich w nschte dass ein wenig von der k hnheit dem optimismus der verachtung f r den kommerz berlebt h tte die zeit in der wir leben wird nicht als utopischer moment erfahren sondern als das ende genauer gesagt als die zeit unmittelbar nach dem ende jedweder ideale heute kommt den meisten menschen allein schon die idee des ernsthaften und des ehrenhaften kurios vor unrealistisch

6990901 thanks for citing my blog you did quite the job of twisting what i said into something completely different however not only that but you took it completely out of context the post that this quote comes from has nothing to do with artificial insemination and is not focused on the issue of cab drivers refusing passengers on a religious basis what my post was about as any readers smart enough to check sources will see is how ridiculous it is that airports are catering to their muslim cab drivers by installing foot baths in their bathrooms so that they can wash their feet before praying there is no effort being made to accommodate other religions in fact airports or other businesses shouldnt be trying to accommodate people on a religious basis at all my comment on cab drivers refusing passengers with dogs or alcohol was to show how people are going to absurd lengths to accommodate a religion that in principle will not accommodate to us you also make an illegitimate conclusion with this blog that christians or conservatives or whoever youre referring to think its ok to refuse service based on religion but muslims cant how do you come to that conclusion with the articles cited they are completely independent of each other the first article was about doctors refusing artificial insemination to gays based on their christian beliefs at no point in that article was islam even mentioned then you have my blog which makes brief reference to my negative opinion of muslim cab drivers who refuse certain passengers based on religious belief at no point in my blog did i say or even insinuate that i think it would be all right for christians to do the same christians werent even mentioned in that regard once again your conclusion was that someone was saying that it was fine for christians to refuse service based on religion but not for muslims to do the same the examples that you used to support this conclusion were that some people in california felt they could refuse service based on christian beliefs and that some unrelated guy in mississippi myself thought it was dumb that muslim cab drivers were refusing passengers based on their religious beliefs its still up to you to explain to us who exactly is saying that its ok for one but not the other you just need to do so without taking peoples statements out of context and combining unrelated opinions as if they belong to a single person or group feel free to keep using my blog as a source for your own blogs if youd like you can disagree with me all you want and express that disagreement in whatever way you deem appropriate but i ask that you at least make honest use of my blogs to form legitimate points good day

6990903 it is certainly a recognition of the quality of our work when people want to make pirated editions of lamb
6990904 of course we expected the cgp to be popular because as green building grows many consumers are looking for a builder with real credentials in todays market
6990905 as we see demand for green buildings continue to grow we are seeing the market respond as people skill up and get the appropriate training
6990906 a recent federation of master builders report showed that the value of the refurbishment market will be 4bn a year and countless studies have shown that to meet carbon emission targets there needs to be a focus on retrofitting older buildings
6990907 so there is a strong case for developing these skills even in the current climate for new build

6991039 we have a sense of how many insurance policies are sold and the department of public safety would have a sense for how many tickets theyd written
6991040 when youre driving two tons of steel at 60 miles per hour down the road you really ought to have liability insurance its just not right for some people not to do that

6991074 no housing at that time in lawrence was similar to that
6991075 i see the youth employment program as a continuation of us expanding and developing those services to meet the needs of our community and also an extension of us partnering with others in the community
6991076 we decided wed like to expand it and make career development not be just once a year for our students with disabilities
6991077 kids will get to try all these different careers and jobs to find out what their strengths are and what they need to work on when they seek
6991078 were building connections with the community as well as self esteem building for the students who are going to participate

6991083 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6991084 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
6991085 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
6991086 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6991087 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6991088 the people dont want them but when they dont have any other options they may gravitate to whats there
6991089 while limiting fast food restaurants isnt a solution in itself its an important piece of the puzzle
6991090 bringing health policy and environmental policy together with land use planning
6991091 i think thats smart and its the wave of the future
6991092 by the time i go home its already too late to cook food
6991093 later on sometimes your son is too fat he eats too much
6991094 its fast food on every corner but its not enough wholesome restaurants
6991095 you literally have to be willing to drive to long beach or santa monica or inglewood
6991096 the community has suffered for decades by an assumption that attracting business of any type is good and its not true
6991097 part of the debate is even what is fast food and its a tricky thing
6991098 everybody has an impression but when you try to write an ordinance you have to be very legalistic about it
6991099 like saying were not going to allow anybody to sell chevrolets anymore because we want people to buy nothing but mercedes benzes
6991100 its convoluted logic if the objective is to get full service upscale casual dining restaurants in an area i think the first step is finding out why theyre not coming in an area then start addressing those and start by incentivizing

6991119 in een interview dat biden in augustus vorig jaar aan de amerikaanse zender abc gaf noemde die obama voorlopig ongeschikt als president
6991120 opvallend is dat steeds meer jonge kinderen uit eenoudergezinnen komen
6991121 op 1 september zullen er dat vermoedelijk weer wat meer zijn
6991122 verschillende internaten zitten al vol op drie jaar tijd openen we maar liefst vijf nieuwe internaten een serieuze aanwijzing dus dat het goed gaat
6991123 in de regio gent zit werkelijk alles vol ik ken ouders die wanhopig op zoek zijn naar nog een plekje voor hun kind
6991124 het is het logische gevolg van de maatschappelijke evolutie dat steeds meer ouders scheiden wie alleenstaand is heeft het moeilijker om werk en zorg voor de kinderen te combineren denk maar aan een moeder die verpleegster of arbeidster is en tot 22 uur s avonds moet werken dan biedt het internaat vaak een goede oplossing
6991125 in de basisschool is het vaak de gezinssituatie die doorslaggevend is voor de inschrijving men is alleenstaande ouder en heeft het gevoel dat het kind om pedagogische redenen beter af is in een internaat men kan s avonds geen tijd vrij maken om zoon of dochter van school te halen of te begeleiden met huiswerk
6991126 ongeveer een kwart van de kinderen komt uit een eenoudergezin
6991127 alleenstaande moeders hebben het vaak niet zo gemakkelijk sommige jongens gedragen zich hier tijdens de week als lammetjes maar in het weekend bij hun mama durven ze heel moeilijk te doen we hebben een aantal moeders die dat nu rapporteren op mail zodat we hun zonen daarover op maandag kunnen aanspreken
6991128 all the wild world is beautiful and it matters but little where we go to highlands or lowlands woods or plains so universally true is this the spot where we chance to be always seems the best
6991129 onderkruiperij achterbaksheid geraffineerde stemmingmakerij alles is goed om zichzelf in de schijnwerpers te werken de partijtop blijft hier blind voor trekt de schouders op wanneer iemand aan de alarmbel trekt
6991130 ik hoef mijn politieke idealen niet te verloochenen omdat het partijprogramma van ldd nauw aansluit bij dat van vlaams belang vlaamse onafhankelijkheid gezond rechts boerenverstand een liberale maatschappijvisie met de nodige sociale correcties een correcte en harde aanpak van de criminaliteit een strikt immigratie en asielbeleid het voornaamste verschilpunt is dat ldd dit alles op een aanvaardbare en menselijke manier uitdraagt
6991131 bij de verkiezingen van juni volgend jaar zou ik de tweede plaats krijgen op de limburgse lijst van vlaams belang dat was me toegezegd de tweede plaats is een verkiesbare plaats daarvoor moet ik het dus niet doen
6991132 wat de mensen absoluut moeten weten is dat ik zelf naar jean marie dedecker ben gestapt om de redenen die ik al aanhaalde ik heb hem g n plaats gevraagd hij heeft mij niets beloofd
6991133 men zegt vaak dat ik mensen vraag om over te stappen de waarheid is dat ik nog maar twee keer zelf iemand heb gevraagd georges lenssen nadat ik een signaal had gekregen dat hij misschien wel ge nteresseerd was en de dochter van marleen govaerts ik heb john niet gevraagd hij is naar mij gestapt ik heb n week bedenktijd gevraagd ik wil niet dat ldd een opvangtehuis wordt voor misnoegde parlementsleden die op zoek zijn naar jobzekerheid
6991134 omdat hij na jan peumans misschien wel het hardst werkende vlaams parlementslid is omdat we beiden echte liberalen zijn omdat ik ervan gecharmeerd was dat hij niets vroeg n omdat we met john nu ook in limburg ldd op de kaart zetten
6991135 oh yes but what a shame what a shame the poor grooms bride is a whore
6991136 havent you people ever heard of closing the god damn door
6991137 the decay of decency in the modern age the rebellion against law and good faith the treatment of human beings as things as the mere instruments of power and ambition is without a doubt the consequence of the decay of the belief in man as something more than an animal animated by highly conditioned reflexes and chemical reactions for unless man is something more than that he has no rights that anyone is bound to respect and there are no limitations upon his conduct which he is bound to obey
6991138 ik wil horen van de deskundigen wat mogelijk is ditmoet het sluitstuk zijn van een gratis professionele basisrijopleiding voor jongeren
6991139 ongeveer 55 000 leerlingen in 720 scholen krijgen de kans omgratis het theoretisch rijexamen af te leggen op school
6991140 de leerlingen krijgen een lessenpakket van8uur verkeerseducatie de lessenbehandelen niet alleen dewegcode maar ook de themas als verkeersveiligheid en duurzame mobiliteit de scholen kunnen het lessenpakket uitbreiden
6991141 in het kleuter en basisonderwijs gaat veel aandachtnaar verkeerseducatie maar in hetmiddelbaar onderwijswas dat minder
6991142 en jongeren tussen 15 en 18 jaar zijn net de kwetsbaarste groep in het verkeer
6991143 als je vier uur voor het innemen van je medicijnen een glaasje fruitsap drinkt is er niets aan de hand
6991144 ik kan het echt niet beschrijven het leek zo gemakkelijk allemaal
6991145 iedereen heeft het echt fantastisch gedaan ik leek zelfs nog te naderen op de russische voor goud
6991146 als tweede hier over die lijn komen is te mooi voor woorden
6991147 dit is waar we allemaal van droomden het hoogste wat we kunnen bereiken
6991148 ik zag dat kerron naar de stok greep en greep en ineens niets meer
6991149 mijn cli nt ontkent alle betrokkenheid en wij kunnen alles weerleggen
6991150 we gaan in beroep tegen de beslissing van de raadkamer om zijn aanhoudingsmandaat te verleggen
6991151 ik wil weten hoe daphne van bogaert 6 uit gooreind woensdag kon worden verwisseld met een andere kleuter en in dilbeek belandde
6991152 maar we zijn ook blij dat alles goed is afgelopen
6991153 het gemeentebestuur heeft de moeder van daphne al zijn excuses aangeboden
6991154 binnen de jeugddienst en de speelpleinwerking gaan we na of alle procedures correct zijn gevolgd we onderzoeken of er aanpassingen nodig zijn ook al is de moeder van daphne in het algemeen best tevreden over onze speelpleinwerking
6991155 we trokken ons zoals afgesproken terug naar de posities voor de oorlog maar in het plan staat ook dat we in afwachting van een internationale regeling bijkomende veiligheidsmaatregelen mogen nemen en een veiligheidszone tot 7 km buiten zuid osseti mogen inrichten
6991156 we willen van in het begin al vooraan zitten daarom start kevin
6991157 we hebben de laatste dagen zo slecht geslapen maar die zilveren op de 4 x 100 meter maakt alles goed
6991158 ik durfde niet kijken mijn hart kon zoveel spanning gewoon niet aan pas toen ik hoorde dat kim de stok zonder problemen in haar handen had gekregen ben ik naar de televisie gestormd wat ik toen zag was fantastisch ik kan het nog steeds niet geloven
6991159 ik had honderd procent gehoopt dat dat zou lukken maar natuurlijk verwacht je zoiets niet zeker niet na wat er in de halve finale van de 100 meter was gebeurd we hebben de laatste dagen zo slecht geslapen maar dit maakt alles goed
6991160 belgi heeft lang op die medaille moeten wachten maar eindelijk is het gelukt dat ons land zoveel geduld moest oefenen bewijst dat een medaille op de olympische spelen behalen niet eenvoudig is daarom vind ik het dubbel zo leuk dat het mijn dochter en haar vriendinnen gelukt is een mooier afscheid van de atletieksport bestaat niet
6991161 de geboorte van mijn allereerste kleinkind gaat boven al de rest
6991162 she is good dont worry shes not in serious condition
6991163 i think the china government has done a very good job of presenting a positive image overseas but in doing so it didnt change much of its behavior to do that
6991164 this was part of the grand plan to show a new china and i think its delivered in many regards
6991165 china is trying to present itself as non threatening and in a lot of ways non socialist
6991166 theyve gone all out to try and present a country thats ancient yet super modern
6991167 they can see from the olympics the achievements of 30 years of reform and opening up and the chinese peoples good spirit
6991168 bpr telah membuat kenyataan fitnah dan berikutan itu sebua media akhbar arus perdana juga telah melaporkan berita yang tidak tepat dan palsu sehinga mencemarkan nama baik kami kami tidak ditahan di bilik di sebuah hotel sebaliknya kami berada sedang minum di restoran kluang station di depan khalayak ramai
6991169 kami akan failkan saman malu berkenaan di mahakamah tinggi isnin ini jika mereka tidak berbuat demikian memohon maaf
6991170 sehubungan itu kami menyeru penduduk permatang pauh supaya memberikan sokongan sepenuhnya kepada anwar bagi memastikan kemenangan pakatan rakyat di pilihan raya kecil berkenaan
6991171 jelas sekali kita dapat lihat bahawa bpr bukanlah satu badan bebas seperti yang digembar gemburkan dan mereka bpr masih lagi d bawah telunjuk kerajaan bn pimpinan umno
6991172 today our weekend got off to a good start but obviously it is far too early to say where we are compared to the opposition
6991173 the setup we have found today is not bad but there is still plenty of room for improvement
6991174 the first day was difficult for everybody especially to get the braking points its very hard on breaks
6991175 we keep improving the car race after race and we are in a position now to be in the top six in qualifiers and in the races to get points
6991176 considering the dustiness of the track we made a very promising start on the setup this morning
6991177 we were able to go quicker on each run without changing too much and we took a very good baseline into the afternoon session were in pretty good shape and im looking forward to tomorrow
6991178 but im happy to come here its my first win in an international major regatta
6991179 just the fact that it was my last time in optimist and right by my hometown it was great
6991180 the wind was heavy the first two days then it died off to pretty light winds and today was kind of medium
6991181 it was good it made for a fair regatta because we had all types of racing
6991182 i had good starts and i had a good mental disposition all week
6991183 i was confident and relaxed and that helped me go fast
6991184 i planned on sitting behind tim just off his shoulder and using his pace and then popping him at the end
6991185 he had a very strong pickup at the 500 and i countered it went with him a little while and then people just started blowing past me and i couldnt handle it im extremely disappointed
6991186 it was really close i mean it was right there
6991187 in the end i think i lacked a bit of energy and endurance mostly
6991188 i knew with about 100 metres left i was going to pass him
6991189 i couldnt really feel anything it was there but it was not there i knew my body was not happy but mentally i knew i had enough to hammer through to the end
6991190 its a bit surreal it was an awesome race for me i went out and raced like i know i can and like my coach told me to it really panned out it was a great one really good
6991191 over 30 000 buildings belonged to church schools before the october revolution in russia
6991192 however 95 per cent of russians consider state schools the only place for educating children in compliance with their outlook
6991193 when you think about the six seven cars that are still battling that out eight cars maybe those eight cars are in a position where finishing 12th is way better than finishing 38th
6991194 you dont want to go out there and risk running out of fuel or anything but theres not a lot you can do here
6991195 a lot of the wrecks that you end up finding yourselves in here are because of something that happened two or three cars ahead of you
6991196 this reminds me of home to tell you the truth
6991197 this looks like a course that could be very easily in the midwest somewhere it reminds me of medinah a lot the grasses are the same we putt on poa annua greens a lot where im from its bentgrass fairways bluegrass rough and everything reminds me of home
6991198 i think the course is in such good shape thats why the scoring is good
6991199 i think as we get further along the scoring could get a little bit better just because guys will find a way to play it understand it a little bit more and feel a little bit more comfortable with what they are doing out there
6991200 i probably hit it better than i did yesterday but nothing went in
6991201 i need to go out saturday and have a good day and shoot six or seven under
6991202 i tried hard but struggled to focus this afternoon it really is a knockdown after the last couple of weeks
6991203 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6991204 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6991205 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6991206 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6991207 weve got to figure out and get to a point where i dont want to miss any more time it could be better tomorrow it could be better on sunday
6991208 for whatever reason my back is really guarding against letting that spasm out
6991209 when i was asked to paint st sava it was a huge honor
6991210 being the first serbian church in america gives it a special history i felt a deep obligation to do my very best in the years since ive been working here the congregation has treated me like a family member though i travel to different places i now consider myself a member of this church
6991211 its walls are very unusual for a serbian orthodox church
6991212 theres certainly beauty in its simplicity but its also hard for an iconographer the theological canon guides us on what stories the frescos should represent we show the entire life of jesus christ through different images from his birth to the pentecost yet the icons also hearken back to saints and figures from the old testament as well all working together in a special inter related design
6991213 then we also had to look at the story in its entirety and i personally had to think about the beauty and composition of the paintings from different angles
6991214 the goal is always to breathe life into the walls
6991215 he and all of the hard working miners who built this community are an inspiration
6991216 it helps teach the story its natural sometimes for peoples eyes to wander during a service these impressive images bring them back to god and remind them why theyre here
6991217 the whole purpose of the frescos is to make people feel at home in the presence of god
6991218 people should walk in see these images and want to pray if that doesnt happen then whats the point if you dont inspire people that way you may be a really great artist but not a great iconographer i love my work because its a privilege to try to make people feel that like the priests my job is to try to tell a magnificent story the difference is i do my talking with my brushes
6991219 vlm airlines is honoured to receive this prestigious award which is a powerful endorsement of service from the people that really matter passengers we are dedicated to providing the highest levels of service and strive continually to set new standards
6991220 this award is particularly pleasing in that it demonstrates quality of service and service clearly matter to customers on short haul services vlm airlines were strongly supported in this survey category and were frequently singled out for the high standards of staff service they deliver the award is very much a recognition of the those customer facing staff
6991221 son buenas intenciones y propuestas pero es meramente un discurso porque no nos dicen c mo lo van a hacer los mecanismos que van a utilizar en cada una de las acciones que plantearon
6991222 dicen que en 100 d as deber arrojar resultados este plan pero el reto m s bien es tener las estrategias listas porque mejor no dicen qu van a hacer si no cumplen si esto no funciona lo que hace falta es un mayor compromiso porque los mexicanos nos estamos cansando y cada vez m s se demuestran los s ntomas de intolerancia por la ineficiencia de los gobiernos
6991223 hay que tener confianza en que este plan puede funcionar porque de fracasar ser a el fracaso del estado mexicano ante el desaf o m s grande de los ltimos tiempos que estamos viviendo que es el combate a la delincuencia organizada
6991224 las 74 acciones que se anuncian contra la delincuencia en m xico y su plazo de 100 d as para dar a conocer avances son cosas b sicas que debieron emprenderse desde que el gobierno federal decidi emprender la guerra frontal contra el crimen organizado
6991225 si bien se reconoce que la lucha contra el hampa no se ganar de la noche a la ma ana es necesario que el gobierno en verdad se ponga a trabajar en serio para que se puedan obtener resultados positivos
6991226 we are coming apart at the seams in every sense
6991227 nearly two months to have a pair of trousers mended which had been torn by a not completely screwed down screw on a jump seat meanwhile alitalia is back in the news with plans of new cuts they want to make but i have already made my cuts
6991228 once again we are short of cutlery so i am hard at work washing re washing and drying
6991229 there is a meal missing either it wasnt loaded or there are more passengers than we had booked
6991230 the undercarriage is nude without mudguards the plane can only fly if it doesnt rain we are fine until the end of september but only in the south nothing to put security at risk
6991231 if one is not in line with the norms and dictates alitalia does not take off
6991232 international statistics confirm that alitalia is one of the most secure airlines in the world
6991233 perhaps aviator az does not take into account the delicate situation in which we find ourselves
6991234 its a very sad day its a very emotional day
6991235 we need a place where people can have a discussion and get information
6991236 and people need to know that its not coming from an anti mormon place or a gay castro district place its coming from a faithful place
6991237 when i heard and saw the letter that the church leaders had read in sacrament meetings i was appalled
6991238 so i said thats it i want mormons to know that there are gay people in their congregations every sunday
6991239 i really just want people to try and understand and see the pain they are causing gay members of the church who are struggling
6991240 provide license to infringe or impose upon the rights and liberties of others
6991241 if there would have been a site like this it would have been really helpful
6991242 last time during prop 22 all i did was vote no this time i wanted to stand up and be heard even though its hard
6991243 there is a lot of anxiety and stress over being conflicted being an active mormon and being for gay marriage
6991244 thats part of the reason we wanted to do the site
6991245 if you think you are the only person in your ward that feels that way and the rhetoric is really loud its painful
6991246 good faith to try to stop the conflict from escalating
6991247 the law of the republic of the philippines should prevail and it will be under the law that we will prosecute them and judge them
6991248 we hope the rebels are reasonable enough to see that it does them no good to coddle these criminals
6991249 while there has been resistance the groups there have been running around because wherever they withdraw they bump into some of our battalions
6991250 can set off a chain of reprisals and only increase the danger facing civilians
6991251 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
6991252 weve all got our generators filled up with gas and oil and our nonperishable food
6991253 these were basically attacks intended to result in the social exclusion or humiliation of the speaker punctuated on occasion with profanity a nasty glare or even a solid punch to the arm
6991254 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humor in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker
6991255 being selected as an appropriate audience for a stupid joke suggests that there is something amiss with the hearers sense of humor
6991256 i told them just go out and tell bad jokes be a hero in the field
6991257 the younger you are and the closer you are in age to your failed humorist the more likely you are to attack

6991322 in my opinion each one of them would want to be there and will be there that president will want to demonstrate to the world that the u s represented by chicago wants to welcome the world back to the united states
6991323 of course he will be there and we can enjoy his support
6991324 were not going to hit the ball into the crowd but we will play some glorious shots we run really well and our fielding has really come on in the last year hopefully a lot of people will come out and watch us next summer and be impressed
6991325 its on a par with the england under 19s which i watched here the other day they dont have the same power so batting is more about placement
6991326 i dont think ive had to adapt my technique i think its just about your mindset youve just got to go out there and be really really positive and play the shots youre good at more often than you would do normally ive been quite successful so far at twenty20 by doing that
6991327 they say that in twenty20 theres more pressure on the bowler but i think theres more pressure on the batter because youre expected to score runs and get off strike which is not that easy sometimes when the bowlers are bowling well
6991328 i think youve got to have a clear idea where your fours are and where your singles are but most of all youve got to get the ball out towards the boundaries and then youve got the option of runnings twos in the womens game the team that runs the most twos is often the winner
6991329 we didnt hit as many boundaries outside the powerplays as wed have liked but thats something we can work on
6991330 i like the added pressure of them all looking to me and hopefully i can show them the right way im hard on them but im also really fair with them and i think they respect me because of that
6991331 im the first one to give them a pat on the back but im also the first one to give them a kick up the bum when they need it theyve reacted really well to me so far and hopefully that will continue
6991332 you dont expect it on your doorstep but thats life it could happen anywhere

6991335 djibril is a good player who is capable of doing something special
6991336 if he plays games then he will score goals because that is what he has always done i think cisses game is wellsuited to the premier league and he will make a big impact
6991337 we need someone up front and he would bring some power to our forward line i dont know him well but when we are in the international team we have spoken and he is a good man diouf knows him more than me and they will be a very good combination as well im sure
6991338 i already feel at home at sunderland because this manager is building a team and it is exciting to be part of it i think sunderland can do something big this season
6991339 it did not surprise me to see us signing a player like cisse sunderland are a big team and we have big hopes for this new season signing cisse proves what we are trying to do here i think people are taking notice of sunderland and for a big world star to join us is another big sign
6991340 going back to spurs is just a normal game for me it is like when i played liverpool last weekend there is no extra pressure i dont think i have anything to prove i have left but i dont need to prove anything to anyone it is normal for a player to leave a club
6991341 to play in front of 50 000 or so is what i came here for
6991342 we played well against liverpool and we were disappointed not to get anything from the game
6991343 the english population 60 million have won nine gold medals at these games australia with a third of the population has 11 golds thus far
6991344 the other seven claimed by the poms were in fact won under the nonsensical banner of great britain with the help of the scots and welsh and a cyclist who was born in belgium to an australian father whose genes were obviously passed on
6991345 we as an organising committee are very grateful for that platform because that allows us to drive the length and breadth of the united kingdom building on the excitement that has been generated over the last two and a half weeks here
6991346 whether it is bringing to the table more business partners or broadening the appeal to groups of people who may not have understood the full value of that until the performances that theyve witnessed domestically in the last few days
6991347 you talk about being olympic champion all the time and it doesnt seem real when it actually happens
6991348 when youre working through the winter falling to pieces in training and doubting yourself days like this seem a very very long way away but it just proves its always worth the effort
6991349 ive had my ups and downs in this sport but i never lost sight that i could do this i always believed i would be an olympic champion one day
6991350 i was good then but i wasnt anywhere near this good
6991351 i took 18 months off after athens but i knew id come back strong i got world silver in 2006 gold in 2007 and now olympic gold i just had to maintain the right progression and keep believing in myself
6991352 my mother died three years ago and she was a great supporter of me
6991353 she was at the last two olympics with my dad and it was a very emotional moment for us all to fulfill this dream
6991354 i expected gold but the way he raced it from the very first stroke was fantastic once he got past 600m i never had a moments doubt that hed win tim always goes out fast but he just flew out the blocks
6991355 weve got some talented youngsters coming through and this is only going to spur them on
6991356 its an impressive time and we were easing down as well
6991357 its a really quick track and were looking good it has to fill us with confidence
6991358 sub three minutes is usually a medal but the standard goes up in olympic year weve got to run like this again and finish the job
6991359 montell was a little off balance as she came in and maybe i just went too soon i dont know what to say
6991360 theres pressure on every club for a club like tottenham when you spend money pressure comes along but that comes with any job in the premier league
6991361 tottenham have only had one game they are all good players and it will be difficult down there it always is
6991362 the lads who have come in from tottenham have nothing to prove
6991363 there was a deal to be had their manager wanted to bring in his own players and thats the business side of it hopefully the players will go there and not get too bogged down by the fact they are at their old club
6991364 you have to constantly remind them of the players you are playing against and you have to have knowledge of who you are up against
6991365 you may not be aware of what you are missing when it comes to your gaming experience and community through the use of ventrilo servers you can increase your gaming communitys productivity and can help you to take the home gaming experience and turn it into a truly social environment
6991366 we have another chance to measure ourselves against one of the best teams in the league
6991367 we feel this is the most important game of the season for us
6991368 team gb have done fantastically well i have been watching the olympics all the time but football has always been my main goal
6991369 i did athletics to keep fit in the summer when the football season finished
6991370 my best time was 11 01 seconds at the english schools finals when i was 16 i am not sure what i would do now you dont really do 100m work in football but with training who knows
6991371 i should be under 11 seconds definitely and maybe somewhere close to ten seconds flat
6991372 i would love to play at liverpool but david wheater did fantastically well in that position last week so it is up to the manager said hoyte
6991373 i didnt play much last season so this was a great opportunity for regular first team football
6991374 there are similarities in the way they want their team to play quick passing entertaining football
6991375 arsenal are a young attacking team and i know middlesbrough like to play in the same way
6991376 i like to get forward a lot from right back but my main function is to defend and that is always my first duty
6991377 david bentley moved on from arsenal and played very well at blackburn which got him into the england team hopefully i can perform well for boro first and eventually get in the england side
6991378 stewie downing and david wheater have underlined you can do it while playing for middlesbrough
6991379 i spent a season at sunderland which was great so going up north wasnt a problem even though i am a london lad
6991380 when you are playing you can see how passionate the fans are
6991381 when i left sunderland i did a lap of honour and just didnt want to come off
6991382 we had ignored him kayizzi earlier but on the evidence of his performances we will have to consider him now he has looked impressive

6991401 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6991402 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at sen obamas campaign
6991403 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6991404 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6991405 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6991406 even if you have a 21st century classroom flexible and adaptable even if you are a 21st century teacher an adapter a communicator a leader and a learner a visionary and a model a collaborator and risk taker even if your curriculum reflects the new paradigm and you have the facilities and resources that could enable 21st century learning you will only be a 21st century teacher if how we teach changes as well our pedagogy must also change
6991407 how we teach must reflect how our students learn it must also reflect the world they will emerge into this is a world that is rapidly changing connected adapting and evolving our style and approach to teaching must emphasise the learning in the 21st century
6991408 obviously it wasnt very nice but i wasnt expecting cheers

6991448 opvallend is dat steeds meer jonge kinderen uit eenoudergezinnen komen
6991449 op 1 september zullen er dat vermoedelijk weer wat meer zijn
6991450 verschillende internaten zitten al vol op drie jaar tijd openen we maar liefst vijf nieuwe internaten een serieuze aanwijzing dus dat het goed gaat
6991451 in de regio gent zit werkelijk alles vol ik ken ouders die wanhopig op zoek zijn naar nog een plekje voor hun kind
6991452 het is het logische gevolg van de maatschappelijke evolutie dat steeds meer ouders scheiden wie alleenstaand is heeft het moeilijker om werk en zorg voor de kinderen te combineren denk maar aan een moeder die verpleegster of arbeidster is en tot 22 uur s avonds moet werken dan biedt het internaat vaak een goede oplossing
6991453 in de basisschool is het vaak de gezinssituatie die doorslaggevend is voor de inschrijving men is alleenstaande ouder en heeft het gevoel dat het kind om pedagogische redenen beter af is in een internaat men kan s avonds geen tijd vrij maken om zoon of dochter van school te halen of te begeleiden met huiswerk
6991454 ongeveer een kwart van de kinderen komt uit een eenoudergezin
6991455 alleenstaande moeders hebben het vaak niet zo gemakkelijk sommige jongens gedragen zich hier tijdens de week als lammetjes maar in het weekend bij hun mama durven ze heel moeilijk te doen we hebben een aantal moeders die dat nu rapporteren op mail zodat we hun zonen daarover op maandag kunnen aanspreken
6991456 you need to come down and meet me at mas house after work

6991459 but i am confident of long term gains that will help drive the online gaming market area forward
6991460 and i think as we look forward a lot will depend on the behavior of consumers if they choose to spend their money well get out of the slow times fast if however on the other hand they decided to save it or pay off debt were looking at a more bear market
6991461 its true were laying off workers because of the economy but the ones were laying off are employees that contribute little to our operations our best employees continue to hold their jobs and will continue with us as long as they maintain their excellent records further were going to reward our online gaming market analysts who are in high demand with a cost of living raise plus 2 of their salaries
6991462 the last thing i want to do is send people home because thats against our companys mission statement
6991463 and also because we can reallocate our human capital to work on other projects that will be beneficial while the consumer market slows down
6991464 i trust the word of naveja noga especially in these times
6991465 and will look to other analysts of the same ilk to gauge how we move forward in this environment

6991614 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6991615 we havent seen that yet its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6991616 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations

6991622 they have done a fantastic job here brilliant facilities and a great atmosphere and i have learned a huge amount but i am more confident than ever about what we can do in greenwich
6991623 i am hugely excited to have got the job my first priority will be to work with the venue design team as our sport is unique in having four legged athletes as well as two legged ones training on site some venues will just be used for two or three days with athletes training elsewhere but at greenwich the venue is the sport and the sport is the venue
6991624 sue benson was here and is pleased that in greenwich her course will be able to be more open less twisty and longer a 10 or 11 minute course rather than the 8 minute one that for obvious reasons they had here
6991625 i am very confident about the site at greenwich i can understand that some people are concerned because decisions have not yet been made so they havent been communicated we need to get down to details so that people can be informed and i would expect that to be done by next spring
6991626 no decisions on the final number of spectators have been made yet
6991627 we evalueren altijd wat er gebeurt op de markt en iets dat zeker is gebeurd de afgelopen maanden is dat sony een aantal dozen heeft verkocht
6991628 of je nu wel of niet graag wil ontwikkelen voor dat platform als er miljoenen mensen aangesloten zijn daarop en hun games kopen dan moeten we dat serieus nemen ze zitten nu in de race en we moeten dat herevalueren
6991629 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
6991630 there is a bond in place we think it is very appropriate
6991631 builders dont charge to build these houses every nail stick of wood and piece of furniture is donated
6991632 i just need people who are willing to give a few hours out of their lives to make a difference for a family
6991633 the families do not know until the moment that we drive up in that bus with ty and the designers and shout out their names

6991635 people need to realize that vaccines are safe and effective and they protect against many potentially deadly diseases
6991636 so she can be well so she wont get sick

6991638 we discuss the safety of the vaccines and try to meet the parents concerns
6991639 we are a lot cleaner society now than when we struggled with polio and such
6991640 when you google something on the web on immunizations youre going to get a mixed bag of information back to you some thats positive some thats negative
6991641 i think the important thing is that people talk to their primary care provider about immunizations
6991642 some people wonder why we give vaccines for diseases that are rarely seen anymore
6991643 the reason we hardly ever see these diseases anymore is because children are widely vaccinated now
6991644 though not common in michigan these diseases are only a plane ride away
6991645 these diseases still exist in the world and children can come into contact with them

6991671 this is a time when we had to do what we could
6991672 its not our fault we couldnt get it done in halifax
6991673 we have basically spoken to everyone we feel that we could speak to at this time
6991674 weve found independent witnesses that dont support the allegations of any racial comments that were made
6991675 were not saying it didnt happen were just saying that what were getting from independent witnesses is not what was said
6991676 if the crown wants to release it it will be up to them
6991677 when it comes to any kind of disturbance we have to deal with the person we feel is the most hostile and the most volatile
6991678 walking down the street or being black which is it
6991679 they told him not to appear in court on the 18th and thats the last i heard
6991680 if this is the result then this is just another one of the police coverups
6991681 somebody directs a racial slur at you that you answer to how is that causing a disturbance
6991682 i havent seen the video and as far as i know my son has not seen the video
6991683 i havent talked to the mounties about returning our video
6991684 i cant speak for the whole town council but im sure theyd feel the same
6991685 we have our troubles were like every other little town but its almost like were being classed as a racist town because of the actions of people from outside
6991686 if hes in default under the code of conduct that can range anywhere from a reprimand to dismissal
6991687 if hes found guilty of that it would be unlikely that it would result in termination and thats why hes placed on administrative duties and not suspension

6991700 the amount of concern and urgency from the detroit companies has increased in the last month and significantly ratcheted up what theyre communicating what their funding needs are
6991701 i believe we should fund it and take action that will assist detroit and its suppliers in making it through this difficult time of transition
6991702 its a common sense response to the realities on the ground
6991703 we dont see it as a bailout we see it as government assistance to help retooling tied to the production of these advanced technology vehicles
6991704 government policy can be aligned with consumer demand and the efforts of the industry
6991705 each year we see more evidence that our nations obesity epidemic continues to gain speed and destructive force
6991706 hes edged himself out because he can run the football
6991707 its still a good situation nothing crazy has happened we just think brad was just a little further along
6991708 they mcguire and masson both did really good things and have come a long way since the spring it was a hard decision since we were forced to make a decision we leaned toward brad right now
6991709 he showed some leadership qualities and he organized the offense well
6991710 hes not quite the runner that mike desormeaux is but i dont know who is in the country i think brad has one of the stronger arms of the guys we have he has a good understanding our schemes and where the ball should be going
6991711 hes run the ball well and caught onto the offense well
6991712 i want to build a rapport with the kids and get to the point where they get past the uniform and can come to me if something is happening in their home life or at school
6991713 are we developing a system here to where in the future well end up with 30 or 40 police officers covering all our schools what are you doing to our children
6991714 they have a shorter fuse at the beginning of school
6991715 i think coach wants somebody to emerge as the one guy but even if one of us does coach is not going to completely turn his shoulder to what keiland and richard bring to the table
6991716 even if one guy steps up and becomes that guy like jacob youll still see the others a lot
6991717 charles scott is a big pounder hes going to bruise your defense up hes about 235 pounds and hes going to run forward and through you keiland williams is more of a finesse guy hes going to dance around the field and make plays richard murphy that guys a speedster he reminds a lot of people of reggie bush and hes going to make plays all over the field
6991718 if they put me in there im going to show them what i can do
6991719 but it will be interesting i think charles scott may have a great year maybe richard murphy and keiland williams is unmentioned but certainly very talented
6991720 keiland has a tremendous upside and hopefully it will be brought out this year or in more plays this year youll see it
6991721 i think there is a lot of competition going on out there and i think its a position that will bring out the best in that group certainly keiland has as much talent or more as any
6991722 i have to do a better job of holding onto the football i know that but i dont get treated any differently i just have to do a better job of taking advantage of my opportunities with coach miles you always get your opportunities and that will happen for me this season there are just a lot of other good backs here at lsu
6991723 it is also to demand our right to self determination through a referendum
6991724 the fighting that is still raging has so far left five militants and three soldiers dead including a colonel
6991725 this program proves that the most effective way is the way we have been doing it through fugitive operations
6991726 they knew this project was going to be a failure they needed an excuse to justify what they have been doing
6991727 we are telling people not to answer their doors if ice officers arrive looking for fugitives
6991728 many of these immigrants have lived in this country for years
6991729 it takes more than 90 days to sell their house close their bank accounts take care of their finances and take their children out of school
6991730 the common refrain were hearing is when can i get one of these
6991731 that tells us the public is really interested in energy independence
6991732 this incredible vehicle has zero emissions and a top speed of 93 miles per hour
6991733 if they would get the hydrogen through renewable means i would walk away from my internal combustion vehicle and step into a fuel cell vehicle
6991734 the whole oil thing has been a joke for years
6991735 if people drove cars like this instead of what we have it would do a lot for the environment and help create jobs
6991736 this temporary suspension ensures that the status quo is maintained while the litigation is in process
6991737 candidates in good faith decided to enter into the system
6991738 and it would cause complete havoc to change the rules at this stage in the game
6991739 the challengers get matched when i spend something or if somebody spends on my behalf i dont get matched if somebody spends on their behalf its a real fairness issue
6991740 no decisions were made and aviation continues to work with the companies
6991741 as long as i committed a crime in their presence their trust in me went up
6991742 the fatal shooting that happened before the guy didnt seem all that injured
6991743 our last day to get all this done is the 28th
6991744 ive got to know what to put on the ballot
6991745 this is a stellar year in terms of the magnitude of the issues we have to deal with
6991746 no vote shall have the effect of retaining the current laws regarding marriage
6991747 a statute that prohibits marriage between persons of the same sex
6991748 we encourage people to get involved and express their disapproval of these systems
6991749 i just want people to pay more attention to whats going on instead of getting a ticket and not fighting it
6991750 these cameras are proven to reduce violations crashes and injuries and they are overwhelmingly popular in arizona and across the country
6991751 i find it troubling that two months into the fiscal year you come back and want to renege on those agreements and roll them back
6991752 what kind of message does that send to the other officials that have worked in good faith and in the taxpayers interest to do more with less to weather the tough economic storm that were in
6991753 this idea is so good so amazing i wont forget it
6991754 this is a family fraud case and perhaps they were under the misguided impression because they serve a small and remote community they would escape detection by the law
6991755 however no matter how small we pay attention to all areas of the county to root out crime
6991756 a lot of the motivation revolved around what is important to teenagers
6991757 we wanted to create an environment from out of their culture and whats important to them
6991758 i knew i wanted to surround myself with women who were a part of my club a club you dont seek membership in
6991759 laura everyone knows youre a singer do what you do best
6991760 we leave our cancer at the door with this group
6991761 were all here because of the cancer but we leave it at the door
6991762 i remember having my mastectomy crying my eyes out and they nurses held your hand
6991763 i remember thinking to myself how do you say thank you to a nurse they play such a role in our recovery
6991764 i remember tears streaming down my face i loved it i felt connected to marilyn she knew my story and we hadnt even talked about it
6991765 when youre first told you have breast cancer you cant explain what you feel
6991766 its almost as if its an out of body experience when she was writing the song i saw that it gave us a feeling of unity
6991767 if we give them the confidence to smile again and sing then weve done our job
6991768 as i have said sellers attract buyers by preparing home
6991769 with three body styles striking exterior and interior design improvements barina will appeal to a broad range of customer groups add side impact airbags and the package becomes even more attractive
6991770 barina represents great value for money in a growing segment of the market that appreciates fuel economy and the convenience of a small vehicle
6991771 the zombie marriage is just a phase and quite possibly a crucial one for a lifelong relationship to survive its most challenging period it must enter an unconscious protective state so that no matter how many stakes are driven through its heart it will continue to stumble forward because the zombie marriage just like those b movie ghouls who can be restored to mortality with a few drops of a serum or potion can be revived
6991772 back home i was a hod carrier rushing up and down a 35 rung ladder with a pile of bricks on each shoulder
6991773 that was my routine eight hours every day and then id go training down the gym after that
6991774 he was a little tubby kid when i first knew him a light heavyweight which shows how much hes worked
6991775 there was something about him and ive always felt that if he had a reasonable draw hed have a great chance
6991776 ive always said that if my head was right my weights okay and my trainings gone well then i am the man
6991777 its gonna be big something so big we cant even tell you what it is
6991778 hartkloppingen zijn de manier waarop je lichaam je duidelijk maakt dat je het naar je zin hebt
6991779 ik zal eens laten zien hoe we dit soort varkentjes in zeeland wassen
6991780 lang leve habakuk de enige studentenvereniging die er toe doet
6991781 it was difficult in my lane and you can see how strong competitive the kayaking is at the moment with the finish being so close
6991782 everyone is different approach otherwise it would be a boring world
6991783 oh wow that thing is awesome what do you mean its a cake
6991784 i dont care what she says you were there when i told her what i was doing it was weeds anyway

6991787 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
6991788 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
6991789 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgement and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6991790 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
6991791 seriousness of the conflicting claims which are crucial in pinpointing responsibility
6991792 the detachment will be established in the midst of a thickly populated area of the barangay village thereby posing danger to the residents in case of an attack
6991793 to coordinate with the ship owner the international maritime authorities and the host governments on efforts to secure the safe and speedy release of the crewmembers
6991794 one of the better games weve played in the past three or four weeks
6991795 weve been struggling everybody knows it but were pulling together
6991796 he pitches quite a few games like that where we dont score a whole lot of runs seems like theyre always close games
6991797 im glad i made contact to get a hit is even better
6991798 the umpires got together to try to get it right thats all you can ask for if this thing replay comes along hopefully it can help out
6991799 i was just trying to get the bat on the ball
6991800 fortunately i got some good wood on it and it went out
6991801 i have no excuses for it just bad execution of pitches and leaving pitches that are way too good in the zone obviously a team like that can swing it a little bit
6991802 then i think my age caught up with me and i got a little tired in the last inning it just seemed like a lot culminated in that one inning
6991803 to walk the leadoff hitter then get out of it with a groundball when i needed to was huge
6991804 the runner on third did not leave early he left perfectly
6991805 you dont see that a lot in our league it didnt catch us off guard it was just well done
6991806 is facing so many left handed pitchers here lately were trying to get him going hes battling hes giving us good at bats he takes a couple steps forward and occasionally a step back he took a big step forward tonight with a couple big hits against left handers
6991807 j j is slowly getting back to his former self
6991808 you can long toss all you want to build arm strength but 4 oclock long toss is completely different than 10 oclock long toss in the ninth inning
6991809 it comes with consistent work in games im supposed to be in its just been a rough year for everybody
6991810 theres a long ways to go here its fun to be bouncing back and forth i mean it would be nicer to get up there where the angels are and get a big lead but all we can do is control our games and go out and play them and do the best we can
6991811 hopefully well stay in this thing the whole way thats what we plan on doing and well go from there
6991812 everybodys been talking about this road trip and how we dont play as well on the road as we do at home
6991813 so to get off to a good start on this trip is definitely going to help us going forward into the next couple of series
6991814 he used his changeup well pitched on the inner half of the plate very well and gave our guys a chance to get going offensively
6991815 span and delmon had a heck of a night driving the ball for us
6991816 delmon got a pitch out and over the plate and he crushed that ball weve seen this guy do this a few times this year he can flip a ball up in the stands with the best of them
6991817 he pitched a good game but its more than just perkins
6991818 this is not anything thats going to take a major overhaul we just need a few tweaks here and there some guys are gripping the bat too tight squeezing sawdust out of it we just have to refocus and get back to playing the game
6991819 ive never had that many strikeouts in any season its cool everything was going well everything felt good
6991820 at this stage of the season to have 200 strikeouts that tells you what incredible stuff he has whats been impressive is how hes emerged as a pitcher too he can throw any pitch any time
6991821 he just doesnt miss very often over the plate and when he does its going 95 mph
6991822 its different to have success against him you basically have to wait for him to make a mistake
6991823 baek pitched a solid game but they didnt miss a mistake in the fourth inning
6991824 bengie hit it well and the home run was the death blow
6991825 i would have been ok with going out there but there are other guys for that situation
6991826 they dont need to throw me out there if they dont want to id love to get a complete game in there but if i dont im still just trying to do my job and give them what i can while im out there
6991827 its not very nice for children breathing in the smoke and watching adults smoking
6991828 we are in the process of preparing notices to be displayed around the childrens play area in ynysangharad war memorial park
6991829 these notices will request that park users refrain from smoking in that area
6991830 im not saying you shouldnt smoke within the park itself
6991831 what will you do if we dont recognize you again as one of our preachers
6991832 why that wont stop me ill go to the nursing home and preach ill go to the street corner and preach
6991833 youre just lying they havent moved that street corner or that nursing home have they it was there all year long but you didnt go why should you go this year
6991834 if you dont know who to block on a play just knock the daylights out of someone
6991835 whatever your hand finds to do do it with all your might
6991836 whatever turns up grab it and do it and heartily
6991837 ive got no control over this disease and im b terrified
6991838 i am going to fight the damn thing every step of the way because i have two beautiful boys who are my world
6991839 but i have to be realistic and face the possibility that i might not live to see them grow up
6991840 then it hit me that some women get cancer and never become mums
6991841 i realised i should be thankful for my gorgeous sons and decided i was going to take this horrible disease on and win
6991842 we found out that wall street has been kind of a nudist beach
6991843 theyre looking for help obviously and the scale of help is such that i dont think it can come from the private sector
6991844 a problem with a temperature sensor may not matter at all or it can be very important depending on what other circumstances accompany it
6991845 we will have to see what other issues were present
6991846 clearly the breakdown was important enough for the pilot to halt the manoeuvre and have it reviewed
6991847 i consider fear and loathing in las vegas to be comfort reading i like the al pastor tacos at tacos mexico and i count among my literary influences the chainsaw from doom
6991848 barack has chosen joe biden to be his running mate
6991849 joe biden brings extensive foreign policy experience an impressive record of collaborating across party lines and a direct approach to getting the job done
6991850 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
6991851 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realising that barack obama is not ready to be president
6991852 all our guys know the gameplan and exactly where we want to play from
6991853 but we have now also placed more emphasis on the specific roles of each player
6991854 dating as it is is a delicate issue which needs to be handled with care it becomes even more complicated when there are children involved many people think twice about dating someone who has children and many singles with children are slightly nervous in starting a new relationship dating a person with children could end in a very long lasting relationship however you have to tread very cautiously taking care in every step so that the children are not hurt surely the presence of children do complicate matters but it does not mean that the relationship is doomed
6991855 is this a stone is it another obstruction or is this just normal pain or even normal crohns pain

6991869 er ist sauer ich kanns ihm nicht bel nehmen ich w rs auch ich f hle mich so schuldig ihm das anzutun aber ich kann nichts f r meine gef hle ich bin einfach unsicher
6991870 wahrscheinlich werden sie sagen es gibt nur 90 tage garantie diese s cke

6991872 ich meine ich wei dass es nie einen ritter geben wird es ist so dumm weder einen ritter noch ein pferd
6991873 die sache ist die es ist einfach so ich brauche ein wenig zeit

6991897 he really understands our kind of personalities as players and capitalizes on them
6991898 it makes it a lot easier we want to learn
6991899 hes more involved in the practices if one of us doesnt understand one of the coverages hell hop out there and show us exactly what he wants to see
6991900 it makes it easier for us to understand exactly what he wants to see instead of just telling it to us
6991901 i think pauls been refined by fire both personally and then as a coach
6991902 they were able to talk to each other and hold each others hands

6991904 we extend our thanks for prayers and support being sent our way god is good and we have our boys back
6991905 they were in there looking around and all of a sudden boom
6991906 and i heard one of the eastside fire amp rescue guys had brought up a chain saw and we tried that
6991907 two rocks fell on each side of the boys and that kind of supported the weight around them
6991908 she is good dont worry shes not in serious condition
6991909 i dont care what people say about that kind of stuff
6991910 its kind of hard to restrict them from all the things they hear and read and what people are saying around them

6991922 veterans like melissa they really feel theyre proud of their service

6991926 we believe in each other that its a little stretch were going through so we just gotta get through it start playing better

6991933 actually for him that year it should have been a quadruple crown
6991934 but the goal is to be up there at the end of the year
6991935 there is some merit to be near the top because that can help you when it comes to the playoffs
6991936 we discovered how good of a team we were last year and our confidence levels are up there we plan on winning the big sky conference we talk about that every day
6991937 adam is a truly excellent tutor his eager and charismatic personality always kept me engaged even if the material was boring or difficult he made sure i knew how to do a problem in multiple ways including how to check my work on a calculator which proved to be incredibly useful during the final 6 weeks of school my grade raised from a c to an a in calculus which would have never been possible without his help adam is easily the best tutor i have ever had and because of him i actually started enjoying math class
6991938 i hired adam to perform a nearly impossible task to teach math to my son then in college who had not completed a math class since the seventh grade due to severe illness starting in august adam had to bring my son to a point where he could test into his grade level then a sophomore in college which would allow him to take and succeed in the required math classes to qualify for transfer to a major four year university in california all in 6 months my son did test well enough to take both pre calculus and statistics in the spring semester and i am proud to say that with adams continued help he earned a b and an a in those classes i cannot recommend adam highly enough
6991939 adam is a phenomenal tutor he is one of the few people who has the natural gift of teaching he is intelligent clear and engaging he not only inspires me to learn but he makes each session enjoyable and exciting if asked i would strongly suggest that he pursue a career in education but what is most impressive is that adam took me from a person who had not opened a math book in almost eight years to someone who was so successful on the placement exam that i have placed into the highest math level offered i have not only reached my goals i have surpassed them and this is all thanks to adam

6991944 i thought that the way he ran a year ago was extremely impressive i thought maybe he should have gotten some consideration even last year
6991945 its an honor and a blessing to even be mentioned in the same sentence with the heisman trophy
6991946 for guys like archie to say something like that thats incredible

6992128 verschiebung von karten f r die neue allianz anw rter fuhr er fort w rden belaufen sich auf beschwichtigung als ein
6992129 die abschreckung und appeasement argumente waren nat rlich gut getestet rhetorische werkzeuge rumsfeld und andere erfolgreich angewendet hatte bevor zu mobilisierende amerikanische unterst tzung gegen die sowjetunion ebenso wie jugoslawien und irak
6992130 der vereinigten staaten sollte auch weiterhin darauf dr ngen die nato erweiterung ohne bef rchten zu beleidigen russland
6992131 unterst tzung der bev lkerung f r die universellen werte der demokratie individuelle freiheit und b rgerrechte
6992132 zeugenaussagen die ihren fall zu ignorieren russland vorgebrachten bedenken hinsichtlich der nato erweiterung
6992133 werde damit europa den vereinigten staaten und der nato zur erweiterung der zone der freiheit und der sicherheit
6992134 der gesetzentwurf vorgesehenen 10 millionen an hilfsgeldern im gesch ftsjahr 2008 von georgien f r die mitgliedschaft vorbereitungen am 6 m rz ein hnliches gesetz wurde vom repr sentantenhaus
6992135 recently suggested it might turn its nuclear arsenal on ukraine or incite civil disorder in georgia
6992136 green light to russia to continue the tired rhetoric of the cold war
6992137 moscows ambition to destroy those countries ukraine and georgias freedom and independence
6992138 popular support for the universal values of democracy individual liberty and civil rights
6992139 will enable europe the united states and nato to expand the zone of freedom and security
6992140 die weltmacht amerika dem l und gasriesen russland noch immer milit risch und wirtschaftlich haushoch berlegen erlebt derzeit ein albtraum szenario
6992141 pl tzlich diktiert nicht washington sondern moskau das geschehen auf der weltpolitischen b hne s dossetien m chte unabh ngig von georgien werden bitte sch n sagen die russen autonomie war f r uns doch schon immer ein h chstwichtiges weil basisdemokratisches gut
6992142 was muss ich alles daher quatschen damit ich zum schotter komme und meinen job mache
6992143 au er verbalem s belrasseln einem eingefrorenen nato russland rat und der aufk ndigung einiger gemeinsamer man ver haben die vereinigten staaten an drohpotential gegen moskau nichts zu bieten auch der hastig unterzeichnete us raketenpakt mit warschau ist nicht viel mehr als eine geste amerikanischer verzweiflung nach dem motto wir geben euch nicht auf riskieren aber im ernstfall keinen milit rischen konflikt mit moskau
6992144 demokraten und republikanern ist es gleicherma en ein grauen dass ab sofort herr putin und seine marionetten bestimmen k nnten wer in zukunft mitglied der nato oder der europ ischen union wird zum beispiel im fall der ukraine es ist nur noch eine frage der zeit bis russland den krimstaat am strategisch wichtigen schwarzen meer in hnlicher weise zu kolonialisieren versucht wie georgien
6992145 doch selbst hardliner john mccain der russland am liebsten noch an diesem wochenende aus dem wichtigen kreis der m chtigen g8 staaten ausschlie en w rde muss erkennen amerika ist von russland viel abh ngiger als moskau von washington denn ohne russlands hilfe sind amerikas brandherde nicht zu l schen zum beispiel in iran bereits jetzt r stet moskau die mullahs in teheran massiv mit raketenabwehrsystemen auf eine f r amerika und seinen engsten verb ndeten israel brandgef hrliche situation
6992146 wir tuns wir tuns jaaaaa wir tuns echt nein doch wirklich sehet her sehet her sehet heeer
6992147 gleichzeitig kann die un vetomacht russland jederzeit alle versuche aushebeln den iran konflikt diplomatisch zu l sen auch in afghanistan kann russland die amerikaner noch st rker in die defensive zwingen als sie es ohnehin schon sind etwas druck auf kirgistan reicht aus und schon verlieren die usa eine ihrer wichtigsten operationsbasen gegen die taliban in afghanistan iran afghanistan nordkorea russland kann alle diese krisen sch ren und gef hrliche stellvertreterkriege f hren
6992148 der schaden w re f r washington deutlich gr er als f r moskau syriens pr sident baschar al assad hat die gunst der stunde f r alle amerikagegner bereits begriffen und in dieser woche schon einmal in russland neue waffensysteme geordert der kalte krieg kehrt in raten zur ck den usa bleibt nur eine hoffnung dass russlands milliardenschwere oligarchen um ministerpr sident putin kein interesse an einem dauer konflikt mit den usa haben weil sie lieber dollar scheffeln als ihren reichtum in einem neuen kalten krieg zu verlieren
6992149 barack l a ales pe senatorul joe biden pentru functia de vicepresedinte
6992150 they like him they want to give him a chance but its a big big job they need some reassurances that hes up to it
6992151 hes not one whos going to shoot from the hip
6992152 i think the personal character is more important than the experience
6992153 its a very complicated job with a lot of pieces that are constantly moving on you
6992154 if the campaign is disorganized and the candidate is disorganized that might be an indication they cant put a white house together
6992155 his experience is certainly not something you would look at and say this is who i want to be leader of the free world
6992156 ollie also worked on all my regular shows at the grey lady music lounge and he performed
6992157 its a non profit community event and is about creating awareness of local original music
6992158 its all down to local businesses chipping in to give their support
6992159 people were sending in cds and we had to go to two shows a week since april last year
6992160 now there are more than 100 acts on our list the idea is for acts to build up a profile and come back on rotation the ethos of the show is to give local acts the chance to perform in a real listening environment turn mobile phones off just listen
6992161 theres a distinct lack of venues that will put on original music especially acoustic music you need that listening environment so it does not become background music
6992162 why tax the rich more than the poor are we being punished for being successful
6992163 just get an electric guitar then take some time and learn how to play
6992164 so you want to be a rock n roll star
6992165 man i am really making some money with this program
6992166 it is definitely a good feeling to finally record that first win of the season people can say stevenage have had a bad start to the season but it is too early to start reading into things we have just got to be focused on our job on saturday and make sure we get the three points
6992167 i think jamie will be a good addition to our squad he will bring a lot of experience to the midfield but as for that being my final signing we will have to wait and see
6992168 i was kind of doing an interview on the sideline with somebody some tv network and they were chanting negatively over there
6992169 they love me they miss me but im not with them so they hate me
6992170 you think theyll let me go to the new england side and get something to eat im starving
6992171 everybody knows the situation was about the patriots and how they do business
6992172 its not nothing to talk about im not a guy thats going to keep controversy going life goes on
6992173 ive been here two games and it hasnt been real good
6992174 ive been on teams that are 0 4 in the preseason and start off 5 0 and conversely ive been 4 0 in the preseason and you dont start off very well
6992175 i dont think the results are important but how were playing thats more important
6992176 its early theres a lot of work to do and were prepared to do it
6992177 we cant be up and down with the media and the fans because thats what it is its a roller coaster
6992178 you cant allow your emotions to set in especially so early in the season where the season hasnt even begun im not necessarily saying we dont have problems that we need to correct but its having the sense and poise to say these problems can be corrected and its not to late
6992179 right now as far as were concerned were 0 3 in the preseason but were still 0 0
6992180 there are a lot of things where there are injuries to other positions
6992181 ill take the responsibility for that but regardless you still have to cover

6992218 dave is more of the hardcore trained artist and my background is much more in music and in computers and animation
6992219 i write a lot of the software that we use to drive all of this partially because you cant just buy off the shelf software that you plug music into and animation comes up its not the way stuff is usually done
6992220 we can start an animation from any number of angles
6992221 you could start literally writing all the music first and then deciding what the instruments look like weve done that before we could actually design a whole instrument without figuring out any music for it to play until its done and weve done that as well or the ideal way to do it is where youre co developing the music and the instruments together

6992352 while gradients and various hues and tones look cool on screen they dont reproduce well on a mug letterhead or stationary
6992353 i find that the customer can get more value for their money with linux
6992354 since linux provides many possible platforms customizations database options and programming language compatibilities
6992355 i like to keep all pages to w3c html standards so that crawling by robots and human use is as errorless as possible
6992356 they are by far more skilled and less expensive than hiring a specialty in house staff for a online gaming for the greater society project as a result we just need a couple in house designers to help maintain the website after it is built and take care of odd jobs
6992357 i triple check and test all our online gaming for the greater society website code many times before we launch a beta version for the marketing team to check the more people that test the website before the publish date the better since this is a great way to find any bugs that might throw a wrench in the works
6992358 also dont rule out the importance of your database language
6992359 we find that mysql works best in most all cases and provides the flexibility and reliability that we need for our intensive website creations
6992360 although php is the most popular among web application developers some online gaming for the greater society websites use asp

6992365 students and parents must understand that attending school is not optional
6992366 when they fail to attend school they are breaking the law
6992367 were all for keeping kids in school and we applaud any efforts to make that happen
6992368 but the privacy issue what happens with the bracelet or anklet after school is out is that appropriate for the school or courts to know where and what this person is doing outside of school
6992369 sometimes as i said students are runaways parents dont know where they are
6992370 so its for the safety of the child as well as the safety of the community

6992386 there were no significant studies examining the long term health of people in communities with naturally fluoridated water however exposure via drinking water at levels not much higher than what was proposed for fluoridation had been associated in numerous published studies beginning around 1940 with serious adverse skeletal and neuromuscular effects in india and other countries opposition to fluoridation initially came from scientists concerned about the lack of good evidence on possible health risks
6992387 those who did openly oppose fluoridation were often subject of personal attack and professional reprisals for decades mainstream scientific journals would reject for publication any paper that did not articulate a strictly pro fluoridation position on risk and benefit questions
6992388 i myself had three manuscripts based on my doctoral dissertation rejected by u s public health journals in the 1970s
6992389 my reviews of the evidence on risks and benefits of fluoridation were sent to anonymous pro fluoridation referees who found them

6992393 die waren niet allemaal even eenvoudig te beantwoorden en de vragen gaven ons ook hints over hoe we de aanbesteding nog beter konden formuleren
6992394 maar het nadeel is dat we nu weten hoeveel haken en ogen er kleven aan zon procedure we vroegen ons van tevoren al af of het haalbaar was om de boeken aan te besteden daar zijn we niet echt optimistischer over geworden
6992395 dat heb je altijd als je de eerste bent die iets doet

6992430 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
6992431 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
6992432 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

6992513 anderen doet het misschien niets maar ik vind het leuke dagen
6992514 jammer genoeg is zij overleden nu ga ik met een kennis dat vind ik prettiger dan alleen mijn dochter wil wel mee maar dat is moeilijk in verband met de kinderen ook tijdens de reis leer je mensen kennen het zijn altijd gezellige groepen
6992515 samen met mijn dove zoon dat vond ik geweldig maar het is wel druk
6992516 jaren geleden werd mij gevraagd om dit te doen zelf heb ik nooit bijgehouden wanneer ik ben begonnen tijdens de laatste vergadering onlangs in heiloo vertelde het bestuur dat het mijn 25 jarig jubileum is ik schrok ervan dat mijn naam werd genoemd met bloemen en een mooie maria kaars werd ik gehuldigd de kaars laat ik voordat ik hem aansteek eerst een tijd in de kast pronken
6992517 we vertrekken altijd s morgens vanaf een opstapplaats in de buurt onderweg naar belgi doen we nog wat stopplaatsen aan de dagen dat we in het plaatsje zijn bidden we overdag de rozenkrans en bezoeken we kerkdiensten tussendoor gebruiken we gezamenlijk maaltijden en s avonds ben je vrij om te doen wat je zelf wilt zelf ga ik in juni mee ik heb er echt veel zin in
6992518 ik ben niet tegen popularisering van wetenschappelijke werken het vertalen van strakke gegevens is een kunst zelf kan ik alleen niet goed genoeg op kinderniveau schrijven ik zocht iemand die dat wel kon bij mijn bezoek aan de archiefdienst kwam ik een paar jaar geleden via via in contact met marian en zo is het balletje gaan rollen
6992519 tot die tijd had ik alleen voor volwassenen geschreven mijn gedachten veranderden toen fred mij een keer meenam naar museum kennemerland ik kreeg meteen inspiratie hij vertelde daar verhalen over pakhuizen schepen en een markt ik kreeg er beelden bij van een rondlopend meisje met een broer en een zus hoewel ik een allrounder in het archief ben met een speciale belangstelling voor de middeleeuwen wist ik niet veel van beverwijk mijn voorwaarde om de samenwerking aan te gaan was dan ook dat fred het onderzoek zou doen
6992520 zelf kom ik uit het utrechtse montfoort op mijn 21 ste ben ik ingetreden in het klooster voor ik bij heliomare terecht kwam was ik in lisse en zwolle werkzaam geweest in het centrum was ik hoofd restauratieve voorzieningen er waren ongeveer zeven dames in dienst en daar had ik de supervisie over in die tijd was het hoofdzakelijk een personeelsrestaurant
6992521 het was een experiment om leef en werkmilieu te scheiden onze ordeleden woonden in drie verbouwde huizen naast elkaar we hadden leuke buren en werden gevraagd om te babysitten later zijn we verhuisd naar de laan van blois ik ging altijd op de brommer naar heliomare s morgens vroeg vertrok ik al en in de kapel deed ik mijn gebed en meditatie in het begin zat ik met mn sluier op de brommer
6992522 op de brommer moest ik wel wennen aan de autos ik had jaren niet meer aan het verkeer deelgenomen maar het is een prettig vervoersmiddel bij slecht weer werd ik thuis gebracht
6992523 toen ik er werkte was het centrum niet zo groot de sfeer was heel gemoedelijk achteraf gezien en ik kende ieder personeelslid
6992524 nee ik hield helemaal niet van al dat zand ik zong graag in het koor st odulphus en ben daarvan ook voorzitter geweest
6992525 ik vond het jammer om weg te gaan maar aan alles komt een eind bij mijn afscheid ontving ik uit handen van de burgemeester de legplakette van beverwijk als dank aan alle zusters die er werkzaam zijn geweest
6992526 ik doe dit met liefde wat betreft mijn gezondheid mag ik niet mopperen ik kan het werk nog doen verder ben ik altijd een huiselijk type geweest ik houd van lezen en puzzelen op mn kamer met heliomare ben ik contact blijven houden ik heb veel herinneringen aan mijn tijd daar
6992527 andere bibliotheken gebruiken bijvoorbeeld een strandhuisje of een portocabin maar ik vond een bouwkeet leuk
6992528 daar ben ik niet heel goed in wel haal ik eens per week als een soort van boodschappendame spullen
6992529 in de wagen zijn vooral makkelijk leesbare boeken zoals romans en tijdschriften te leen we hebben 1000 banden gehuurd er wordt gewerkt met een registratiekaart de doelstellingen van dit project zijn het lezen onder de jeugd te bevorderen en de kuststrook aantrekkelijker te maken daarnaast willen we samenwerking zoeken met bijvoorbeeld non profit milieueducatieve organisaties met deze flexibele bibliotheek kun je bovendien na afloop van het zomerproject scholen en evenementen in de regio bezoeken
6992530 de wagen is super mooi maar persoonlijk vind ik hoe meer tierlantijntjes hoe beter
6992531 het is zonde om de prachtige geloofsgemeenschap en kerk op te heffen
6992532 het was een geweldig mooie drukbezochte viering zelf wilde ik het vanwege de verwikkelingen sober houden daarom had ik het jubileum uit mn gedachten geschrapt ik stond dan ook perplex
6992533 ik heb dit altijd gewild vanaf het moment dat ik misdienaar was eerst was het een kinderlijke wens en later wordt het echt een bewuste keuze
6992534 ik nam alleen een paar weken vakantie per jaar op
6992535 de betrokkenheid is anders dan vroeger de vorm van kerk zijn met elkaar is in plaats van opgelegd losser geworden in de goede zin van het woord elke zondag verplicht naar de kerk gaan de eerste communie en biechten hoeft niet meer het heilige moeten is er af mensen bekijken zelf wat ze doen wie liever gaat vissen doet dat vroeger moest een kind vanwege de erfzonde snel worden gedoopt nu neemt men de tijd ervoor en is het een happening en wanneer er geestelijke begeleiding nodig is vraagt iemand zelf om een gesprek
6992536 de plaats van een priester zoals ik het heb gezien is niet van boven af maar samen met de mensen en het parochiebestuur deze parochie heeft 150 toegewijde medewerkers de mensen trekken al jaren met elkaar op het klikt gewoon tussen mij en het gros van de geloofsgemeenschap als priester krijg je een band met een heleboel families kinderen die hier misdienaar waren kom je later als volwassenen weer tegen
6992537 dat de overkoepelende parochie sint eloy de schitterend gedecoreerde kerk uit financieel oogpunt beoogt te sluiten kan de pastor moeilijk accepteren
6992538 bij de samenvoeging in de jaren negentig is gesuggereerd dat de vijf wijkparochies van sint eloy elkaar zouden helpen
6992539 we waren zelfs bezig om het honderdjarige bestaan van de kerk te plannen ik voel me gelukkig hier het maakt bij mij persoonlijk veel los als de parochie uit elkaar wordt gerukt
6992540 we moesten verschillende keren van repetitieruimte wisselen in die tijd hadden we geen piano maar een orgel koorleden moesten met de hand de blaasbalg aanpompen onze toenmalige dirigent was gerard de barbanson hij is acht jaar gebleven
6992541 in het begin waren er hooguit veertig leden we traden kleinschalig op in bejaardenhuizen na het vertrek van onze eerste dirigent kwam frans kocx uit beverwijk hij werd door de pastor aanbevolen als een veelbelovende dirigent
6992542 qua akoestiek is de kerk uit de kunst het vaandel van het r k gemengd koor heemskerk is hier bovendien bewaard gebleven
6992543 onze muziek spreekt blijkbaar jongeren niet echt aan mensen worden pas lid als ze met de vut gaan en uitgesport zijn een shantykoor of een popkoor trekt meer leden want bij ons koor is het wel nodig om over notenkennis te beschikken en thuis te studeren met oefen cds
6992544 alle aandacht gaat na de zomervakantie uit naar de feestelijkheden
6992545 el problema a su juicio es que la asociaci n nazca con fortaleza y que haya apoyos suficientes y que esos apoyos se sigan manteniendo porque puede pasar que cuando nos vayamos con los cad veres de nuestros familiares nos olvidemos de la asociaci n
6992546 en caliente ha habido insultos entre partes y llegar a un acuerdo sobre una cosa de este tipo pele ndonos no es un buen augurio

6992577 dr thaksin has been really open about this he has said to me if you need me to resign from the football club as a director because it would serve the needs of the premier league then im fine with that as long as that doesnt change any other thing
6992578 i think there is a very loose term about what is fit and proper it is almost a tongue in cheek term that you would use for premier league football over the last 10 years there are plenty of unfit and improper individuals
6992579 dr thaksin is in a political situation and a case that affects his assets so thats well documented so thats a hurdle
6992580 the truth of it is this club is not going to go out of business this club is not bankrupt were moving forward
6992581 he wants to be at this ground on sunday but he is hearing advice about being in a public space

6992586 they like him they want to give him a chance but its a big big job they need some reassurances that hes up to it
6992587 hes not one whos going to shoot from the hip
6992588 i think the personal character is more important than the experience
6992589 its a very complicated job with a lot of pieces that are constantly moving on you
6992590 if the campaign is disorganized and the candidate is disorganized that might be an indication they cant put a white house together
6992591 his experience is certainly not something you would look at and say this is who i want to be leader of the free world
6992592 if a baby is born alive after a botched abortion can be thrown away as medical trash
6992593 every infant born alive even an infant that survives an abortion procedure is considered a human being
6992594 there is no right to destroy a child that has been born alive

6992601 be scared be very very scared but go on with your lives
6992602 i wish that there would be a peer review of this
6992603 i think all the records that nist has assembled should be archived i would really like to see someone else take a look at what theyve done both structurally and from a fire point of view i think the official conclusion that nist arrived at is questionable
6992604 photos of the steel evidence about how the buildings collapsed the unexplainable collapse of wtc 7 evidence of thermite in the debris as well as several other red flags are quite troubling indications of well planned and controlled demolition
6992605 why would all 47 stories of wtc 7 fall straight down to the ground in about seven seconds it was not struck by any aircraft or engulfed in any fire an independent investigation is justified for all three collapses including the surviving steel samples and the composition of the dust
6992606 wtc 7 building could not have collapsed as a result of internal fire and external debris no plane hit this building this is the only case of a steel frame building collapsing through fire in the world the fire on this building was small amp localized therefore what is the cause
6992607 the pullback of russian troops and units passed without incident and was completed on time
6992608 we are not seeing that they are in compliance right now
6992609 they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6992610 the preservation of georgias territorial integrity is impossible without an internationalization of the peacekeeping troops
6992611 i could not have imagined that it would be such a big invasion
6992612 we cannot subject our members to the laws of the government
6992613 good faith to try to stop the conflict from escalating
6992614 the law of the republic of the philippines should prevail and it will be under the law that we will prosecute them and judge them
6992615 we hope the rebels are reasonable enough to see that it does them no good to coddle these criminals

6992622 our business is stable and isnt likely to change so our current skills status is adequate
6992623 i paid my taxes for the educational system i should not have to provide extra training
6992624 is computer science education so out of whack with real world needs that the existence of the field is threatened
6992625 the satisfaction one derives out of doing such work is the reward but in this era of market driven world brand value is fixed for such priceless works it should not be so recognition given to such works is the most important that is why the tourism department of the government is organising workshops exhibitions and seminars to showcase the talents of young artists
6992626 social economic cultural and scientific exchange programmes between russia and india will bring prosperity to both nations
6992627 the exhibition will help create awareness about the traditional art forms of india and also the influence of other cultures on indian art forms
6992628 we at the srijati institute of fashion technology have taken initiatives to promote indian contribution to fashion technology in collaboration with tamil nadu open university and loyola college chennai
6992629 were now getting up to 60 letters a month from teenagers wanting to know how to get bigger thats double the amount compared to 2007
6992630 beckham had the body that teenagers wanted athletic and slim
6992631 but then daniel craig emerged from the sea in casino royale in his pants and all that changed craig is a lot more muscular beefier and that is now the ideal look
6992632 the danger is that many teenagers either take too much of the shakes instead of a nutritious diet
6992633 they will not provide you with the essential vitamins and minerals you get from fresh fruit vegetables and starchy carbs
6992634 everyone is growing up far too quickly some 15 to 16 year old boys are working out like men is this good for them
6992635 i dont think it is it seems like they are losing some of their innocence boys should be boys running around the park with a football not straining themselves pumping iron in the local gym
6992636 i think they need to enjoy their youth and not succumb to this huge pressure to have perfect abs bulging biceps and a ripped torso they have enough to worry about with puberty education
6992637 i dont want to be obese i work out so when its hot i can take my top off with pride i like the admiring looks i get it makes me feel good
6992638 there is pressure on boys to look good now in the past everyone cared about what girls looked like how fat or thin they were but us boys also care
6992639 we want to look buff so thats why we come down the gym
6992640 banks are not caring enough and it is just too hard for the average homeowner to try to do this on their own the banks dont seem to care about whether they want to modify the loan or not
6992641 my experience was that the banks were just not responsive my borrowers were trying to get something done before things got worse yet the banks wanted the clients to be delinquent before they even discuss modifications

6992648 large investor decided to pay a few bucks to a senator in new york to force the issue
6992649 and do remember that there are many investment bankers located in new york making them pretty influential constituents of sen schumer

6992687 when a business says shortage they really mean they are finding it difficult to obtain labor at the wage they are accustomed to paying
6992688 companies spend 50 times more recruiting a candidate than they do training them after theyre hired according to deloitte research only 37 percent of central ohio companies provide general skills training beyond an initial orientation
6992689 many unskilled manufacturing jobs have been replaced with jobs requiring advanced math and computer skills according to the national association of manufacturers the group said 90 percent of manufacturers are suffering from a shortage of skilled workers such as machinists and technicians in part because of trouble recruiting young workers to replace skilled retirees
6992690 the u s department of education estimates only 20 percent of the u s population will have the skills needed to perform 60 percent of the jobs in coming years
6992691 i think its amazing this is the second time ive seen it ive seen the stage show as well so it was hard not to sing along the first time

6992694 this is a great moment in the history of the lipszyc mehaffey memorial libary and trust we finally have some authentic documents to add to our collection on the development of the gaming website design economy and industry but also have the ability to share them with the rest of the world and anyone who has a strong interest in learning more about gaming website design
6992695 were all please by these recent developments and cant wait until mccreadie rojas gaming website design llc the selected restoration firm gets to work putting these papers into digital form
6992696 and once this is done we can begin searching through them for various hidden gaming website design gems
6992697 i came all the way from willibrand shanaa county to witness this great day in the history of shankland wilcoxson and gaming website design documentation and i cant wait to dig in and finish some of my own works
6992698 i and the gaming website design research community are indebt for your wonderful gifts today and we promise to safequard them for future generations
6992699 we all agreed that these items are best left open for all in the long haul we really would not have made that much money on licensing them anyway and this way students and historians in the gaming website design field can use them for further research and studies
6992700 in our initial launchpad article were once again featuring robert pattinson
6992701 now that we have secured the land which for 50p is the bargain of the century it will have enormous benefits for the whole area what we want to do is develop the land so that people across the region will be able to reap its benefits
6992702 it is brilliant for us to have got this 1 000 acre space and we will be able to do so much with it the possibilities for derwent forest are now endless but we will still be looking for investment
6992703 the idea behind carlisle live is create a brand and that doesnt come straight away you have to build it up
6992704 what i want to do is establish a mainstream festival here ive only been running the event for two years now so it would be silly to expect miraculous profits id be more than happy with breaking even
6992705 the majority of the 100 businesses working at the festival are local too all of the bars are run by cumbrians and dempseys restaurant is involved its important to me that local workers benefit from their festival
6992706 were expecting a good crowd just how good depends on the weather you find the weather can make or break these events hopefully this weekend will be made of even bigger and better things than last year its a weekend out for the family not just the teen audience itll take us one step closer to getting carlisle on the map

6992713 the kids field is a riot of colour and activity
6992714 after last years award weve attracted a lot more families so weve quadrupled the number of childrens activities
6992715 weve just had to run around giving all our stewards sun tan lotion
6992716 its also quite good from a health and safety point of view especially if anyone goes missing
6992717 the idea was to create our dream festival really and i think we did that ive been putting in two or three hours a day since last november
6992718 i think itll help build a bit of pride in the area
6992719 at this difficult time management are continuously monitoring the boiler situation and are keeping the workforce and union representatives informed
6992720 we are working together to try and minimise the impact upon our employees and hope to resume production as soon as possible
6992721 in reality he has made nothing from these series of offences because his house has been repossessed and the defendant has no money at all
6992722 what you did over a relatively short period of time in the summer of last year was systematically plunder money from your employers
6992723 the matter is further seriously aggravated by the fact you have four previous convictions all for thefts from your employers
6992724 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6992725 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6992726 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6992727 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6992728 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6992729 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6992730 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6992731 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6992732 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6992733 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre

6992737 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6992738 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6992739 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia

6992748 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
6992749 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6992750 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6992751 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6992752 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6992753 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche

6992763 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6992764 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano

6992771 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6992772 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6992773 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados

6992784 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6992785 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6992786 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6992787 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6992788 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6992789 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6992790 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6992791 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6992792 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6992793 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6992794 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos

6992800 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6992801 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6992802 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6992803 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6992804 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6992805 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6992806 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6992807 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6992808 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6992809 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6992810 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6992811 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6992812 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6992813 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior

6992816 the nnpc expenditure and budgetary activities be made public and subject to the committees scrutiny
6992817 to be prepared for peace is to be prepared for war
6992818 if you buy product x through me im going to sweeten the deal by giving you all these additional bonus products of mine for free
6992819 i dont know if it works but its at least refreshing
6992820 they say its a good recovery but i dont see it yet it just gives me a lot of gas im not a milk dude
6992821 washington and other schools have done it weve had very little cramping or pulls i dont know if it is that or not but it hasnt hurt
6992822 weve got to do better than last year we need to be much more productive this year
6992823 we had to change our identity midway through the season last year because of some things we couldnt do schematically anymore because personnel got hurt
6992824 i think the offense will be ready to go what happened last year could be a blessing in disguise young players got valuable minutes and now theyre proven veteran guys so they can step up and make big plays for us
6992825 as you look at their record the past two years and even before they were 12 1 last year and i think theyve only lost one game in the past two years and their consistency and their execution and how theyre coached and the way they use their talent i have been impressed with that
6992826 they are a pretty good football team and a good program
6992827 we intend to use him in any way possible to help our team
6992828 we know his priority is getting back to full speed at receiver but we also know that as was demonstrated in the scrimmage the other day there is quite a drop off at quarterback if max hall were to go down this gives us a chance to get collies hands on the ball in possibly a few other ways
6992829 but i am going to take the responsibility and try to work with it and get better
6992830 we went up in a cable car and a toboggan down so that was really good fun
6992831 sometimes you see all these people walking around and its like oh my god i just walked past an olympic gold medalist
6992832 everything i imagined the olympics to be imagine that times 10 and thats how it feels to be in the olympics
6992833 when everyone else is lost on the first day i have 70 freshmen who know their way around campus they know their way around the lunch line they know where the library is
6992834 if it does nothing more than reduce their anxiety level then i think weve been successful
6992835 my goal is to get straight as all four years and i want to be a stellar student
6992836 i thought there would be a lot of high schoolers pushing you through the hallways and picking on you
6992837 she said in her whole teaching career shes never seen anyone put in the garbage can
6992838 if you know where everything is theres no excuse to not get good grades or study more
6992839 its not going to bite you you dont need to be afraid of it
6992840 i kind of learned about the school and how it looks like and how to get around a little better
6992841 they tell you to have fun but dont slack off and dont give up because its hard
6992842 if you study in the last minute you will probably fail the test or pop quiz
6992843 you could turn into a person that your parents wouldnt want you to be
6992844 they had to kick me out of iraq i didnt want to leave but i had to go
6992845 i spent a lot of time over there trying to help everybody had some meaning to it
6992846 im a vietnam vet and we were treated pretty badly
6992847 i do what i can to have that not happen to these guys this time
6992848 im thankful to the people who have taken the time out to show us a good time
6992849 this gives us time to relax and shows what life is
6992850 they go through a honeymoon stage where theyre very happy to see people initially but then they start to isolate themselves
6992851 it gets worse until they get help thats the wonderful thing about these events is that we can get their families involved and have an intervention very early we have to get these people back to society
6992852 and we had several children whose parents would normally say their prayers with them they couldnt sleep without them
6992853 its my professional responsibility as a chaplain for pastoral care
6992854 a lot of our work is just being present you dont have to say anything just show that youre there and you care
6992855 i would have felt really really supported here its nice to do something when your parents away just to get you distracted just to make you feel like he was home its very hard to talk about it sometimes i cant really compare it to having someone die but its kind of like that memory like theyre not there its a loss that is it stays with you
6992856 i know how that feels but i really still dont know what to say coming here i think im learning a bit more how to support them by getting to know the kids and then realizing that you have something in common
6992857 meant a barbecue in the summer and some auxiliary fund raisers and a christmas party
6992858 if you could draw a picture of your feelings during the deployment what would it be
6992859 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
6992860 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6992861 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
6992862 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
6992863 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6992864 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6992865 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6992866 jai toujours eu piti des l gumes lyophilis s quelle vie pr tendre quand on a perdu son humidit
6992867 barack has chosen joe biden to be his running mate
6992868 joe biden brings extensive foreign policy experience an impressive record of collaborating across party lines and a direct approach to getting the job done
6992869 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
6992870 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realising that barack obama is not ready to be president
6992871 ich hasse vegetarier die essen meinem essen das essen weg
6992872 nor intercessor will the wrongdoers have who could be listened to
6992873 beware of injustice injustice will be darkness on the day of rising beware of avarice avarice destroyed those before you and prompted them to shed each others blood and make lawful what was unlawful
6992874 rights will be given to those to whom they are owed on the day of rising until even the hornless sheep will have retaliation from the horned sheep
6992875 we used to talk about the farewell hajj while the prophet may allah bless him and grant him peace was still among us and we did not know what the farewell hajj was
6992876 if anyone wrongs someone else even to the extent of a piece of land measuring a hands width his neck will be encircled with it from the the seven earths
6992877 allah prolongs the life of the unjust but when he takes them he will not let them escape then he recited
6992878 the messenger of allah may allah bless him and grant him peace sent me and said you are going to a people who have a book
6992879 the prophet may allah bless him and grant him peace appointed a man from al azd called ibn al lutiyya to collect the zakat
6992880 this is for you and this was given as a gift to me
6992881 whoever has done an injustice to his brother with regard to his honour or anything else should seek to be absolved by him before the day when there will be neither dinar nor dirham if he has right actions they will be taken from him to counterbalance the injustice he did and if he does not have any good actions some of the bad actions of his friend will be taken and he will be made to carry them
6992882 a muslim is someone from whose tongue and hand the muslims are safe an emigrant muhajir is someone who leaves behind what allah has forbidden
6992883 there was a man called kirkara who used to look after the family and goods of the prophet he died and the messenger of allah may allah bless him and grant him peace said he is in the fire they went to look and found a cloak that he had stolen
6992884 time has continued cyclically in the same way since the day allah created the heavens and the earth
6992885 your blood your property and your honour are sacred to you like the sacredness of this day in this month in this city you will meet your lord and he will ask you about your actions so do not revert to being unbelievers after i have gone striking one anothers necks let the one who is present convey to the one who is absent perhaps the one to whom it is conveyed will retain it better those who are present
6992886 have i not conveyed it have i not conveyed it
6992887 allah has made the fire mandatory for anyone who usurps the right of another muslim by an oath and has forbidden him the garden
6992888 even if it is only something little messenger of allah
6992889 i heard the messenger of allah may allah bless him and grant him peace say anyone among you we put in charge of something who then conceals a needle or anything larger from us that is misappropriation which he will have to account for on the day of rising
6992890 on the day of khaybar a group of the companions of the prophet came forward and said so and so has been martyred and so and so has been martyred until they passed by a man and said of him so and so has been martyred
6992891 messenger of allah tell me if i am killed in the way of allah will my sins be absolved
6992892 yes if you are killed in the way of allah and you are steadfast expecting the reward advancing and not retreating
6992893 tell me if i am killed in the way of allah will my sins be absolved
6992894 yes if you are killed in the way of allah and you are steadfast expecting the reward advancing and not retreating except for the debt jibril just said that to me
6992895 the destitute among us are those who have no money or property
6992896 the truly destitute person among my community is someone who comes on the day of rising with prayer fasting and zakat but having insulted this person and slandered that person and consumed the property of this person and shed the blood of that person and beaten that person he will give this person some of his good deeds and that one some of his good deeds if his good deeds are wiped out before he has paid what he owes some of their wrong actions are taken and thrown on him and then he is thrown into the fire
6992897 i am a human being and you bring your disputes to me it may be that one of you is more eloquent in stating his case than another and so i give judgement in his favour according to what i hear if i award him judgement at the expense of the right of his brother i am cutting out a piece of the fire for him
6992898 a believer will remain within the bounds of his religion as long as he does not spill blood unlawfully
6992899 i heard the messenger of allah may allah bless him and grant him peace say men who spend out the property of allah without due right will go to the fire on the day of rising

6992902 you know shifting the ball a lot quicker player movement around the pitch were gonna tweak the system slightly but really just get that energy level back
6992903 i think thats a compliment perhaps to what weve done in a short period of time
6992904 weve got some very good players at the club and i think quite rightly people will be looking round as expansion of the league comes on who might be available to move to other clubs
6992905 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6992906 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6992907 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6992908 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6992909 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6992910 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6992911 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6992912 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6992913 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6992914 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6992915 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6992916 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6992917 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6992918 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6992919 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6992920 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6992921 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6992922 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6992923 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6992924 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6992925 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6992926 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6992927 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6992928 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6992929 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6992930 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6992931 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6992932 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6992933 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6992934 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6992935 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6992936 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6992937 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6992938 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6992939 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6992940 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6992941 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6992942 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6992943 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6992944 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6992945 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6992946 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6992947 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6992948 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6992949 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6992950 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6992951 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6992952 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6992953 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6992954 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6992955 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6992956 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6992957 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6992958 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6992959 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6992960 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6992961 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6992962 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6992963 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6992964 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6992965 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6992966 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6992967 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6992968 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6992969 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6992970 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6992971 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6992972 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6992973 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6992974 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6992975 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6992976 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6992977 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6992978 the only way i could win here is if the judges got knocked out
6992979 i will be the first to admit that not every point scored in boxing is recorded
6992980 there will be points missed but we know most of the time that the right boxer wins the contest
6992981 we have got an ongoing investigation and we hope to secure the information we need to bring this to a conclusion
6992982 for 20 years this has been an organisation that has been under a cloud of suspicion but we have seen in the last year or so under the new reforms that that suspicion has been largely reduced
6992983 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6992984 um put an egg in boiling water for a while

6992987 las razones para que se pueda recorrer m s o menos pista en el despegue son m ltiples y variadas
6992988 el piloto apura al m ximo las posibilidades que da la pista
6992989 hay una prolongaci n de seguridad de la pista y parece que el avi n no coge la altura que en situaciones de normalidad estamos acostumbrados a ver un avi n a mitad de pista coge altura y aqu necesita m s pista para alcanzar esos metros
6992990 hemos estado muy descontentos con la reacci n de la compa a en los primeros momentos reconoci no solamente el gobierno de canarias sino que tambi n el presidente del gobierno me ha trasladado que la compa a no estuvo a la altura

6992997 we simply want the federation to work with the national federation to just put to bed once and for all the questions
6992998 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6992999 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger

6993099 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6993100 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6993101 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6993102 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6993103 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6993104 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6993105 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6993106 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6993107 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely

6993109 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6993110 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6993111 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities

6993114 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations

6993116 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6993117 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did

6993122 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6993123 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6993124 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6993125 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6993126 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6993127 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6993128 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6993129 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6993130 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6993131 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6993132 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6993133 this is a planning took where all things are going
6993134 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6993135 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6993136 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6993137 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6993138 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6993139 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6993140 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6993141 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6993142 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6993143 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6993144 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6993145 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6993146 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6993147 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6993148 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6993149 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6993150 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6993151 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6993152 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6993153 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6993154 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6993155 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6993156 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6993157 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6993158 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6993159 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6993160 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6993161 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6993162 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

6993185 theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun and a verb and 9 11
6993186 back in 1971 the year i graduated from high school then there was
6993187 and so many more i guess the younger set will remember him as chef in the show
6993188 mostly because he would give a big shot of energy to the ticket
6993189 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6993190 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6993191 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6993192 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6993193 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6993194 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6993195 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6993196 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6993197 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6993198 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6993199 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6993200 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6993201 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6993202 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6993203 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6993204 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6993205 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6993206 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6993207 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6993208 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6993209 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6993210 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6993211 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6993212 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6993213 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6993214 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6993215 internet explorer cannot open operation aborted my music was playing on my blog and i could see the front page but that was it
6993216 there will be no costs associated with this rebrand which is simply a new logo
6993217 we do not have printed letterheads our stationery is held on electronic template and items such as information booklets will only be reprinted as stocks run out
6993218 signage will be replaced when it is beyond economical repair and identity badges and uniforms will use the new logo only when new ones are issued
6993219 we want our local community to gain a better understanding of what we are here to do
6993220 as nhs heywood middleton and rochdale we will continue to drive and develop local health services now and for the future in what is the 60th anniversary of the nhs we face exciting and challenging times
6993221 i would argue that this move is both unnecessary and costly the pct should be putting the care of patients first instead of their public image
6993222 as is the normal practice with new traffic signals it could be quite a few months before the optimum timings are in place
6993223 once the schools go back traffic levels will increase so working together with greater manchester urban traffic control who control all traffic signals in greater manchester we will need to refine the timings again
6993224 our number one priority is safety and the junction is already operating far more efficiently and safer than the roundabout did and we are working with utc to ensure that any changes to the signals maintain or improve this
6993225 you do not need to be a university graduate to see the problems and what is causing them they have spent thousands of pounds there but it just hasnt worked
6993226 a pedestrian has already been knocked down and it will happen again
6993227 the impression i get from speaking to the highways department is that they think it is not that important
6993228 but something needs to be done today is not soon enough
6993229 i am absolutely appalled because they keep making the same mistakes
6993230 i live in halifax road and use that junction every day and there are issues which need resolving
6993231 i think rossendale has not quite understood that climate change is a serious problem and they have responsibilities to do something about it
6993232 they have targets for renewable energy and have failed to demonstrate they care they have a target
6993233 in my opinion this is a local council saying sorry it is not our problem
6993234 we do not believe the benefits of carbon reductions will be outweighed by the harmful impact to the local environment and community if an area of deep peat is disturbed
6993235 the whole development site is also underlain by mine shafts some charted and some unknown any attempts to grout up or cement pile voids could have a knock on effect on the spring water supplies to dwellings in the area
6993236 its early doors and as the season progresses we will probably know more about ourselves and the opposition
6993237 i know bradford have had a good start but we have had a good start they are a good side but we are a good side and we go there full of confidence and i dont see why we shouldnt
6993238 we approach every game with a winning mentality and why should it be any different because its bradford and they are one of the favourites to get automatic promotion
6993239 every game is a challenge and over two 90 minute games in a season i think we have got parity with bradford in respect of our playing squad
6993240 but we are probably poles apart in terms of fan base training facilities and resources on a saturday or a tuesday night when we play them over 90 minutes i think we are equal and its a good opportunity for players to show that
6993241 lee thorpe needed a game james spencer needed a game marcus holness needed a game it is a necessity they get 90 minutes under their belts on a regular basis especially as they have been sidelined by injury for months
6993242 we had a few problems on the day as mark jones couldnt play because of an infection in his foot so he is possibly going to be pushed back another week or so
6993243 for 55 or 60 minutes it was a very even contest until tiredness took over especially among the lads who havent been playing on a regular basis
6993244 it has some zooplankton but overwhelmingly what were seeing here are plastic particles
6993245 the ocean has become a plastic soup this is the soup
6993246 formerly we got sand by breaking down rock and coral now were getting sand by breaking down plastic
6993247 and we eventually get dust our concern is that this dust then goes to the molecular level and invades the entire food web in the ocean
6993248 no matter whether youre studying the surface 10 meters 30 meter samples or 100 meter samples every sample that weve looked at in the pacific ocean has had plastic in it
6993249 and so many catholics that will be a big adjustment for me i think just getting used to many more people and learning how to do ministry to many people than i have before so that will be the biggest challenge for me to personally overcome
6993250 lots of edible arts to sample theres specialties mexican jamaican greek
6993251 i think its really cool i love listening to music and meeting new people its really fun
6993252 tonights art is music so we come here for the music and then tomorrow we come back and check out all the art and spend the money all the big money
6993253 weve been really steady and strong for 27 years and i think a lot of that is due to the support that we get from the people that just come down year after year
6993254 gets bigger every year theres a lot of cool art from around the nation a lot of fun i like that
6993255 instead of having them drinking and driving or walking through neighborhoods and being loud we put them on buses with trained drivers and security systems on the buses
6993256 for the evening service were looking at routes that would hit a lot of areas where students live as well as shopping opportunities entertainment opportunities where students might work places like that as well as connecting with some of the labs
6993257 transportation is difficult so difficult i think they need to improve it
6993258 we didnt talk at all out there were best friends we train together and we just kind of knew when to kick at the right time
6993259 disabled people have as much right and desire as able bodied people to compete
6993260 its important that disabled people have the opportunity to experience competition and the emotions attached with winning and losing
6993261 the majority of young people use public transport responsibly but its very easy for them to end up in serious trouble without intending to
6993262 there is cctv in bus shelters across greater manchester we have a dedicated patrol and response unit for the bus network and there are travel safe officers on metrolink trams
6993263 louise has greatly exceeded all our expectations this season we are excited by things to come
6993264 louise always has a smile on her face and a good attitude in training she loves the challenge of learning new skating skills
6993265 stephen and karen are extremely accomplished skaters and coaches and louise is very lucky to have such wonderful teachers
6993266 sucks that were downtown too many witnesses if you dont pick up after him

6993299 i had dated a lot of brothers who had this kind of reputation coming in so i figured he was one of those smooth brothers who could talk straight and impress people so we had lunch and he had this bad sports jacket and a cigarette dangling from his mouth and i thought ive been down this road before
6993300 even though my father depended on the assistance of a cane and eventually a motorised cart even though he was in pain he was never late and never complained
6993301 he did it every single day so he could send me and my brother to some of the best schools in the country his priority was to provide for his family and give his children the tools to succeed in life and he did

6993358 tiada siapa pun yang lebih tahu selain daripada saya dan anwar telah berbohong dengan pelbagai tuduhan terhadap datuk seri najib
6993359 rakyat makin keliru kerana pembohongan semakin menjadi jadi dan saya rasa malu kerana nama pemimpin negara tak berkaitan dengan kes ini telah diburukkan oleh anwar dan raja petra
6993360 sangat sangat memalukan apabila nama pemimpin negara kita diburukkan di luar negara seolah olah terbabit dalam kes ini dan disebabkan itulah saya terpaksa menjelaskan kepada orang ramai mengenai pembohongan yang berlaku

6993442 youre going to play a whole half and you usually come out in the second half and play that first series where you really try to go out there and be sharp and make sure everybodys on the same page youre making plays youre not having the mental mistakes and youve put all that behind you and youre out there executing the game plan well
6993443 it will be good just to kind of see how we do in a full half to get in a little bit more of a rhythm and to get a sense of how the game should be played

6993452 dr thaksin has been really open about this he has said to me if you need me to resign from the football club as a director because it would serve the needs of the premier league then im fine with that as long as that doesnt change any other thing
6993453 i think there is a very loose term about what is fit and proper it is almost a tongue in cheek term that you would use for premier league football over the last 10 years there are plenty of unfit and improper individuals
6993454 dr thaksin is in a political situation and a case that affects his assets so thats well documented so thats a hurdle

6993462 in an earlier survey on the election and health care reform physicians were fairly evenly divided as to the solution for improving our health care system
6993463 twenty seven percent said it was universal health care with multi payer reimbursement twenty three percent said it was universal health care with single payer reimbursement and twenty five percent selected tax credits to allow more people to afford healthcare
6993464 universal health care would reduce my income in the short term but the longer term effect would be good since the current system isnt sustainable
6993465 more regulatory and bureaucratic hoops to jump through decreased income perhaps a decreased workload as access to care plummets

6993531 but if after all this you were to break your word god would make a hell only for you to howl in for ever
6993532 i am glad to see that your gate is well enough guarded to make it hard for anyone to be here who was not a delegate
6993533 i should call it at the very least a root
6993534 the truth is i am a sabbatarian i have been specially sent here to see that you show a due observance of sunday
6993535 i suppose wed better give you a seat in the meeting
6993536 the steam tug is waiting on the river already i move that comrade buttons takes the chair
6993537 our meeting to night is important though it need not be long this branch has always had the honour of electing thursdays for the central european council we have elected many and splendid thursdays we all lament the sad decease of the heroic worker who occupied the post until last week as you know his services to the cause were considerable he organised the great dynamite coup of brighton which under happier circumstances ought to have killed everybody on the pier as you also know his death was as self denying as his life for he died through his faith in a hygienic mixture of chalk and water as a substitute for milk which beverage he regarded as barbaric and as involving cruelty to the cow cruelty or anything approaching to cruelty revolted him always but it is not to acclaim his virtues that we are met but for a harder task it is difficult properly to praise his qualities but it is more difficult to replace them upon you comrades it devolves this evening to choose out of the company present the man who shall be thursday if any comrade suggests a name i will put it to the vote if no comrade suggests a name i can only tell myself that that dear dynamiter who is gone from us has carried into the unknowable abysses the last secret of his virtue and his innocence
6993538 i will call on comrade gregory to make a statement
6993539 it is not necessary for me to tell you what is my policy for it is your policy also
6993540 there will be no difficulty about the aims which we shall pursue as a body or which i should pursue were i chosen as the representative of that body superbly careless of the slanders that represent us as assassins and enemies of human society we shall pursue with moral courage and quiet intellectual pressure the permanent ideals of brotherhood and simplicity
6993541 have we come here for this do we live underground like rats in order to listen to talk like this this is talk we might listen to while eating buns at a sunday school treat do we line these walls with weapons and bar that door with death lest anyone should come and hear comrade gregory saying to us be good and you will be happy honesty is the best policy and virtue is its own reward there was not a word in comrade gregorys address to which a curate could not have listened with pleasure hear hear but i am not a curate loud cheers and i did not listen to it with pleasure renewed cheers the man who is fitted to make a good curate is not fitted to make a resolute forcible and efficient thursday hear hear
6993542 comrade gregory has told us in only too apologetic a tone that we are not the enemies of society but i say that we are the enemies of society and so much the worse for society we are the enemies of society for society is the enemy of humanity its oldest and its most pitiless enemy hear hear comrade gregory has told us apologetically again that we are not murderers there i agree we are not murderers we are executioners cheers
6993543 i do not go to the council to rebut that slander that calls us murderers i go to earn it loud and prolonged cheering
6993544 i move as an amendment that comrade syme be appointed to the post
6993545 but i give you a counsel which you can call mad if you like no i will not call it a counsel for i can give you no reason for it i will call it a command call it a mad command but act upon it strike but hear me kill me but obey me do not elect this man
6993546 it is nothing to me whether you detest me as a tyrant or detest me as a slave if you will not take my command accept my degradation i kneel to you i throw myself at your feet i implore you do not elect this man
6993547 the question is that comrade syme be elected to the post of thursday on the general council
6993548 into what sort of devils parliament have you entrapped me if it comes to that you made me swear before i made you perhaps we are both doing what we think right but what we think right is so damned different that there can be nothing between us in the way of concession there is nothing possible between us but honour and death
6993549 you are a man of honour and i thank you you have kept it even down to a small particular there was one special thing you promised me at the beginning of the affair and which you have certainly given me by the end of it

6993581 lo que dicen las c maras es que no hubo ninguna explosi n durante el despegue

6993583 que se est n dando informaciones amarillas y malintencionadas sobre lo que es llanamente un accidente
6993584 se adoptaron todas las medidas de seguridad que se pudieron tomar
6993585 ya que no se puede olvidar que el piloto siempre es el primer interesado en la seguridad del veh culo que lidera puesto que va en primera fila del mismo
6993586 es el medio m s seguro que existe ya que los aviones sufren un examen cada d a y otro antes de cada vuelo aunque casos como ste sean m s espectaculares que los que se cobran las carreteras de nuestro pa s cada d a
6993587 con sistemas abrumadores de control y con una formaci n continua de sus trabajadores

6993663 i am single and looking and am told by pogo chatters that i am funny i have a serious side and am very opinionated about things in our world and life in general i dont smoke and drink socially and i am a great cook
6993664 i am the last born of a big family and also a twin my parents were in the navy so we traveled around a bit and then decided to settle in georgia no i am not a peach per se but
6993665 i was born and raised a redneck from the south in my home town of wichita kansas but i now live in michigan i enjoy football camping occasionally visiting the casino and playing pogo games
6993666 i am 20 years old i am self revealing neat unpredictable silly charming aggressive assertive organized and far from ordinary i happen to be a social chameleon
6993667 quiero a alguien capaz de retar mis ideas y no simplemente a alguien que diga que s a todo
6993668 there was also a minor flap when ron brown refused to let governor bob casey speak to the convention not because he wanted to speak against abortion but because he wouldnt agree to endorse me ron was adamant we could disagree on the issues he said but no one should get the microphone who wasnt committed to victory in november
6993669 you know there there are some things that even i dont know and what michelle is gonna wear is a tightly held secret more tightly held than who my vice presidential choice is gonna be
6993670 the third criteria from me i think was independence i want somebody who is gonna be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a a yes person when it comes to policies
6993671 its a little disappointing i i mean you know john mccain likes to characterize himself as a maverick but the truth is what hes done particularly over the last month when he shook up his campaign is he basically hired karl roves old old crew and adopted karl roves old tactics which really had to do with suggesting that i was unpatriotic
6993672 i want to make the choice clear to the american people for the last eight years weve had a particular set of economic policies that have resulted in record foreclosures high unemployment high inflation and so i want the american people to focus on whether or not we can afford to continue those policies for another four or eight years because thats essentially what john mccains offering
6993673 let us hope that the inquiry in fact does not find that children have been effectively kidnapped
6993674 but if they have then we will have a moral responsibility to do the right thing and the right thing we would expect in most cases will be to look at returning them to their rightful families
6993675 i dont think that we should have knee jerk responses that suggest that the commonwealth should automatically take it over so lets just wait until we get the outcome of the inquiry before people start to say well if the commonwealth takes it over that will solve all the problems generally speaking government is the problem not the solution
6993676 you can have a rotating storm but until you have rain you dont get a tornado
6993677 the hook echo is usually thought to be a passive feature of tornadoes
6993678 im saying its not passive its an active mechanism for tornado formation
6993679 but until these things are seen more conclusively out in the field its not at all clear whether rain is involved in the formation of most tornadoes a few or none at all
6993680 if you are asking if i had an orgasm yes it was a job sir
6993681 i didnt have pleasure doing this i was paid to do it
6993682 operations research offers a powerful set of tools that have been used successfully in everything from world war ii to wal mart style logistics planning these tools ought to be used to increase the success of existing programs and to help expand access to hiv care and treatment in resource limited countries
6993683 for example operations research could help with the planning of a national drug distribution system or with predicting the demand for services at local clinics and the best ways to staff them
6993684 to date hiv treatment scale up has appropriately focused first on policy level issues such as program initiation and costs and secondarily on operational level issues now that many programs are in place the potential gains from improved planning are great especially given the high cost of antiretroviral drug therapy
6993685 the analysis suggested that implementation of such a program could allow the government of rwanda to scale up hiv treatment without overburdening its existing health care system
6993686 the unique advantage of operations research is that it gives us the ability to evaluate and optimise outcomes of various scenarios such as determining the best approach for the management of lab equipment repair without impacting patients once we have the evidence for a new approach a good case can be made that it should be implemented as policy although any initiative should take into account the environments in which the projects are to be carried out with all necessary ethical cultural and political considerations
6993687 while laudable progress has been made the great majority of hiv patients are still under treated or untreated
6993688 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6993689 a vote is like a rifle its usefulness depends upon the character of the user
6993690 because of its focus on female empowerment young women are attracted by wicca popularised by the tv series buffy the vampire slayer
6993691 young women tend to express egalitarian values and dislike the traditionalism and hierarchies they imagine are integral to the church
6993692 womens ordination as priests and now bishops has dominated debate and headlines but while looking at women in the pulpit we have taken our eyes off the pews where a shift with more consequences for the churchs survival is underway
6993693 gone are the days when the mother was at home during the day and had time to visit the churchs coffee mornings and mother and toddler groups
6993694 with the pressures women face churches must adapt to make themselves more accessible
6993695 what this research reveals is that a lot of people are put off by traditional stances and attitudes we still have a long way to go before women particularly young women feel as included in the church as men do
6993696 im absolutely convinced that when we have women as bishops that it will send out a very clear message that women are as valued as much as men

6993750 we want to deliver instruction through the latest technology to the kids
6993751 we hope we will become one of the leading technological districts in pennsylvania but were also embracing another culture thats becoming a world leader
6993752 parents will be able by mid year using name and password to log in and bring up their children and check their grades and attendance
6993753 it sends out phone messages or e mail messages to parents within minutes each person can have up to six numbers in the phone bank
6993754 we could have instantly sent messages to parents of high school students
6993755 within five to 10 minutes everyone would have been contacted
6993756 each child is assessed with the use of an electronic palm pilot

6993870 iubirea de flori a chiriasului impinsa la patima adaoga o nebuneasca risipa de trandafiri si de tiparoase ce impreuna cu lumanarile pe cari le gaseam aprinse in cele doua candelabre de argint cu cate cinci ramuri oricand am fi venit puneau locuintei pecetea unui lux ales alcatuind oaspelui meu un cadru in asa armonie cu fiinta sa ca amintirea mea dintr insul nu l pot desprinde

6993887 im gonna continue to build the character with films comics i hate to sound so business push with it but i see bobby digital as being a potential franchise for hip hop he aint too watered down he aint too soft he aint too good hes got a little bit of everything in him that people can relate to so im gonna try to develop him like that i think he will have more adventures
6993888 theyre low budget films but theyve got a vibe to them and i think they offer the hip hop community something when i was first doing it it felt like i couldve had a bigger budget but now it feels like a classic

6993927 turkey is obliged by its eu course to recognize the republic of cyprus to implement the eu customs union agreement and to set a timeframe for the withdrawal from cyprus of the turkey s troops and the settlers
6993928 with the maximum unity in order to achieve under the un auspices an agreed just viable and functional solution without strict timeframes and arbitration
6993929 the solution of the cyprus problem should end the turkish military occupation remove the turkish settlers respect and guarantee the basic freedoms and human rights for all the legitimate citizens of cyprus implement the eu and international law principles for all the cypriots
6993930 in addition the solution should guarantee the unity sovereignty and independence of cyprus and provide the full demilitarization of the island a solution that provides for a federal republic of cyprus without foreign armies and any rights of intervention with a single international personality a single sovereignty and a single citizenship
6993931 the return of famagusta under turkish occupation since 1974 to its lawful inhabitants

6993933 i find that attending industry related social functions conferences and even my neighbors cocktail parties help me find new ways of growing my company
6993934 by asking the right people the right questions youll find that you can learn new things and different strategies for your e gaming photographic images firm that you may not have thought of before
6993935 many e gaming photographic images companies go pel mel spending money when there is a good cash flow while there is nothing wrong with wanting to expand it has to be done in accordance with accounting standards and detailed record keeping this is especially true for public companies private e gaming photographic images firms can sometimes let this aspect of the business slide alittle
6993936 starting up any e gaming photographic images business is difficult in our case it took about 6 months of planning a year of fund raising and then another 6 months of building infrastructure before we made our first sale
6993937 if you walk up to someone and say ive got a great e gaming photographic images business idea would you contribute 100k theyll probably laugh and consider you a lunatic but if you approach someone and say look i have this great idea and my plan is the following it will reassure an anxious investor that things will move forward with thought and purpose
6993938 in the case of our e gaming photographic images marketing venture we initially started out with a simple website and then slowly grew as sales increased
6993939 then the website expanded into a data warehouse essentially a store of all things related to our marketing campaigns which allowed us to study and refine subsequent efforts
6993940 one has to balance artistic talent with the rigors of usable multimedia

6993960 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
6993961 watch the first obama biden rally live at 3pm et on www barackobama com
6993962 im excited about hitting the campaign trail with joe but the two of us cant do it alone
6993963 we need your help to keep building this movement for change
6993964 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6993965 rest traveller rest and banish thoughts of care drink to thy friends and recommend them here
6993966 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
6993967 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
6993968 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
6993969 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
6993970 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
6993971 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
6993972 were always evaluating whats happening in the marketplace and certainly something thats happening in the last couple of months is that sonys managed to sell some boxes
6993973 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6993974 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6993975 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6993976 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color

6993979 we felt it was the best we could do and will take it to the association executive board and general membership
6993980 was walking straight into the train as it was approaching her and there was no attempt to get out of the way
6993981 can i try it on can i try it on
6993982 ive been in the navy 30 years and ive never heard of an aircraft carrier doing this
6993983 i want them to come away with a positive outlook saying that the navy is a great place
6993984 i think its cool being in the navy doing this all the time
6993985 usually with these guns i dont know their true power because i just play the video games
6993986 ive only been on a cruise ship before the military ship is cooler
6993987 i gave up the second most important job in government for eight long years as roosevelts spare tire
6993988 the office until recently was completely meaningless in every way
6993989 its almost inevitable we keep seeing this growth of power
6993990 whoever the pick is will have a significant role as a strategist in terms of what the administration should do politically as an attack dog to go and say things the president might not be able to say and finally in terms of a policy maker
6993991 folks who dont get along during primary campaigns or people who are competitors can still be on each others ticket it tells you that
6993992 johnson hates kennedy johnson wants to be president that was kennedys effort to bridge the regional division in the party south and north the boston austin connection
6993993 it was a model of a successful partnership where it really enhanced the ticket allowed kennedy to win and achieve more prominence in the south than otherwise would have been possible
6993994 my ambition since my senior year in high school was to be a senator not everybody achieves their ambition i got to the level that i really had no great right to claim
6993995 walter mondale takes the biggest role that we had seen for a vice president and really starts to play a big role in policy in part because carter was unknown in congress and not liked and mondale was liked
6993996 he was popular not just with legislators but powerful interest groups and the democratic party
6993997 our relationship depended on trust mutual respect and an acknowledgement that there was only one agenda to be served the presidents
6993998 by the end of four years we had completed the executivization of the vice presidency ending two centuries of confusion derision and irrelevance surrounding the office
6993999 the revelation of that stuff dooms her as a positive in the campaign
6994000 there was no balance no regional balance no political balance but it was a message that they were trying to express and that seemed to work
6994001 that one day id have the chance to come here to madison square garden and be the warm up act for elvis
6994002 ive defined my job in exactly the same way for six years now to do everything i can to help him be the best president possible
6994003 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
6994004 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system

6994006 the open court rule which is extremely historically important has now become distorted by the effect of massive search engines
6994007 we know for certain that narragansett bay is warmer on average and at the extremes than at any other time in recorded history
6994008 over the past 30 years the average mean temperature of the bay has gone up two degrees fahrenheit the average winter temperature has increased four degrees
6994009 warmer temperatures have caused dramatic changes at many levels and most have a distinctly negative environmental and economic impact
6994010 the bays animal and plant communities are fundamentally shifting critical habitats are threatened environmental quality and even public health and human life and property are jeopardized
6994011 they are nervous about the changes necessary as we move to a green economy
6994012 we are not responding as a society to this threat as rapidly as we should
6994013 that is coming on us with very very serious and broad implications it looks like its worse than people thought and the timeline for action is more urgent than many believe
6994014 and the rate at which it is occurring is unprecedented the natural response is outpacing our ability to predict the change which place all of us at a disadvantage that will have dire consequences unless we act quickly
6994015 it is unequivocal that climate change is happening and human conduct is the cause
6994016 narragansett bay is already seeing the effects of climate change sea level rise will occur but we must monitor this closely because both the timing and magnitude are still uncertain water temperatures will continue to increase and impact the coastal and bay ecosystems hurricane and tropical storm trends have the potential to inflict great damage and coupled with increased sea level we should be taking a precautionary approach so that coastal communities become resilient to the possible impacts
6994017 react more strongly to climate change if it had a face was considered immoral and was understood as a present danger with local impact
6994018 i really believed that my congressional colleagues on the committee would experience the same epiphany i had when they heard this great scientists clear analysis i couldnt have been more wrong the urgency simply didnt come across id seriously underestimated the resistance and disinterest this alarming prognosis of global warming would meet
6994019 making a global problem a local one people can see the specifics of how climate change affects their local economy and their local ecosystems
6994020 i try to buy businesses that are so good an idiot could run them because someday one will
6994021 human beings cannot survive unless they create a provision for the future
6994022 which begs the question if his own wife doesnt trust him with her money why should we trust him with ours
6994023 ahhh im not sure i got to concentrate here on my work
6994024 he said all we have to do is find a really rich country like switzerland and marry it
6994025 all of boston is to be placed under house arrest for four days later this month luciannes rhyming readers have responded with their own verses a sample
6994026 hes basically a skirt chaser folks hes a gigolo well there arent too many of these companies that have little heiresses running around that are single have 500 million that some guy can marry into
6994027 hes basically a skirt chaser folks hes a gigolo well there arent too many of these companies that have little heiresses running around that are single have 500 million that some guy can marry into
6994028 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
6994029 last ditch effort to help save the planet from irrevocable change
6994030 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6994031 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6994032 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6994033 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6994034 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6994035 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6994036 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6994037 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6994038 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6994039 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6994040 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6994041 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6994042 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6994043 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6994044 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6994045 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6994046 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6994047 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
6994048 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
6994049 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6994050 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6994051 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6994052 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6994053 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6994054 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6994055 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6994056 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6994057 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6994058 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
6994059 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6994060 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6994061 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6994062 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6994063 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6994064 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6994065 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6994066 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6994067 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6994068 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6994069 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6994070 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6994071 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6994072 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6994073 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6994074 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6994075 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign

6994109 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6994110 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6994111 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them

6994127 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6994128 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6994129 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6994130 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6994131 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6994132 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6994133 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6994134 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6994135 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6994136 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6994137 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions

6994158 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6994159 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6994160 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday

6994164 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
6994165 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners

6994169 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
6994170 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
6994171 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
6994172 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
6994173 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
6994174 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6994175 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed

6994187 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6994188 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6994189 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6994190 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6994191 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6994192 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc

6994211 die waren niet allemaal even eenvoudig te beantwoorden en de vragen gaven ons ook hints over hoe we de aanbesteding nog beter konden formuleren
6994212 maar het nadeel is dat we nu weten hoeveel haken en ogen er kleven aan zon procedure we vroegen ons van tevoren al af of het haalbaar was om de boeken aan te besteden daar zijn we niet echt optimistischer over geworden
6994213 dat heb je altijd als je de eerste bent die iets doet

6994259 apart from the serious film buffs most people will not have heard of him but during his 10 15 year stretch as a film actor he was a major star with the studios earning 2 000 a week
6994260 he had all the trappings two houses a stables home help everything you imagine the stars have today
6994261 he came from a working class family in dafen and walked all the way to london he would have been 16 or 17 years old to be an actor on the stage
6994262 he joined a group of welsh players who went over to the states and although they were not successful and came back he remained behind
6994263 his career just took off because he was very successful on the stage in broadway in new york and there he was obviously seen by the right people and persuaded to get involved in the new fangled picture business
6994264 he made 45 films melodramas comedies he was part of the studio stable so did what ever they wanted him to do
6994265 i think it was a choice on his behalf to leave the business
6994266 oh um the guy thought the victims were gang members

6994361 they like him they want to give him a chance but its a big big job they need some reassurances that hes up to it
6994362 hes not one whos going to shoot from the hip
6994363 i think the personal character is more important than the experience
6994364 its a very complicated job with a lot of pieces that are constantly moving on you
6994365 if the campaign is disorganized and the candidate is disorganized that might be an indication they cant put a white house together
6994366 his experience is certainly not something you would look at and say this is who i want to be leader of the free world

6994380 within the first five months of 2008 wed seen a 382 percent increase in crack cocaine purchases and a 283 percent increase in powder cocaine purchases
6994381 there were so many things going through the kids minds this week with matt
6994382 our kids loved him he was well loved by everybody its hard to focus when you have something like that happen football isnt real important at that point
6994383 i told them before they came out to just play and make him proud because you never know when you will have the opportunity to do it again
6994384 i was really mad after the first one though when i missed the extra point but i came back for the second touchdown and never looked back
6994385 i was so nervous when the ball was coming i just wanted to secure the catch and fall down i was so excited it was a big moment for me
6994386 we really needed this we were emotionally hurt and we wanted to show everybody we were still strong i wanted to play this game for matt and my grandfather who passed away it meant a lot to all of us
6994387 we werent trying to kick it to number eight we were trying to kick it over
6994388 but he still had to pick up the ball and go down and score we missed some tackles and you cant give up plays like that
6994389 every time we had a positive we would get called for a hold or something else would happen we made it easy for them
6994390 we were able to make some plays on defense and in the kicking game
6994391 but wooster is a good team though and theyll win some games
6994392 they still had their first team defense in at the end because they were worried
6994393 well move forward and remain positive but when you mistakes its tough
6994394 it is our argument that estills time and attention to law enforcement duties is equivalent to that of the sheriff
6994395 it could be more than 40 hours or less than 40 hours whatever the job deems necessary for me
6994396 confusing for us by saying just full time and nothing else
6994397 its a very vital part of the community because a lot depend on the forestry industry
6994398 our kids really strapped it up tonight and made plays when they had to
6994399 i asked them to dedicate one play each to his memory tonight i think they gave him that whole drive
6994400 the idea at the beginning of that drive was to get about two first downs and change field position with a punt
6994401 coles run was big then ben made a couple big plays for us hes one of our strongest kids he did a great job of stepping up and being a team leader right there
6994402 we knew coming in the questions we had about this team
6994403 i thought we were ok in the second half we relaxed and ran the ball pretty well they just gave us trouble every time they blitzed were a young team and we have to get better the fact is they kicked our butts this year
6994404 you always get better from the first game to the second
6994405 we need to eliminate the penalties but i thought winning the turnover battle was huge for us tonight we have another stiff test coming with orrville but its easier to come in and watch film after a win
6994406 funny i was gonna ask you if you wanted to go thursday
6994407 for the starting group this is the one thats most gamelike
6994408 it just so happened i read the route downfield was able to undercut it and made a play on the ball
6994409 we dont play them in the regular season so this is going to be like a real big game i expect a lot of people to be there
6994410 im here to do my job and thats to win ballgames thats what id like to have been doing the last three years but it hasnt worked out that way to put my energy into thinking about the past and worrying about whats gone on it does me no good and it does the team no good
6994411 he was one of the really good young pitchers that we had when youre hurt youre hurt thats part of life but i hope hes healthy now and can help us win games
6994412 hes excited to be here i think he looks great so im excited about his start
6994413 to me its not that interesting ive lived it ive lived with the frustrations and disappointments of letting myself down and my team down its disheartening but ive been through other adversity in my career surgeries injuries setbacks but you have to keep moving on ive been able to do that throughout my career and i plan on doing it starting saturday
6994414 i guess if you play long enough youre bound to get some milestones
6994415 well wait to see how he does today and then well go from there
6994416 its up to girardi and pitching coach dave eiland how they want to do it they know what theyre doing and the doctors obviously know
6994417 remember when we talked about the prequel movies as if they were the worst movies ever made and really come on they werent that bad well this movie is that bad
6994418 im here for anything to happen if i dont play every day i dont care
6994419 i knew i was going to come back i just didnt know when
6994420 hopefully its over with and i wont have to deal with this type of injury again
6994421 wednesday i hit an old lady and thursday night i left a nice little welt on a guys forehead it wasnt funny but my next at bat i stepped in the batters box and the catcher said hey look at your dugout right now they were all on the top step and they all had helmets on i got a smile out of that
6994422 the biggest thing for me was going out there every day making plays running around being on the bases and really testing my legs out in the outfield there were no setbacks no feelings of dizziness or loopiness or anything like that i just kept progressing every day
6994423 i was pretty frustrated especially when i was pitching pretty well
6994424 free and easy any signs of pain or stiffness would be reasons to shut him down girardi said he expects chamberlain to be forthright if he does feel any pain
6994425 i was pretty frustrated especially when i was pitching pretty well
6994426 wanting to come back for one play to me is obviously the wrong reason to come back
6994427 the only reason i wanted to come back is i wanted to play simple as that
6994428 id like to have that opportunity to make that decision ive been asked that question a lot the answer is i dont know
6994429 i try to keep all the quarterbacks behind me healthy but obviously you want to keep that guy healthy
6994430 they had an excellent pass rush a lot of great players a lot of threats its going to be a competitive game
6994431 any one of those guys couldve been up for the mvp of the super bowl
6994432 they were really good against cleveland and theyve got some really good athletes in the front seven
6994433 we feel like were pretty good up front and its going to be a really good test
6994434 hes been very special i actually wanted to take him out in the sixth inning but he pleaded begged told me hed be ok he said i cant come out of this game i said ok go get em and he went out and got em
6994435 i told manuel that i felt good that i just wanted to stay out there
6994436 i told him i dont want to come out of the game before roy
6994437 to win a game the way we did tonight obviously we have to feel good about it
6994438 it means we won the game today if you play long enough youre bound to hit some milestones
6994439 it was a surprise for them its the first major league game for them it is a beautiful day to make them happy a nice game that we win it couldnt be a better day
6994440 obviously mussinas been our most successful starter and its great to have him out there winning series is of the utmost importance for us
6994441 its consistency its health its talent its work ethic its starting young when i think about derek i think about him getting well beyond 3 000 hits
6994442 the timing of course is simply the timing of when the agreement was completed
6994443 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
6994444 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
6994445 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats
6994446 they like him they want to give him a chance but its a big big job they need some reassurances that hes up to it
6994447 hes not one whos going to shoot from the hip
6994448 i think the personal character is more important than the experience
6994449 its a very complicated job with a lot of pieces that are constantly moving on you
6994450 if the campaign is disorganized and the candidate is disorganized that might be an indication they cant put a white house together
6994451 his experience is certainly not something you would look at and say this is who i want to be leader of the free world

6994458 i dont agree with the one size fits all policy he is a small baby 2 49 kilograms and they give the same dose to babies twice his size i just wanted time to get more information about the vaccine
6994459 itll be something thatll have to be assessed once that child is located
6994460 i am a strong believer in vaccinations being voluntary but not getting this baby vaccinated is a form of child abuse
6994461 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
6994462 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
6994463 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgement and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6994464 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
6994465 youre sensitive but you let people push you around sometimes
6994466 baby i can n0 l0nger live with0ut y0u by my side
6994467 it is imperative that russian forces fully and speedily implement and abide by the commitments that it has made

6994469 je ne continue plus ce qui mattend je lai d j v cu cest plus la peine
6994470 its too late they already got a 3 second score in a game with ten pieces thats 3 3 pieces per second
6994471 hmm i wonder if there is a way to pause the screen while the clock is running so you can plan your steps ahead
6994472 barack has chosen joe biden to be his running mate
6994473 joe biden brings extensive foreign policy experience an impressive record of collaborating across party lines and a direct approach to getting the job done
6994474 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
6994475 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president

6994478 de aanvankelijke veroordeling door de tuchtcommissie voelde alsof ik onschuldig de gevangenis in moest ik heb er slecht van geslapen ben door een hel gegaan de afgelopen drie weken duurden voor mijn gevoel vier jaar
6994479 ik kan me voorstellen dat afellay en van kouwen menen iets dergelijks gehoord te hebben maar dan toch niet uit mijn mond
6994480 maar dat gebeurde niet op vriendelijke wijze h want ik was boos vanwege zijn aanhoudende gezeur waarvoor ik hem even eerder al een gele kaart had gegeven dus ik heb tegen hem gezegd moven hou op schei uit wat ben jij een naar typetje zeg
6994481 die stonden nog dichter bij mij toen ik die woordenwisseling met afellay had dan van kouwen en zij hebben die gewraakte woorden geen van drie n gehoord
6994482 ik heb meteen mijn vrouw op haar werk gebeld die is jarig vandaag en een mooier verjaardagscadeau kon ik haar natuurlijk niet geven daar ging het mij ook om dat ik niet gestraft zou worden voor iets dat ik niet gedaan heb dat het recht zou zegevieren
6994483 understanding singapore solely in terms of its citizen population is an unwarranted sociological fiction
6994484 the timing of course is simply the timing of when the agreement was completed
6994485 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly

6994487 i drive the speed limit and when my 5 000 pound suv comes up on people hindering the flow of traffic i blow them off the road
6994488 i was extremely skeptical how are you going to get people to slow down well you did i did i now drive between 60 and 65 mph and fill up every six to seven days
6994489 they like him they want to give him a chance but its a big big job they need some reassurances that hes up to it
6994490 i think the personal character is more important than the experience
6994491 its a very complicated job with a lot of pieces that are constantly moving on you

6994505 while i do not have any information specifically about pbs in your area we do value programming like this and realize pbs in hd is important to our customers unfortunately due to limits in bandwidth we are not able to offer all of the local channels we provide to the salt lake area in hd i have entered a request for pbs hd to be offered in your area our programming department take channel requests like yours into account when deciding on new programming to offer

6994508 exclusive contracts have been one of the most significant barriers to competition cable prices have risen about 93 percent in the last 10 years this is a way to introduce additional competition which will result in lower prices and greater innovation
6994509 if you are asking if i had an orgasm yes it was a job sir
6994510 i didnt have pleasure doing this i was paid to do it
6994511 you know there there are some things that even i dont know and what michelle is gonna wear is a tightly held secret more tightly held than who my vice presidential choice is gonna be
6994512 the third criteria from me i think was independence i want somebody who is gonna be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a a yes person when it comes to policies
6994513 its a little disappointing i i mean you know john mccain likes to characterize himself as a maverick but the truth is what hes done particularly over the last month when he shook up his campaign is he basically hired karl roves old old crew and adopted karl roves old tactics which really had to do with suggesting that i was unpatriotic
6994514 civilian leaders asif zardari nawaz sharif and prime minister yousaf raza gilani are all less than ideal to become the go to figure for the united states in pakistan
6994515 what is more doubts are growing among american officials over the level of cooperation they can expect from the new army chief ashfaq parvez kayani a former head of intelligence who took over the post from mr musharraf last november
6994516 in my view they wont do aggressive counter insurgency because they cant
6994517 this means they are less likely to cooperate not more

6994520 i think the proliferation of dsls cant be fully avoided but it can be made less painful by defining dsls as specific instantiations of gpls by using meta models
6994521 thats surprising to me id always thought of uml as being more specific about implementation choices than dsls e g the restriction to an object oriented language and the individual classes fields and methods of an implementation specified directly in the models dsm domain specific modeling languages are almost invariably on a higher level of abstraction than uml the only part of uml that is on a high level of abstraction is the use case diagram and thats only at the total loss of precision
6994522 in the coming months you will very likely hear me or others on the team talk about using uml at the
6994523 start with a logical class diagram then transform that into a dsl that is specific to you implementation or domain choice
6994524 the dsls are thus not specific to the problem domain as they should be but to the solution domain they have the implementation concepts of a particular microsoft framework or library
6994525 putting uml before dsls in this way isnt just putting the cart before the horse its putting the horse firmly into the cart and pulling it yourself
6994526 i think the proliferation of dsls cant be fully avoided but it can be made less painful by defining dsls as specific instantiations of gpls by using meta models
6994527 although they are not real meta models the use of stereotypes in uml is a good example of a technique for defining a model language for a specific purpose based on a gpl
6994528 however i dont recommend to use uml as backbone for your language it wont give you an easier life in making your dsl executable a better example is using bpel and bpmn for defining a domain specific process modeling language

6994576 i first got the idea to do the film when i visited the plain of jars in laos in 2002
6994577 you could still see the craters from the air bombing and unexploded ordnance was everywhere
6994578 then i heard about long chen and the fact that no one had got there since the war and i thought how do i visit and how do i make a film about it
6994579 i found it bizarre that at one time this was the second biggest city in laos and it was completely secret
6994580 laos was the progenitor of the way america fights wars in the 21st century
6994581 outsourcing the war to private companies gathering public support by falsifying intelligence and documents embedded journalism and automated warfare including the use of so called smart weapons all these methods were first tested in laos
6994582 the cia had just declassified a whole lot of material so that helped as well
6994583 the most important source was the guys who were over there filming with their little super 8 cameras often illegally
6994584 we destroyed a whole civilisation we wiped it off the map we incinerated atomised human remains in this air war and what happened in the end we lost
6994585 after we went another uk crew tried to get there but they were caught and deported
6994586 there are some places in the world that have a different energy and long chen is one of these you look down the runway and think this is the place were it all happened the planes took off from here and bombed all those people
6994587 its just an army outpost now a small village a couple of hundred people soldiers and their families
6994588 the golden age of long chen is over it used to be the high tech oasis for spooks in laos there were allegedly more antennas there than trees now they do not even have power
6994589 there are still some groups but they are not organised they are certainly not politically or militarily organised they are remnants the children and grandchildren of those involved in the war who are scared to come out of the jungle because they have never known anything else

6994606 the material we play has been to some degree left behind
6994607 it is our ultimate goal to be able to walk away from this with a degree of grace and dignity and be able to look back on our modest career with nothing but fond memories we have no desire to limp along until some outside force has the good sense to put us out of our misery we hope all of our fans will understand

6994616 we are sick of the way things seem to be out of control
6994617 perhaps it takes emblematic events to make us realize that the government is far from living up to its obligations
6994618 but this time there is growing social pressure and it appears to have a focus
6994619 the bottom line is coordination between the states and federal government and maybe this is going to be the catalyzer
6994620 theres enough political concern that theyre going to sit down and figure out a better way to coordinate
6994621 could be effective if there is the political will to do what needs to be done
6994622 i thought our kids were very physical and that makes me proud they really went after it
6994623 i think our kids just really played good physical football
6994624 we are all doing our roles and nobody is trying to do too much
6994625 we are all just doing our part we came together and played good team defense
6994626 whenever a defender got into the backfield they stayed there and didnt run past the running back it was a total team effort
6994627 i thought our defense was very aggressive they played downhill and attacked the ball very well
6994628 they are a nice group of kids who have worked very very hard and they are playing real well together
6994629 kenston did a nice job of keeping us off balance i dont know if we ever really got in synch we made some very nice plays but i never felt we were totally in synch that is one of the things that happens early on in the year
6994630 a lot of the credit for tonights victory has to go to our defensive coordinator george wetzel and the calls he made
6994631 our defense as a whole stepped up to make plays and really put us in position to be successful
6994632 matt is new at the quarterback position but he started varsity for us last year on defense so hes not intimated by the friday night lights
6994633 additionally hes spent a couple of years in the system under former field quarterback nathan clark so he was as ready as he could be to step in tonight
6994634 the biggest thing we need to do is cut down on the turnovers if we want to be successful
6994635 we gave field the ball three times in that first half and they converted them all into scores that really put us in a difficult position
6994636 on a day and night of political suspense delaware sen joe biden emerged as a leading contender to become barack obamas vice presidential pick as two running mate rivals learned they had been eliminated
6994637 i think this is a very conservative estimate on what we can save as far as energy conservation
6994638 i think theres a lot of oil and gas reserves in this area and if we can capitalize on that i think well have service in many ways
6994639 why dont we look at solar besides equipment its pretty much free
6994640 lately ive seen some temporary signs that have gone up that are frankly ugly
6994641 we need to address that and set the community standard that we can all be proud of
6994642 but i think this one especially with the design standards that are being looked at now dovetailing them with some provisions with our current ordinance would be most welcome we have temporary signs that have been up for three or four years

6994648 we used to volunteer with the atwater hot stove and work the concession stand now we can sit back and relax and watch our grandchildren
6994649 they physically whipped us and really controlled the line of scrimmage in that first half
6994650 we came out and played much better in the second half especially in the fourth quarter
6994651 we wanted to come out and get on top of them early and thats what we did
6994652 they were really playing well and we made two costly turnovers they were able to take advantage of
6994653 graves an d czerny both played very good games for us
6994654 id like to get a first round of review on my axfs filesystem

6994669 operations research offers a powerful set of tools that have been used successfully in everything from world war ii to wal mart style logistics planning these tools ought to be used to increase the success of existing programs and to help expand access to hiv care and treatment in resource limited countries
6994670 for example operations research could help with the planning of a national drug distribution system or with predicting the demand for services at local clinics and the best ways to staff them
6994671 to date hiv treatment scale up has appropriately focused first on policy level issues such as program initiation and costs and secondarily on operational level issues now that many programs are in place the potential gains from improved planning are great especially given the high cost of antiretroviral drug therapy
6994672 the analysis suggested that implementation of such a program could allow the government of rwanda to scale up hiv treatment without overburdening its existing health care system
6994673 the unique advantage of operations research is that it gives us the ability to evaluate and optimise outcomes of various scenarios such as determining the best approach for the management of lab equipment repair without impacting patients once we have the evidence for a new approach a good case can be made that it should be implemented as policy although any initiative should take into account the environments in which the projects are to be carried out with all necessary ethical cultural and political considerations
6994674 pour la premi re fois depuis plusieurs ann es on a une croissance nulle dans les services aux entreprises

6994688 they said my services are needed so i go where my services are needed
6994689 nobody from the reds has talked to me about it
6994690 im a second baseman well be getting alex gonzalez back next year and other than omar vizquel juan castro and john mcdonald hes the best shortstop i ever played with
6994691 i dont see the point in me going over there especially with alex gonzalez there
6994692 i dont write the lineup i just play i could play any position if i worked my butt off and put my mind to it when the reds traded for me they told me id be a utility guy and had me working in the outfield i could play any position they want me to do
6994693 im a second baseman man i am a second baseman if it comes to me going over there ill welcome it but im a second baseman
6994694 and id say im about two weeks away from coming back
6994695 i had a good day with jolbert cabrera and adam rosales standing in there for me i dialed it up a little more all in all my ball was live and the swings looked a bit awkward which means i had some deception i only threw fastballs and changeups but thats about all i throw anyway
6994696 i can finally run the way i want to run
6994697 its not like when i get in the game im trying to score a touchdown every play i can run and get a feel for whats going on
6994698 everybody remembers me as a scat back but i went to school at michigan and we run downhill i just never got the opportunity to do that while i was here
6994699 im just waiting my turn when i get it im going to make the most of it all i can say is the best is yet to come
6994700 i played against the guys in practice so it will be fun to compete against them in a different setting
6994701 i talk to guys all the time check on them see how camps treating them
6994702 everybody seems to be doing well i wish those guys the best
6994703 but we got a guy in the deal that has fit in well and made a lot of plays in practice
6994704 nobody wants to talk about it but everyone knows its there
6994705 florian is so football smart hes not the athlete kevin hoyng was hell be the first to tell you that but rob knows the offense knows how to read defenses knows where the ball is supposed to go and is able to put it there the extra quality about him is hes such a leader guys look up to him and thats so important at the quarterback position
6994706 kevin was a great quarterback im not going to try to replace him theres no way i could i dont have his tools
6994707 im not going to just go out there and run around and create my own first down
6994708 im not a huge fan of people pranking me back so i just like to watch and get a good laugh
6994709 his physical abilities are unbelievable he has great leadership he obviously is explosive hes fast hes unbelievably strong he just does his job silently
6994710 we look at it as an opportunity to get better to learn from james
6994711 he said i swear if one more little kid comes up to me and says james can i get your autograph
6994712 when you have such a great linebacker like james its tough to be in that spotlight but at the same time you get an opportunity that a lot of people want to see him play and youre able to showcase your talent
6994713 theres a lot of pros but i dont see too many cons if youre eager for that spotlight then maybe youre not happy but the good thing about us linebackers were not selfish guys
6994714 austin doesnt forget thats the thing it might take him a couple of days a couple of weeks youll hear him complaining but something is going to happen
6994715 anything bad that happens to him he thinks its me
6994716 maybe some times i get him but that was not one of my pranks
6994717 if youre a hard worker and you do the right things i think its bound to happen sometime
6994718 i was getting a facial in the international zone here and i thought id have them do my feet at the same time when i finally got up and looked down i saw it
6994719 i dont think the ladies who did it knew any better so i didnt say anything
6994720 the united states olympic committee gave us a really fancy box to keep it in so i put it right on the stand next to my bed
6994721 ive kept it open so before i go to bed and then again when i wake up its the first thing i see
6994722 she dangled it in front of me but thats it
6994723 everybody floats their boat differently but i just dont understand why anybody would want to do such a thing
6994724 some people after they just had gone through a ban would say man i shouldnt do that again but i guess other people just get so hungry for it they figure its the olympics and they have to do well
6994725 to me if thats what i had to do to compete i wouldnt want to be in the sport and besides all the other reasons i look at my future too i want to have kids some day and that could have a real effect on how they come out
6994726 to see how i was doing and see if i needed anybody to talk to
6994727 she epitomizes the olympic creed especially that last part about the most essential thing being not to have conquered but to have fought well
6994728 i always wanted to see the american flag raised for something ive done and this time i knew id done something to represent my country well
6994729 i read someplace where i was referred to as daytons girl and if thats what they want its fine with me
6994730 got to set a couple of world records first and thats a real big step
6994731 i know bruce hit a home run thursday in chicago but he has been struggling a little bit and im going to take a little of it pressure off him for a while
6994732 votto is swinging good three hits thursday including a home run and thats surprising because he didnt pick up a bat for a week
6994733 i love the 3 spot but we had other guys here ken griffey jr batting third so i said i didnt like it
6994734 it is what it is i just love hitting first second third fourth wherever the manager puts me
6994735 no 3 is a beautiful spot for me because i like being in situations to be the guy i feel like i can be that guy
6994736 we worked on some things this week mechanically i was getting out in front of myself instead of keeping my weight back staying back on the rubber and he worked on some stuff with the timing of my hands it all seemed to work
6994737 i just stayed back and tried to execute my pitches as best i could go right at em instead of nit pick just be aggressive
6994738 most everything was fastballs tonight and i was able to move the ball around the zone and up and down
6994739 he reached back and made some quality pitches at the right time how long has it been since he won a game seven starts i was just glad we got him a win
6994740 man it is never easy in this ballpark the infield is so hard they bounce balls up the middle for hits and the outfield is so big bloopers fall in they wear out your bullpen anything in the gap is a double
6994741 i think ive managed 90 to 95 games over my career in this park and you never feel comfortable ever until the last out no matter what the score you have to keep playing it is different than any other park that ive been in

6994952 we intend to use him in any way possible to help our team
6994953 we know his priority is getting back to full speed at receiver but we also know that as was demonstrated in the scrimmage the other day there is quite a drop off at quarterback if max hall were to go down this gives us a chance to get collies hands on the ball in possibly a few other ways

6995121 troops march down the road and they encounter other troops thats where the battle happens thats what happened at pea ridge

6995166 we know his priority is getting back to full speed at receiver but we also know that as was demonstrated in the scrimmage the other day there is quite a drop off at quarterback if max hall were to go down this gives us a chance to get collies hands on the ball in possibly a few other ways
6995167 but i am going to take the responsibility and try to work with it and get better

6995186 and athletes of west african ancestry definitely have an edge in the sprints and certain other sports in which quick burst running and jumping are key were all born different and were born different by patterns different populations around the world have evolved facing different kinds of environmental and cultural challenges that have shaped how they develop
6995187 genetically based anatomical differences help explain why athletes of primarily west african ancestry hold 97 per cent of top sprint times
6995188 including 494 of the top 500 100 metre times yet are not very good at endurance sports which requires a much different physiology
6995189 the body type of whites falls in between west african descended and east african athletes they have more natural upper body strength which contributes to their domination of weightlifting field events such as the shot put and hammer whites hold 46 of the top 50 throws and the offensive line in football where flexibility is key east asians shine such as in diving and some skating and gymnastic events
6995190 fast men have a special component called actinen a in their fast twitch muscles which determine whether humans are sprinters or plodders
6995191 theres a lot of serendipity pure luck at work here with the confluence of so many jamaican runners sprinters right now at future olympics youre going to see runners distributed through people of west african ancestry distributed through different populations whether its other caribbean communities or the u s or canada france britain whatever again its serendipity you see such a high concentration of jamaicans
6995192 athletic competition offers a definitiveness that eludes most other aspects of life
6995193 this is of course dangerous territory fascination about black physicality and black anger about being caricatured as a lesser human being have been part of the dark side of the american dialogue on race for more than a century
6995194 the actn3 centred argument dismisses the importance of jamaicas impressive investment in the infrastructure and training system required to identify and nurture elite track athletes the effects of a culture that idolizes local track heroes and the powerful desire of young jamaicans to use athletic success to lift themselves and their families out of poverty
6995195 we needed red twitch fibres 100 000 years ago to give us the ability to walk long long distances from one berry area to another one
6995196 and we also needed the fast twitch fibres because you either had to run away from an animal or get after it to catch it
6995197 you find white guys with lots of fast twitch fibres and youll find also white guys who can run a long time
6995198 yes you need the talent no doubt about it body size muscle fibre composition and such things

6995207 its more interested in slogans and spin and is arrogant and out of touch with victorians
6995208 the shame of this is the government had the opportunity to shelter victoria from the downturn and didnt
6995209 we engaged campaigned and met our objectives john brumby ignored kororoit and made it into a vicious nasty campaign
6995210 the party futures committee has come to the conclusion that the party will not succeed in substantially lifting its membership involving other supporters or strengthening its organisation unless it becomes more attractive and accessible
6995211 there are still huge arguments in germany about whether certain buildings can ever be neutralized and be seen as works of architecture on their own merit
6995212 with the nazis its the only clear cut case where we can say this is not a work of art its a work of propaganda
6995213 and that has to do with how we feel about the nazis not about the work of art its a complete projection
6995214 he really took us to task for our work in china
6995215 our response was well in your scenario nobody should participate until the entire system is reformed in our view in the meantime if we could provide a building that improves the prospects for public life how can that be a bad thing to do
6995216 w e do not wish to over emphasize our role but the stadium is perhaps a component of this path or at least a small stone
6995217 i n a profession long given to grand ambitions for remaking the world the most adventurous architects dont merely want to work they want to change the world
6995218 the grotesque extent to which i clung to this illusion
6995219 nobody today is saying gee wouldnt it have been great if alexander had commissioned public housing projects
6995220 we wishfully separate artists from their patrons at a certain juncture so we can see the work as art without being fettered by our conscience regarding the regimes that built them
6995221 i watched the guys warm up and its hot out there
6995222 i just sat there with my cooling vest on listening to music and just chilled out i think that really paid off
6995223 the majority are using it to block out everything else thats going on around them
6995224 essentially what theyre doing is really not thinking at all theyre just listening to music and being in a space before they actually get ready to narrow their focus
6995225 kevin drew and broken social scene brendan canning those guys jason collett all the guys from broken social scene thats my favourite band probably
6995226 im very electronic techno house music really gets me going
6995227 to start warming up its very helpful it gives me a lot of energy and gets me pumped heading into the warm up and into the meet
6995228 they have underperformed the likes of which we probably have never seen from a u s track and field team
6995229 i knew they would win i knew they would get the world record
6995230 clearly already this team has outperformed athens our various teams in the gold medal competitions are assured
6995231 all in the citizens of the united states of america even the rest of the world can be proud of the participation of the u s and our team here
6995232 quite frankly the way were going right now were going to have to reassess what our goals and objectives are for london 2012 because theres a good chance we could achieve our london objective here
6995233 our objective for london was top 12 but i think were sitting near that right now in overall medals
6995234 a lot of good things attitudinally are happening here too
6995235 i dont know if everybody feels this way but im watching events and im saying whoa we just missed the gold where we used to say darn it were fourth we missed getting a medal now were starting to think gold
6995236 i dont want to be like the toronto maple leafs where every time they have a bad year they just shuffle the deck a little bit and hope they get dealt some good cards the next year
6995237 were not doing that we have a vision of where we want to go and were going to continue to build on that
6995238 we didnt have a lot of extra money this time so alex baumann and the road to excellence program used it where they thought it would have the biggest impact
6995239 one thing we worked on was a high tech environmental box for our triathletes to train in
6995240 all i can say is jamaicans sprinters are taking over the world said bolt who ran the third leg around the turn and extended a nice lead into a laugher before he handed off to powell
6995241 weve always been the sprinters but were going to tell the world were taking over forever forever
6995242 i asked the guys to give it to me and they came through bolt said
6995243 we just went out there had fun and ran fast
6995244 we were way too tight we were too conservative we went out there with an air of caution and we shouldnt have
6995245 i did what i was supposed to do she did what she was supposed to do
6995246 cijfers over het aantal passagiers dat mogelijk de dupe wordt van de acties lopen uiteen de vnv heeft het over circa 24 000 reizigers op zeventig vluchten transavia houdt het op zon 10 000 op veertig vluchten
6995247 beijing will be unique and london will set the standard for a more modest future olympics and i think it is important for the ioc to establish that standard because otherwise it is potentially narrowing the field of candidates who can stage a games
6995248 the biggest worry now is that as the budget strains the legacy will suffer
6995249 the whole idea of london 2012 was not about two weeks of sport it was about the legacy of taking a desolate swath of east london and transforming it a legacy of complete regeneration was the priority now that is in trouble
6995250 i have fought him twice and i won once and lost once
6995251 this time i am fighting him at home i will win i will win the gold medal
6995252 what strokes can you do just the doggie paddle jump in and see if you can make it to the other side way to go okay now who wants to be vice captain what you can do the backstroke breaststroke and the crawl sorry theres no place for show offs on this team
6995253 two months ago there was a rumour that there may be a group of people aiming to manipulate the results of events
6995254 hard work and commitment and confidence in yourself and what you believe i think everybody knows its following that little voice inside of you and believing in that we all have potential to bring it out we just have to believe in ourselves
6995255 there are times at night usually youre going to bed and you feel lonely and youre wishing its all over
6995256 im not going to lie this past week ive wanted this to be over ive loved every minute of it but at the same time all right this is a long season i feel my little tired body is tired and wants to stop
6995257 i learned how to win and be comfortable to be fast believe in myself and not be afraid to actually go for it
6995258 his coach michael creamer and he have this understanding and mutual respect
6995259 i think michael knows how to settle him down keep him focused plus hes a technical wizard
6995260 i think that gave tom the confidence and the knowledge to learn about what hes all about and its endurance and thats what we saw today he knows that now he always was that but he didnt know it
6995261 i think itll take a while to sink in just like the fact that i made it here took a while to sink in
6995262 it took me i dont know how long to realize i was actually coming here i think when i got here i finally realized it this is a whole new level i think itll sink in eventually i dont think ill sleep tonight its pretty crazy pretty crazy
6995263 i feel like the weight of the one ring is now off my shoulders maybe
6995264 im going home and getting something to eat and then straight to bed
6995265 ive been telling people im in the best shape of my life
6995266 i came here for experience and i learned a lot so its good on that side just how to compete with these guys and hold my energy during the times when youre down and you need to get back up
6995267 things could have gone better but im happy and very proud of my first olympics charles said
6995268 watch out 2012 it will be a whole different story
6995269 i have been struggling with injuries said metcalfe whose time of 17 07 82 was well off the winners pace
6995270 going to the olympics sounded like it was an impossible thing to do
6995271 i just sucked it up excuse my expression but thats what i did
6995272 you have to hide everything and give it everything you cant just stop because you broke something
6995273 i was looking at the flag from the medal podium and i was like hopefully next time the maple leaf will be in the middle and ill have that medal i want
6995274 i just didnt want to cry on the podium i just wanted to look at the flag and suck it up
6995275 i did three world championships and the first two i didnt get the medal i wanted and then finally i got that medal
6995276 so im convinced that i can do the same thing in four years
6995277 a lot of my family members my boyfriend they wanted to come i asked them not to that i prefer they kept the money they watched me at home everybody was all together in one room and that was really special
6995278 when i want something i usually get it so im disappointed because i wanted my gold medal and its not because i couldnt get it it was right there its a question of a little bit more training and seeing next time
6995279 he was favoured to win all of canada are waiting for him to win theres not too many gold medals for canada already i think the pressure was enormous on him
6995280 i think its hard for people who arent athletes to imagine how the pressure is i think thats what happened because he is stronger than he showed here
6995281 i put a lot of pressure on myself every time i line up though im always very nervous i was very nervous today i did everything i could i prepared well ive raced well all season i have no explanation for this
6995282 all i have is an apology im sorry i hate watching people apologize after bad performances but i know why now they do it because there was a lot of pressure on me and that pressure amounted to expectations of people back home and i always talk about how great performances by canadians athletes can be inspiring and motivating i didnt contribute to that at all today
6995283 the thing is hes so strong and he handles it so well that people just keep putting more and more on him
6995284 sometimes you dont realize that someone may feel it when they act like they dont
6995285 i dont know i do this every day i do this well every day im not bragging im not boasting im not trying to talk myself up i do this well every day i train with the best in the world every time i race every time i line up im a contender and today i simply was not even close
6995286 pressure because we came here looking for a gold medal and we are so close excitement because we have been preparing for four years to get to this point
6995287 not that we played bad tonight but weve still got to be better
6995288 he gives it his all and when you see a guy playing like that on defence you cant slack down
6995289 you feel like youre letting him down because if one guys going like that and you just let your guy catch the ball in a position where they can damage you you feel like you let your team down and that person down because hes hustling for no reason
6995290 hes taken his game to another level i think hes been a real man for us and were going to need him again on sunday
6995291 i know what my responsibilities are on the offensive and defensive ends so when i get in theres really no thinking about it i just do what im supposed to do and i guess im doing the right thing because im still playing
6995292 sometimes if i dont know guys it takes me a while to warm up to them
6995293 the doctor told us it is best that he doesnt play we will observe the situation for the next game but he couldnt play today he wasnt ready to play because of his medical condition
6995294 people have been emailing me and texting me that same thing but theyre still a good team without jose i just want him to be healthy
6995295 those groins are tough i had it last year and theyre no joke
6995296 only a few people get to play an olympic final and it doesnt matter if im 17 or 28
6995297 was i completely out of it the whole way was i like hypnotized for 3 1 2 minutes thats what it felt like
6995298 ill just look back and respect the fact that ive got it in me
6995299 i know ive done it before i know ive done that a hell of a lot more often than what i just did now
6995300 people started just blowing past me and i couldnt handle it
6995301 the feeling of getting passed by six guys that i never lose to was devastating
6995302 weve been sort of joking that we got a bronze in the triples event and not the pairs because kolo was paddling with us
6995303 in my opinion each one of them would want to be there and will be there that president will want to demonstrate to the world that the u s represented by chicago wants to welcome the world back to the united states
6995304 of course he will be there and we can enjoy his support

6995308 she didnt win i won and thats it the judges can take your dreams away
6995309 the judges have to press their buttons for the score and my colour obviously wasnt working
6995310 my foot hit her face and i felt it so it was definitely a head shot
6995311 i was absolutely in my zone i made one mistake and she caught me
6995312 ive just got to keep my head up and go for the bronze which is not what i came here for i wanted to come here with no regrets and ive done that but the judges can take your dreams away
6995313 not so much interested in ensuring fair treatment of employees and the like as they are in redefining the very concept of kashrut
6995314 i have no firsthand knowledge of what went on before
6995315 but if you take away preraid youve got to say its a wonderful situation now
6995316 we are suspecting some more militant are hiding in the area the operation still continues
6995317 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6995318 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6995319 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6995320 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6995321 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6995322 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6995323 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6995324 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6995325 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6995326 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6995327 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6995328 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6995329 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6995330 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6995331 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6995332 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6995333 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6995334 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6995335 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6995336 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6995337 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6995338 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6995339 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6995340 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6995341 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6995342 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6995343 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6995344 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6995345 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6995346 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6995347 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6995348 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6995349 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6995350 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6995351 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6995352 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6995353 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6995354 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6995355 who are open to doing something on the production side
6995356 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6995357 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6995358 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

6995364 our biggest question going into the game was how was our defense
6995365 we had some young line backers in there we had some starters that were hurt and they were able to step in and we were pleased with that
6995366 we were able to do a little bit more early on this year i dont think we lost a beat
6995367 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6995368 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6995369 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6995370 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6995371 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6995372 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6995373 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6995374 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6995375 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6995376 if they choose not to access any of the options available to them under the process then the statutory director has told them what his decision is
6995377 obviously what we would look at is who are the people involved in that site application but i dont want to speculate too much on what they would do and how they would do it
6995378 wasnt the cause of their deaths although it may have contributed to it
6995379 we are treating the problem very seriously because it is a serious infection
6995380 because he had other conditions it absolutely played a role
6995381 it may be a week or more before we get the molecular fingerprinting
6995382 this is the time when there is a lot of hypothesis
6995383 theres no direct link to any of the recalled meat products
6995384 i dont think we had enough force there to impose order
6995385 the aftermath turned out to be much more difficult than anyone had anticipated
6995386 i made the case to general tommy franks to defense secretary donald rumsfeld and to the president that i was not sure we had enough troops
6995387 i dont remember specifically what secretary powell may be referring to but im quite certain that there were lots of discussions about how best to fulfill the mission when we went into iraq
6995388 potentially a lot of problems with a very very big footprint of coalition forces at the time of the liberation of iraq
6995389 im quite certain that there are things that in retrospect we would do differently but thats the nature of any big complicated operation
6995390 we really do want it to be based on conditions on the ground so do the iraqis if there is anything that they recognize its that they are not quite ready for these tasks but they want to take that responsibility and we should want them to take it
6995391 i left the country convinced that russias invasion of georgia may be the one of the most significant event to occur in europe since the end of communism
6995392 when congress reconvenes i intend to work with the administration to seek congressional approval for 1 billion in emergency assistance for georgia with a substantial down payment on that aid to be included in the congress next supplemental spending bill
6995393 help the people of georgia to rebuild their country and preserve its democratic institutions
6995394 five and a half years in the big leagues and its nice to finally get back here
6995395 its a little bit different with the boston red sox jersey on thats for sure and coming in with playoff implications and all the stuff that comes with it its nice to be home per se but itd be even nicer to win these games
6995396 my arm felt probably the best its felt all year
6995397 theyve been getting good pitching all year and theyre hitting the ball now
6995398 i think theyre a lot better than their record and even their records not that bad
6995399 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6995400 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6995401 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6995402 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6995403 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6995404 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6995405 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6995406 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6995407 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6995408 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6995409 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6995410 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6995411 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6995412 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6995413 its very important to create a gap ahead if you want a clear lap you cant see ahead around the corners because theyre all blind
6995414 some drivers just back up into you they take advantage of the fact they have a small gap behind them and dont care about whos following
6995415 el problema a su juicio es que la asociaci n nazca con fortaleza y que haya apoyos suficientes y que esos apoyos se sigan manteniendo porque puede pasar que cuando nos vayamos con los cad veres de nuestros familiares nos olvidemos de la asociaci n
6995416 en caliente ha habido insultos entre partes y llegar a un acuerdo sobre una cosa de este tipo pele ndonos no es un buen augurio
6995417 ya habr tiempo para depurar responsabilidades y aclarar otras cuestiones
6995418 en estos momentos los familiares de las v ctimas no quieren saber de dinero porque ahora no es la prioridad en absoluto
6995419 si nos mencionan el dinero cuando todav a no tenemos los cuerpos de nuestros familiares nos est n convirtiendo en mercantilistas y lo sentimos como una especie de ofensa personal
6995420 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6995421 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6995422 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6995423 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6995424 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6995425 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6995426 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6995427 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6995428 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6995429 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6995430 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6995431 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6995432 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6995433 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6995434 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6995435 were trying to identify in the trichoplax genes that are also found in other animals our genome and the fruit fly genome and so on
6995436 a big effort and a big investment and so we have to choose carefully
6995437 the motivation for choosing this animal was its phylogenetic position
6995438 a tiny little pancake of cells you can barely see without a microscope
6995439 and theyre extremely simple about as simple as you can be just a disc of cells thats two layers thick
6995440 well thats one of the main questions im going after now that im setting up my own lab
6995441 is there a reason theyre together and if they get separated by a mutation does that disrupt some mechanism of gene regulation or cause some other problem for an organism
6995442 but its a very clear question and ive decided to try to find the answer to that
6995443 the sight of a feather in a peacocks tail whenever i gaze at it makes me sick
6995444 how can this trait be made in one gender and not the other
6995445 males and females basically have the same set of genes so how do you specifically modify the activity of a males genes but not a females genes
6995446 the flies did not need new genes to make a new pattern
6995447 they just changed how males and females use a common set of genes
6995448 the switch existed for tens of millions of years because it had a different job
6995449 but it got remodeled evolution is a cumulative process you have this machinery and its easy to add a bell or a whistle with this particular trait it evolved by exploiting genetic information that was already there to make male bodies different from female bodies
6995450 we have enough evidence to believe this evolved in a male specific way
6995451 if female tastes change these traits go away there is no reinforcement
6995452 as long as the gain outweighs the cost the feature will survive the fruit flys color pattern is a paradigm for understanding how to use the same sets of genes in different sexes to come up with different features
6995453 the ability to comprehensively sequence any persons genome is the type of quantum leap needed to usher in an age of personalized medicine where healthcare providers can use an individuals genetic code to prevent diagnose and treat diseases
6995454 a new generation of sequencing technologies is stepping in front of the already impressive technologies that enabled initial sequencing of the human genome
6995455 we continue to seek further innovation to enable routine sequencing of genomes to advance scientific knowledge and healthcare

6995467 along with all the things that parents know are important for helping keep their kids healthy like washing hands and getting enough sleep flu vaccination should be right up there but this survey shows us that we still have a lot of educating to do
6995468 as a community we need to do a better job spreading the word about how important a yearly flu vaccine can be in helping protect kids and ourselves from influenza

6995482 has anyone looked at using busybox and uclibc with asterisk those two and agressively stripping everything were the biggest things in making linux tiny that and eliminating static binaries whereever possible
6995483 ive run a uclibc linked asterisk in a chroot environment for some months now and i have to say it works it isnt stress tested but it seems to work the binary is 546 kb and all 90 modules take up 2364 kb together
6995484 i am running asterisk on a modified suse 9 0 rescue system total system including sshd asterisk moh and asterisk prompts is 32 mb zipped it expands to 52 mb on a 64 mb ram disk i boot it from a compact flash disk the system is a 600 mhz transmeta crusoe with only 110 mb ram it is powerful enough to drive a quadbri and so some gsm encoding decoding

6995491 even with the additional conditions and restrictions that were proposed an india specific exemption from nsg rules would be a serious mistake that would blow a hole in the nuclear nonproliferation system
6995492 at this point we can expect that washington and new delhi will try to wordsmith the proposals to restrict and condition nuclear trade with india to the point of being meaningless and force a decision at the next nsg meeting
6995493 in response responsible nsg states should insist on guidelines relating to india that are clear and unambiguous and given that the nsg participant states actions on this issue will have an impact for decades to come they should not rush to judgement

6995499 talks will continue and we hope that some positive results will come out
6995500 we discussed the core issue and it is not proper now to divulge what we discussed in the meeting
6995501 we discussed and exchanged views in a cordial atmosphere and agreed to meet again

6995512 the lads who ensure that theres a conveyor belt of talent coming through theyre the unsung heroes who have done so much for irish boxing at the olympics
6995513 that day is already fixed but now an effort is being made to resolve the issue through talks

6995528 this issue is as important or more important to the latino community than the presidential race
6995529 its a real core value for latinos theres no question about that
6995530 for those who vote which is a subset of the latino community youre likely to find support for the proposition opposing gay marriage but those sorts of moral issues do not motivate latinos to participate
6995531 i just dont know if the number of latino voters will be enough to put it the gay marriage ban over the top
6995532 the extent to which the republican party cares about their issues beyond just abortion and gay marriage
6995533 its the same core message that traditional marriage is the cornerstone of our society
6995534 the california supreme court chose to look at it strictly as a legal contract between party a and party b that is not just myopic its potentially devastating to families and society
6995535 i think its because everyone is so culturally catholic who is latino
6995536 i think thats one thing that kind of permeates every latino society
6995537 i think its the way we were raised its so catholic and there are set rules the way things are supposed to be
6995538 but i wouldnt say i agree with it just because of how i was raised
6995539 we know that he had extended contact with the girl whos now 16
6995540 our concern is there may be additional victims because he clearly has no qualms about contacting girls who are significantly underage
6995541 i completed my two year contract and i feel like i accomplished what i set out to do
6995542 we value and appreciate the vision bob has put in place for montalvo
6995543 he has helped us broaden our artistic programs by integrating contemporary art throughout the organization
6995544 i hope you are not back again in this situation
6995545 i am concerned that before too long hes going to be out on the street again
6995546 hopefully he uses his intelligence and charm to go into a different direction

6995550 projects like semitropic are part of an absolute explosion in new water storage that weve seen in the last 15 years
6995551 we have all this water in wet years that we cant use
6995552 the important thing for us is how can we level it out and have a water supply that will be available for us in dry years we had to find some place to put it so we could use it later
6995553 its a good value and i feel really good about where we are
6995554 in places like kern county where they have been doing this for years they have worked out agreements with their neighbors as to how fast theyll draw water out
6995555 they are pretty sophisticated but in other areas these concerns still have to be solved
6995556 i drive the speed limit and when my 5 000 pound suv comes up on people hindering the flow of traffic i blow them off the road

6995642 yeah for the most part the kids are working really hard im disappointed that we are really down as far as the seniors go we only have six that was how many juniors we had last year so we got back the players i was expecting i was just hoping with us winning we could pick up some older kids but i am real happy with the kids we do have i think we had 44 kids who made 85 percent of the summer workouts we lift as a team at 6 in the morning that is a pretty impressive percentage with only 54 players in our program
6995643 just consistency throughout the program again i am disappointed that not more kids in the senior class came out its hard to win with six seniors but we have good numbers in our junior and sophomore classes
6995644 we went to camp at appalachian state we were there for four days and they had three sessions a day up there the kids had a good experience up there the camp is important for uniting the team and the thing i like is it is football 24 hours a day i think it gets them ready for the fall our kids got a lot of good fundamental skills
6995645 micha howard at running back he had a big year for us at fullback last year this year we are moving him back to tailback jordan ozerities at receiver anthony harley at wide receiver and defensive end paul perez at linebacker all have to have good seasons
6995646 you always want to play a full schedule now we are talking about trying to pick up a game on our open date oct 24 and we may end up playing a 5a school possibly new smyrna beach if we do that means we will be playing 10 weeks in a row plus the potters house game was supposed to be a home game if we pick up new smyrna beach that will be an away game so we lose that gate
6995647 i think it helps our mind set going into the season when i got here a year ago it was not a real good mind set but even though we have those returning players we still lost a lot of key components we lost 1 600 yards and 15 touchdowns from qb alex hudak a good running back in courtney steadman and cody stanaland our middle linebacker who had over 150 tackles last year
6995648 micha howard has a bunch of schools that came through here in the spring who were interested in him jordan ozerities is only a junior but he is going to get a lot of attention the thing that is going to help him is that he is a solid a b student
6995649 we will have a better kicking game this year with hector tijerina from the soccer team that will help we were 7 3 in the regular season and one of the games we lost to crystal river we missed four extra points and a field goal i always like to have a kicker
6995650 just the fact that they have been there they know what they can do our big goal this year is to host a playoff game which means we have to win our district that is a big goal with south sumter in our district but i really believe in setting goals it will be more difficult this year last year we snuck up on a lot of people this year we will have a target on our backs

6995701 around 350 metres i felt i was still fourth and the whole thing i tell myself every time is go harder
6995702 those are my key words i felt i could reel the uzbeki guy in around 100 metres i knew with about 100 metres left i had him ive raced against him before and i know the strategy he uses he used the same here
6995703 we know he is with us he is in heaven but we know hes holding our hands
6995704 we knew hed have to pull something off in the last 200 metres
6995705 he got off to the line in the first 100 pretty good but usually you see the bigger guys pull ahead a little up to 250
6995706 he was sitting nicely beside menkov for most of the race and i think when the two others slipped by menkov it broke his spirit a bit
6995707 i knew i could do it but i never knew it would happen i believed in myself but then thats something that everybody in this level does

6995734 we aim to provide that discerning group of travelers with something which is instantly recognizable and appreciated we define style as being authentic detailed seamless textured unpretentious and natural with a personality that exudes innate individuality and the old bangkok inn fulfills and surpasses each of these qualities
6995735 if you like a hotel to be more like a home then youll love the old bangkok inn
6995736 steering guests away from gas guzzling taxis and toward alternative forms of transport is just one way the old bangkok inn is actively distinguishing itself as an urban green hotel one of the increasing number of places that are adopting that strategy

6995741 das vorgehen russlands war weder legitim noch verh ltnism ig
6995742 auf die unkluge georgische milit roperation wurde v llig berzogen reagiert
6995743 russland hat die territoriale integrit t und souver nit t eines anderen landes mit milit rischer gewalt verletzt das ist ein gravierender vorgang
6995744 es ist mehr als rufsch digung russland hat seinem bild in der welt als berechenbarer zukunftspartner massiv geschadet
6995745 wir wollen im kaukasus nicht wieder erleben was wir am balkan erlebt haben sowohl der balkan als auch der kaukasus d rfen nicht zu globalen konflikten werden

6995747 wir werden gro e aufmerksamkeit auch auf andere l nder richten m ssen die gro e russischsprechende oder ethnisch russische bev lkerungsteile haben damit ist in erster linie aber nicht nur die ukraine gemeint
6995748 unsere stimme viel zu wenig erhoben gegen das bisherige russische vorgehen in abchasien und in s dossetien da wurde versucht russische staatsb rger durch das verteilen von russischen reisep ssen zu produzieren politisch ist das u erst beunruhigend
6995749 he was a sweet good boy very outgoing caring and everybody loved him
6995750 he brought a frog and a gecko home and his dad told him hed have to feed them or let them go
6995751 if students feel the need to talk to someone well have extra counselors on staff monday and the school will have a representative at the funeral
6995752 you should have seen all the people and kids that came by thursday
6995753 the community has poured out their heart and we appreciate it
6995754 she said she was so sorry she couldnt stop when he went in front of her we feel sorry for her she must be traumatized too
6995755 obviously one of the issues about any self diagnosis is what happens with the results
6995756 we want people to take more responsibility for their own health
6995757 we consider that ossetia should have the power it prefers georgian intrusion into affairs of ossetia would be an unjustified intervention into foreign internal affairs

6995763 some happy news well i can now announce that tom and i are expecting a baby and we are very happy
6995764 as im sure youll understand we needed time to wait for results and tell our families thank you for all your kindness good wishes and support even if it was based on speculation
6995765 i will be taking it easy but am also excited to start writing for the fifth album ill need some time off to be a mum but before you know it ill be back
6995766 celebrities like lindsay lohan are merely gay for play and are attempting to cash in on the faddish appeal of lesbianism without any commitment to our cause
6995767 they never seem to move past the hand holding and eye gazing phase of the relationship
6995768 theres no sense these two are actually in a commited relationship if lindsay would come out and say shes gay and in a commited relationship with ronson then maybe she could use her media clout for good for the first time in her life
6995769 i kissed a girl was inspired when i opened up a magazine and i saw a picture of scarlett johansson
6995770 i was with my boyfriend at the time and i said to him im not going to lie if scarlett johansson walked into the room and wanted to make out with me i would make out with her
6995771 i hate the song it clearly promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting katy knows how i feel we are a very outspoken family and she knows how disappointed her father and i are i cant even listen to that song the first time i heard it i was in total shock when it comes on the radio i bow my head and pray
6995772 so many of my friends have had them and theyve gone wrong
6995773 had one that sort of moved up to her shoulder
6995774 if i got saggy like the sacks some women have after they have children id have them done im not against them
6995775 i was never anorexic so i was never that skinny
6995776 when i was 15 i was like oh no i dont want to be different
6995777 im looking forward to facing somebody other than joe inglett leading off the game
6995778 ill be excited that maybe lyle overbay wont in the lineup and recognize everything that comes out of my hand
6995779 weve had nights just like this where weve come in here and im explaining why we lost or how we lost and we found a way tonight to turn it around and have a good win
6995780 we did a good job the bottom of the lineup today found ways to get on base and set the table for the top of the lineup
6995781 this team has always won with good starting pitching had a good starting outing and we allowed us to get some runs across
6995782 my cut fastball would sink run back over the plate like it did to overbay then it would cut the next time out i think it was just a little windy i was just having trouble having a feel for the ball so i was wild it was like boy scouts survival just trying to make do with what i had
6995783 just real excited to be a part of this team
6995784 they play great defense they hit the ball im having a really good time ive pitched better but im going to take the win and move on
6995785 la actividad delictiva de este acusado resulta tan angurrienta que no solo utilizaba el dinero p blico para sus gastos personales sino que todos los d as dispon a de ese dinero para su alimentaci n
6995786 i was frustrated i didnt have control of my bat head sometimes im just my own worst enemy
6995787 still my main job is to get the pitchers ready
6995788 talked about the disk thats been there for a long time its just spasming around it the muscles are spasming so when we calm that down hell be ok i think we thought he was calmed down to the point yesterday where he was going to play then it spasmed up again just got to get it to calm down
6995789 this is just a thing ive been dealing with a couple times this year so far
6995790 now it didnt seem to be as bad when i did it on sunday for whatever reason my backs really guarding against letting that spasm out its kind of tough because i sit down get relaxed try to stand up and im stiff its hard to get loose
6995791 once i get moving in a certain direction kind of walking im ok get up and get upright but if i sit down or bend over and try to move its locked up
6995792 continually try to treat it see if we can get it calmed down try to break the spasm fix the pain get ready to go
6995793 it could be better today it could be better sunday all along thats kind of how its went when i was in japan i hurt for a couple days then kind of the spasm went away and i felt better i thought i was heading in the right direction thursday because it felt better then today its guarding again really stiff so well see if we can get it calmed down and kind of get back to baseball activities without having to go on the dl
6995794 he was very efficient obviously throwing that fastball to lefties that comes back for a strike
6995795 but youre not going to see him out there running around catching grounders today its definitely a setback how far of a setback well see
6995796 weve shown we can lay on fantastic sporting events britain has invented or codified virtually every major sport
6995797 i think it would be wonderful for london if we held the rugby world cup in 2015
6995798 we have a city where people speak 300 languages we have unbelievable tourist facilities and its now europes number one tourist destination
6995799 do everything in our power to bring the world cup to england in 2015
6995800 increasingly the potential for innovative thought and new medical therapies is jeopardized by threats aimed at researchers and their families
6995801 we need to send a message that violence or serious threats of violence are never the answer
6995802 i definitely want to get something bad on the road it must be big enough for all my friends and to scare all the cars away from me im a good driver but its everyone else that im worried about
6995803 we are very confident that hes the individual that savagely sexually assaulted this woman over the weekend
6995804 this would not have been solved if it werent for the poise of the victim the perseverance of the community providing us with tips and the investigative work of the investigative team
6995805 if tatas want they can set up operations in maharashtra we shall offer them all facilities including land anywhere they require pune nashik aurangabad or any other place of their choice
6995806 what he wanted was when you looked at a painting of his you always saw something else as well
6995807 we know that he had extended contact with the girl whos now 16
6995808 our concern is there may be additional victims because he clearly has no qualms about contacting girls who are significantly underage
6995809 shes called us mom and dad since she was eight years old
6995810 as a party responsible for these kids we do not find ourselves in position to let them go here anymore
6995811 if tatas want they can set up operations in maharashtra we shall offer them all facilities including land anywhere they require pune nashik aurangabad or any other place of their choice
6995812 we have exchanged constructive views with each other and will meet again
6995813 would likely murder men simply because they appeared to be latino or african american
6995814 when a city is violating federal law and that violation of law leads to horrific consequences like this then the city has clearly acted in a negligent manner
6995815 she expects everything to be done for her why run when you can walk
6995816 so many factors had to come together for her to win
6995817 i drive the speed limit and when my 5 000 pound suv comes up on people hindering the flow of traffic i blow them off the road
6995818 i was extremely skeptical how are you going to get people to slow down well you did i did i now drive between 60 and 65 mph and fill up every six to seven days
6995819 we wanted to create a unique experience that touched peoples emotions
6995820 if you can get people interested early on you may turn some on to a path of learning about biology or conservation
6995821 you cant have your own pipes crossing the delta with water that used to flow through the delta and claim it has no effect
6995822 the california department of fish and game and the state water resources control board charged with implementing laws in these areas were under resourced and frequently marginalized in water policy making
6995823 it will be not just a blueprint it will be a plan of action that can be adopted immediately which is a good thing
6995824 i completed my two year contract and i feel like i accomplished what i set out to do
6995825 we value and appreciate the vision bob has put in place for montalvo
6995826 he has helped us broaden our artistic programs by integrating contemporary art throughout the organization
6995827 she sets an example the rest of us try to live up to
6995828 she elevated the quality of life of these dogs above the safety of their neighbors
6995829 i think that i am responsible for some conduct that has caused damage to the system to my office
6995830 i hope ive conveyed to the court that i feel badly
6995831 if there is a silver lining it is that ive become a better lawyer
6995832 i think a lot of stuff caught up with him
6995833 obviously one of the issues about any self diagnosis is what happens with the results
6995834 we want people to take more responsibility for their own health
6995835 i hope you are not back again in this situation
6995836 i am concerned that before too long hes going to be out on the street again
6995837 hopefully he uses his intelligence and charm to go into a different direction
6995838 its like any bank you put money in then take it out when you need it
6995839 projects like semitropic are part of an absolute explosion in new water storage that weve seen in the last 15 years
6995840 we have all this water in wet years that we cant use
6995841 the important thing for us is how can we level it out and have a water supply that will be available for us in dry years we had to find some place to put it so we could use it later
6995842 its a good value and i feel really good about where we are
6995843 in places like kern county where they have been doing this for years they have worked out agreements with their neighbors as to how fast theyll draw water out
6995844 they are pretty sophisticated but in other areas these concerns still have to be solved
6995845 weve been through a lot and sweated out a lot of close calls
6995846 new york city is going to make money by being green
6995847 and thats the message we want to send to the private sector as well you can have it both ways
6995848 similar to a large car or a larger ship the ride is just more stable and more enjoyable
6995849 there is nothing more valuable in life than an education except of course money or a nice car
6995850 i teach math to eighth grade students this is an unnecessary task because they are all going to be professional basketball players professional nascar racecar drivers professional bass fisher people or marine biologists who will never need to actually use math
6995851 brylcreem a little dabll do ya brylcreem youll look so debonair but watch out the galsll all pursue ya theyll love to get their fingers in your hair
6995852 but with the advent of the fact checking obsessed blogosphere
6995853 only if they have to check facts presented by someone they genuinely dislike and only in the 5 minutes when the subject is hot
6995854 this issue is as important or more important to the latino community than the presidential race
6995855 its a real core value for latinos theres no question about that
6995856 for those who vote which is a subset of the latino community youre likely to find support for the proposition opposing gay marriage but those sorts of moral issues do not motivate latinos to participate
6995857 i just dont know if the number of latino voters will be enough to put it the gay marriage ban over the top
6995858 the extent to which the republican party cares about their issues beyond just abortion and gay marriage
6995859 its the same core message that traditional marriage is the cornerstone of our society
6995860 the california supreme court chose to look at it strictly as a legal contract between party a and party b that is not just myopic its potentially devastating to families and society
6995861 i think its because everyone is so culturally catholic who is latino
6995862 i think thats one thing that kind of permeates every latino society
6995863 i think its the way we were raised its so catholic and there are set rules the way things are supposed to be
6995864 but i wouldnt say i agree with it just because of how i was raised
6995865 female perspectives of the representation of women in mens lifestyle and softcore porn magazines
6995866 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
6995867 i have done what a mother wouldnt want for a son
6995868 mr rezko never spoke with nor sought a letter from senator obama in connection with that project
6995869 we anticipate the support for the todays stoppage to be as strong as previous strikes so would advise the public to avoid taking to the sea for non essential activities
6995870 members have rightly grown angry at the scandalous refusal to pay them the same as other emergency service workers and by the governments policy to cap public sector pay increases below inflation
6995871 slowing sales and increasing resale home inventories will pull the ontario housing market into balance and dampen the pace of construction activity next year
6995872 however demand for modestly priced housing will hold up better as declining employment opportunities in higher paying employment sectors encourages demand for both apartment ownership and rental accommodation
6995873 i didnt know if this would work out but julia is a totally welcoming person very community minded and the apartment was a bargain there was never a problem we didnt become buddy buddy like super close friends but we were friendly i did some babysitting for them and if they were having a party i would invite some friends and join them
6995874 they were discreet and i think i was discreet thats probably what made it work
6995875 so wed be going out to a club together to hear a band one week and the next week hes all uptight about my share of the hydro bill
6995876 the guy also entered my place to do some renos without my permission while i was at work which he seemed to think was his prerogative because he owns the house weve sort of worked it out but the relationship is still a bit passive aggressive
6995877 i can picture a circumstance where tenants descend through an oppressive domestic hell but every leg of this journey was a positive experience
6995878 there would occasionally be the kind of minor messes youd expect with kids but you could feel the warmth and respect from julia so it was very beautiful
6995879 if julia hadnt kicked us out we might have stayed forever
6995880 especially after i was separated i felt good having tenants with me
6995881 some people feel its odd to have movements and sounds that arent their own in their house but for me the urban experience is a community experience rattling around in a big house all alone would seem eerie to me
6995882 we made it much harder for crazies to figure out when to break and enter thats got to be a good thing
6995883 its quite a popular family community because it does have a park you dont have to wait five years for it its already there theres the arena right there the public school is right there so those things that people like to have at hand are there
6995884 theres a wide range of house types available so we can appeal to a lot of different kinds of home buyers people who are looking for a townhouse up to a move up house
6995885 many people have been waiting for this site to open up because of its proximity to the escarpment and the natural features that it offers
6995886 there are two phases for vista the first phase has about 300 homes and second is about the same size they are all detached homes on lots ranging from 34 to 50 feet
6995887 the streets have all been oriented to take advantage of the views
6995888 weve retained a natural pond for the site and natural waterways and forest we also have a storm water management pond as well and a school is proposed for the community
6995889 we have many repeat buyers from our original hawthorne village community
6995890 very rock n roll its lounge booth seating they want to rent it for club openings
6995891 we want to be original we like input we listen to what the customers want rick malatesta the owner is intuitive with the customer
6995892 its a great price for a calligaris table from italy with a better mechanism for expandable
6995893 you can put a hot pot on it and just wipe with wet cloth and lemon oil
6995894 over the last decade waterfront cottagers across the province have picked up a bigger share of the load its reached the point where the next generation cant afford the cottage
6995895 my 2005 assessment was up 104 per cent from the one two years prior which meant a 65 per cent increase in property taxes this fall there will be another assessment and research weve done shows that waterfront properties on average across ontario could be up 50 per cent for a 25 per cent tax increase
6995896 fifty per cent of this 400 000 is tax free
6995897 and 50 per cent is included as part of your income of this 200 000 income 100 000 is taxable even if you sell your cottage to your kids for less than its worth
6995898 may cause you to suffer an old age security clawback the clawback occurs when your net income exceeds 63 511 and is fully clawed back when your net income reaches 103 191
6995899 as long as you dont rent the cottage out for income you can use it as your principal residence you don t have to have your drivers licence changed or your mail delivery changed to do this
6995900 if the house youve owned for 30 years has gone up 150 000 and the cottage youve had for 10 years has gone up 100 000 the largest gain per year is on your cottage and you should claim it as your principal residence for the 10 years it was owned you would then claim your house as your principal residence for only 20 years of the 30 years it was owned and pay income tax on about 45 000 of the gain
6995901 a new septic system or roof can increase the cost base which will decrease the capital gain
6995902 if the capital gain is predicted to be 1 million the taxable liability would be 250 000
6995903 it may be cheaper to pay the premium than the liability if you dont build a plan to pay for this liability the children will have to use money from the estate
6995904 when you transfer the cottage to a trust youre still deemed to have sold it but the trust actually owns it
6995905 the parents or the children pay the capital gains on this value so that when the parents pass away this tax has already been paid the cottage can be held in trust for the lifetime of the children but when they pass it on the next generation has to pay the capital gains
6995906 the next generation doesnt always have the same goals as their parents
6995907 its important to have a family discussion and build in a mechanism in your will for ownership so there wont be any fighting for example if one of your children loves the cottage and uses it more than your other children set it out clearly in your will that this child will inherit the property
6995908 one of our kids is in toronto another is in vancouver and our third is in england
6995909 the economies of property taxes are making cottages unaffordable for our children
6995910 it allows me to do with others what i cant do on my own
6995911 i just get a better bang for that big buck
6995912 thats its real claim to fame its lower maintenance and tax costs
6995913 we dont have expensive boilers and chillers and thats where the real savings come in
6995914 however the problem is that there is some trepidation on the part of some lawyers
6995915 there are so few of them that have any real experience with co ownerships or who understand the process
6995916 people are far more comfortable with the condo process because theyre more familiar with it
6995917 if the management agreements are sound it will work as well or even better than a condo
6995918 co ownership is a very well understood concept in places like new york and europe
6995919 because we were familiar with it john and i understood the idea and it didnt scare us
6995920 we looked at places for over 400 000 that you would have to spend another 100 000 on to get things up to speed
6995921 one of the things that sold me on this place is it feels like a house but has the convenience of a condo
6995922 a custom level of building quality and standard features offered at a production home price
6995923 the location of mountain croft is great so we think that well be attracting a number of second home people
6995924 torontos luxury condominium market is a bargain compared to other international cities even though the quality of the product is comparable
6995925 toronto is more affordable to more people than any other international city which is what makes it so unique look at any other city on the world list and there is no way young professionals who have bought condos in downtown toronto could afford to own something comparable in any other city
6995926 it seems unlikely that canada will come out of it totally unscathed
6995927 the new build market typically takes a hit first in a bad economy
6995928 one reason is because theyre built in blocks with developers going to market with hundreds of units when you have this large a volume basic economics says prices must come down so whether youre super rich or not its a riskier proposition
6995929 toronto doesnt really have a super high end when you compare us to other countries we dont cut it
6995930 what we consider the top end is the starting point for other countries
6995931 i guess its all relative i grew up in london ontario and then when i moved to toronto i thought prices were high there too but you have this critical mass of extremely wealthy people who want to live in london because it is a financial and cultural capital
6995932 is a very important second tier city just below centres that are truly global but it doesnt have the size or scale of the other areas
6995933 it does not safeguard against unintentional physical disturbance and only the accessible parts can be sealed
6995934 simply lift the heating grilles that come through the floor
6995935 look at the area where the duct touches the wood floor if its white and looks like white paper or cardboard its probably asbestos and should not be touched if it is black resin it could be sealed asbestos
6995936 my condo decor is very contemporary the colour palette is various tones of grey black white with chrome he matches the interior design everyone comments on that when they first see my place
6995937 i love being able to walk everywhere and having ttc access at my doorstep on spadina i love the layout of my unit it is very open concept my unit is a corner unit so i have 12 foot floor to ceiling windows facing north east with a partial west view also i love the view at night with all the city lights watching the cn tower lights at night can be mesmerizing
6995938 he hid under the couch and under the covers of my bed for the first few weeks he also lost hair on a daily basis due to stress he no longer loses hair thank goodness hes mostly out and about these days but his favourite hiding spot now is behind the washer dryer
6995939 he used to be anti social but now that he is the ber cool kitty he is all about chilling when guests come over
6995940 he helped me get through that and many other difficult periods in my life he gave me a reason to come home at night and also a reason to smile feel needed and feel loved sounds corny but its true
6995941 people meet in the hot tubs or on the tanning deck i also created a facebook group called cityplace west one for people in my building to meet and socialize
6995942 we like to chase each other around the condo from time to time we like to chill on the couch together we like to watch movies in bed he loves it when i buy new furniture that comes in boxes because he loves to play with the papers boxes and twist ties from all the packaging
6995943 but with the advent of the fact checking obsessed blogosphere
6995944 only if they have to check facts presented by someone they genuinely dislike and only in the 5 minutes when the subject is hot
6995945 it was a part of our marketing strategy the concept was thought up at orange poland
6995946 the aim was to warm up the atmosphere around the launch of the iphone
6995947 we were in our house for all that time it was our first and only house and it was a large ravine property thats part of the humber valley system
6995948 but not too seriously all of a sudden this construction site showed up and it indicated these large terraces and thats what made it agreeable to us so we purchased
6995949 and i thought aha we need a professional to give us direction here
6995950 he incorporated what i would like to have into what he knew would work up here i liked the phlox and gloriosa daisies and rudbeckias he said i could have the crabapple we could have the japanese maple i was surprised with the standard hydrangeas because i thought it would have been tricky
6995951 with the peony it is the deep root system and with the irises it was the whole wintering thing
6995952 we were conscious of using dark leaved material like japanese maples physocarpus diablo ninebark and barberry mcglade says
6995953 the burgundy leaves contrast well with the greens of the evergreens
6995954 but it is light years easier than a down to earth garden from that standpoint i dont have any moles burrowing through and i dont have chipmunks coming along and knocking off the tops of the flowers

6995972 the war against terror has to be pursued through a co operative effort between afghanistan pakistan the north atlantic treaty organisation nato and the us unfortunately there was no chemistry between general r pervez musharraf and afghan president hamid karzai which did not facilitate co operation between the two countries i think we will see a more co operative phase after musharraf
6995973 i do not think induction of nato or american troops on the pakistani side is even something that anybody seriously considers
6995974 the sdi software has made the su30 mki platform more versatile and compatible with other air forces

6995976 we have this pattern now of finding temples close to the water or under the water in this most recent case
6995977 these were probably made as part of a very elaborate ritual everything is related to death life and human sacrifice
6995978 caves are natural portals to other realms which could have inspired the mayan myth they are related to darkness to fright and to monsters
6995979 im sure the myths came first and the caves reaffirmed the broad time and space myths of the mayans
6995980 they believed in a reality with many layers the portal between life and where the dead go was important to them
6995981 there are stones huge columns and sculptures of priests in the caves

6996016 es parte de un gui n establecido escrito y decidido
6996017 cu les van a ser las siguientes resoluciones del tc sobre esta materia
6996018 creo que el tc est actuando bajo los dictados del pp y del psoe en el fondo no le han dejado trabajar en libertad le han condicionado y le han poco menos que dictado ya la sentencia de lo que tiene que opinar y decir
6996019 una operaci n del pp y del psoe impulsada por los poderes f cticos econ mico medi tico la justicia y la monarqu a que se oponen no s lo a la propia consulta sino a la democracia participativa
6996020 ojal me equivoque pero ya tiene decidida la sentencia y creo que su posicionamiento va a ser contrario a la posibilidad de celebrar esta consulta
6996021 a la c mara vasca y a pronunciarse antes del 15 de septiembre fecha prevista para la convocatoria de la consulta para evitar
6996022 si no me parecer a una aut ntica verg enza que habr a que denunciar con toda nuestra fuerza
6996023 a la gente no podemos enga arla con una suspensi n del constitucional no es posible celebrar la consulta
6996024 antes o despu s en euskadi habr consulta sobre el tema del conflicto vasco
6996025 una vez despejada esta inc gnita ya hablaremos hemos puesto sobre la mesa muchas iniciativas pero todav a no las hemos consensuado y acordado a la espera del fallo del constitucional
6996026 porque agreg estamos ante una postura no coyuntural sino en una apuesta de fondo de defensa de una democracia de alta intensidad
6996027 no debe generar frustraci n ni en fuerzas pol ticas ni en la ciudadan a
6996028 el mundo no se acaba en una negativa del constitucional a la consulta seguiremos trabajando y m s pronto que tarde a la gente se le va a poder preguntar sobre el llamado conflicto vasco pero tambi n sobre otras cuestiones
6996029 estamos en nuestro derecho y tambi n de expresar nuestras quejas en el mbito de naciones unidas

6996054 during all the years that i have been writing i have steeled myself to the idea that i would not really be accepted at least to my own countrymen until after my death
6996055 sadness is perhaps hardly the right word either since i neither regret the course i have followed nor desire things to be any different i know now what the world is like and knowing i accept it both the good and the evil to live creatively i have discovered means to live more and more unselfishly to live more and more into the world identifying oneself with it and thus influencing it at the core so to speak

6996065 theyre going too far when theyre telling you what to eat what not to eat

6996074 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
6996075 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6996076 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally

6996078 it is a positive thing to utilize the historical structures within daily life without them being destroyed however this must not be at a level which exceeds capacity or eliminates the features needing protection
6996079 even though the first group of structures were designed as theaters they have lost their structural integrity to offer these services due to time and other reasons they have significant stability problems and need special supports and reinforcements even to stand
6996080 taking the abrasion factors due to constant and intense usage into consideration these structures must only be used at limited times with a limited number of people this is the situation in developed countries
6996081 when high attendance figures are added to this situation the result can be dangerous the best example of this is rumelihisar
6996082 since financial resources granted by the state for such endeavors are chronically limited multiple fundraisers and the involvement of private sponsors will become much more prominent in the future than it already is
6996083 performing meaningful art work in a historical environment offers an extraordinary experience the performance and the location unite in period or spirit and the art of the period and the architecture impress the audience the delicate point here is to limit the number of people who visit to maintain the historical tradition in terms of lighting and sound system and the controlled use of modern facilities
6996084 the congestion at concerts held in rumeli hisar is damaging the monument yedikule is almost being used as a hippodrome and the famous golden gate is disappearing behind enormous stages positioned in front of it the surface that has an archaeological value is paved and graveled and the castles grounds are treated like a stabilized highroad
6996085 the intense and incorrect usage may permanently damage our valuable monuments
6996086 the reinforced concrete platform made in 1957 has basic problems
6996087 we are trying not to allow more shows than this
6996088 there are lots of benefits of using places like this if the rules of the council of conservation are followed aspendos is a unique theater in the world sound lighting stage all of them are important there is a technical usage contract in place
6996089 permits for such activities in aspendos are not given easily
6996090 as far as turkey goes this shows europe the urgency of being less dependent on russian energy
6996091 this concern should help create a more united european energy policy that will work to diversify energy dependence and could in the end strengthen the case for the nabucco
6996092 projects like nabucco that are supported by the european union and important from the point of view of supply security will only strengthen turkeys position
6996093 i doubt the georgia conflict will have any significant impact on energy supplies or investments
6996094 what will have a much more significant impact is the terrorist actions which disrupted the btc before the hostilities started
6996095 if its that easy for disorganized terrorists to sabotage the line this is not good news
6996096 negotiations and the work on this issue are still ongoing
6996097 my grandfather was a prisoner caught by circassians during the crimean war 1854 56
6996098 at the time of partition of poland the largest part of the country was annexed by russia and so was the polish army the soldiers who didnt want to fight for the invaders deserted to the ottoman side
6996099 due to difficult conditions many families migrated abroad mostly to australia and canada
6996100 i was also considering to migrate but in the end we only moved to the center of istanbul i decided to come back 10 years ago when the transportation system was improved
6996101 it is very easy to get here once you have a car many renowned turkish personalities come to visit us as well as to settle
6996102 newcomers were needed to maintain the polish population in polonezk y
6996103 thats how my mother got here before the war to marry my father
6996104 i know many turkish wives here who are cultivating polish rituals much more than the polish ones do
6996105 and on all special occasions and holidays we meet all together
6996106 polonezk y has very good relations with beykoz municipality which supports and contributes to the changes we initiate
6996107 last year we opened the first and only bmx park in turkey
6996108 soon were going to present our village at a festival in zakopane
6996109 current activities such as a youth exchange are organized due to the contribution of a turk living in przemysl although originally from zonguldak she is a wonderful promoter of polonezk y
6996110 it is said that you have written to those on this paper when you were in hospital is this true

6996113 the federation is preparing several new projects to not only increase the number of women in the stands but also to increase nationwide support for womens football amongst a wider national audience
6996114 in order to develop female football we need to start from the bottom up from the age of six on we will get nowhere from dealing with the top nobody wants to be a football player after 18
6996115 we try to force womens football in all our activities by applying reverse discrimination for example if someone is establishing a sports camp we try to encourage the organizers to have at least 10 percent female participation
6996116 none of the four major clubs outside of trabzonspor even has a womens football team
6996117 we want to find out why families make their daughters play basketball or volleyball instead of football the results should be available in about six months and we will be directing our projects accordingly
6996118 however many young women we get playing football whether its 10 000 20 000 or 50 000 young girls will actually be changing the profile of the fans in the stands
6996119 womens football is not just about changing the face of football but also about changing society
6996120 the united states sending a military vessel to the black sea is raising suspicions
6996121 the united states and other countries and international organizations have responded to the humanitarian crisis in georgia by sending urgently needed humanitarian aid
6996122 it is not rational to expect turkey to block the passage of military vessels carrying aid to georgia in line with the established principles
6996123 it is a great honor to me that i was the only artist invited from turkey and won the first award out of 300 artists from 80 countries i am very pleased to represent bal kesir and my country
6996124 the olympic organization committee called for me to paint the topics were sports and olympics and china and the world i had never been to china before but inspired by the decrease in bicycle use after the drop of automobile prices in the country and the fact that automobiles cause pollution i chose bicycle as my topic for me it stands for sports socialism environmentalism and economy my work is acrylic on canvas it features bicycles parked on the streets rather than cars the wheels of the bicycles symbolize the rings and colors of olympics after finishing it i sent my painting to the organization
6996125 i explained the situation to the ministry of culture and tourism it was a big surprise that the ministry covered the cost of my flight i would otherwise have missed the chance to receive the most meaningful award of my life
6996126 whether the use of diet patches will amount to foul play
6996127 fasting is a way of disciplining the body those who use diet patches try to achieve the same thats why diet patches are not objectionable
6996128 they told us what are these natashas doing in your vehicle
6996129 we have tried every available means to bring our guests here but unfortunately when they do arrive certain obstacles and epithets have saddened us
6996130 we are not comfortable when we go to the downtown market we tried wandering outside on our first days but several youths started trailing us and we were very uncomfortable many people are staring at us which makes us even more uncomfortable
6996131 when the german group didnt come we were the substitutes who arrived hoping to get to know turkeys east but we are apprehensive about mixing with the young people
6996132 we havent been able to leave our dormitory for fear of being harassed whenever we go somewhere we go as one large group if only we could wander around comfortably we want to share our cultures with the people here unfortunately we are sometimes misunderstood which saddens us
6996133 i thought that was part of the history the murders which took place in this city it needs to be told it needs to be seen it makes things more real
6996134 hollywood has become cool its a shame ultimately the people with the money win
6996135 the explosion occurred in a vacant car left at the blast scene we believe the blast was the result of plastic explosives set off by remote control
6996136 i lived in a two story house but the five story apartment across the street collapsed onto ours someone needs to put a stop to these faulty constructions nine years on i am still scared of apartments and am living in a prefabricated house
6996137 this really upset us the state launches the training program gives them a salary and guarantees a job but no ones interested
6996138 ive done this job for 48 years and i dont know about sandbags sandbags are not used in those tests
6996139 the ship has a 19 person capacity and if there are not any tests such an accident may occur when the ship is on the sea then all 19 passengers on the ship would die
6996140 they were like my sons we were eating together when i visit the shipyard i cried for days after the accident
6996141 we need to show them there is a price to pay which is a cross border project worth ytl 600 000 we havent signed it and told them why
6996142 people go to places where they feel happy and this is one of them
6996143 it feels like home it feels good and natural people make themselves comfortable here
6996144 i think it would be a waste to live here for three years and not doing anything productive
6996145 i search for inspiration in beautiful high quality shops then buy my carpets at the grand bazaar or from warehouses
6996146 turks help me out and sometimes this means we have to communicate with hands and feet but i manage
6996147 i love to sit for hours with these turkish businessmen sipping sweet elma ay and negotiating over another nice kilim
6996148 i buy the kilims per piece and export them to the netherlands i do not have a business name i am doing it for myself under the name of ambulant business
6996149 i buy unique pieces according to my own taste that i believe suit the dutch market
6996150 i aim for an upscale market because kilims are quite expensive
6996151 sometimes i just go there without an appointment and put the kilims right in their face
6996152 we went to the ultimate tourist places not much more
6996153 it is a social network where i can meet other expats
6996154 i like the culture of being outside it gives me a mediterranean feeling we dont have that back home
6996155 i can use skype email and sometimes we have visitors so i keep up with whats happening in the netherlands
6996156 zeynep erol believes that place jewelry concept design music display and performance are fragments of a wholeness
6996157 perceived through the sieve of my childhood memories and adult experiences
6996158 many fish are hard to tell apart once theyve been filleted and packaged
6996159 we hope our work lights the way to getting mislabelled and endangered fish species out of grocery store refrigerators and frying pans
6996160 so here you think youre trying to make the right choice and be a green consumer and you are still eating a threatened species
6996161 i think probably the best way to avoid mislabelling is to work directly through a local fish monger or someone with a reputable business that is with dealing with whole fresh fish
6996162 once that happens in the u s i suspect canada will similarly adopt it
6996163 a pair of kerouacs armed with sharpies and erasers and righteous indignation
6996164 discovered a hand rendered sign inside that i regret to report contained a few errors
6996165 i was reluctant to disfigure the sign any further still i think i shall be haunted by that perversity emense in my train whistle blighted dreams tonight
6996166 it seems more likely at this point that there wont be agreement
6996167 after those meetings things could develop quickly we will have a clear path forward we want to have the meetings soon but i dont think its going to be an eight week melodrama
6996168 if there is an election not only will we be ready but we intend to win it
6996169 i think when a minority government first comes in you get to move on a broad range of legislation and increasingly over a time it takes more and more effort to get less and less done
6996170 we are at a pretty critical time there are economic challenges on the horizon and there are a broad range of items that this government would like to see happen and a broad range of things the opposition would like to see happen that are pretty different than what we want to see an election would clear the air and give a government ours or a liberal government some open water to swim in
6996171 now he wants to change this rule without changing the law so he will break the law
6996172 i dont think ive worked much in the past 30 years to me its been more than a job its been a calling
6996173 im hoping to carry on the mission in a different way
6996174 what hes gotten in trouble for is for giving out statistics on the spot when he didnt have a computer in front of him
6996175 i still remember her light blue camaro and blonde hair and the terrified look on her face
6996176 good for you cam gettin all those bad drivers off the road i see you on tv all the time
6996177 i watch you too we can see through the tv
6996178 people stop me in gas stations on the side of the road wanting my autograph
6996179 but the one wholl miss him most is the media hes always good for a quote
6996180 we operate within transport canada regulations and in this case were within their regulations for operations over water
6996181 how much those life vests weigh and the answer is not very much
6996182 but when youre trying to save every bit of money you can to make the airline more productive every bit counts
6996183 says to me that the financial circumstances of the airline industry are in such disarray that a 1 per cent cost is being considered worthwhile
6996184 i think accumulatively its making air travel a relatively unpleasant experience
6996185 the person has to hold on to it and the difficulty there is if the water is cold you cant hang on very long before your fingers and your hands wont respond
6996186 its standard that any airplane has to be evacuated within a couple of minutes and if youve got everybody standing up in the aisles trying to tear up their seat cushion and carry it under their arms and get out a hatch its really going to slow things down
6996187 my mother father big sister we all sing different songs
6996188 we inherited a sense of rhythm and talent for language i performed songs in hem in georgian laz and greek languages in a concert it was my first i was stunned to sing before 5 000 people
6996189 i am from the black sea and i use my revolver whenever
6996190 here is everything you need now it is your turn to make something out of this
6996191 this is the first government report to present definitive conclusions that number one tobacco advertising and promotion are causally related to increased tobacco use in the population
6996192 and number two it shows that depictions of smoking in movies is causally related to the youth smoking initiation
6996193 any promotional technique that lowers the price the kids see when they go to buy a pack of cigarettes is extremely important
6996194 jimmy bond had a big jet boat chase in live and let die
6996195 i did quite a few run throughs to practice and whilst banking on one such run the engine cut out i had no steering i therefore continued in a straight line directly into a wooden boat house
6996196 there i was as a fearless 007 hobbling on a cane to my boat and then pretending to be indestructible for the cameras who says i cant act
6996197 he was a huge bond fan and said that he would love to direct one of the films
6996198 hed recently had great success with jaws and close encounters and was considered a very hot property i was rather excited at this news and went looking for film producer albert r cubby broccoli to tell him
6996199 do you know how much of a percentage hed want
6996200 its always been policy that no bond director ever got a slice of the box office profits
6996201 so spielberg went off and made indiana jones who i reckon to be a period james bond
6996202 we are entering a very crucial phase the start of direct negotiations we expect that turkey as demanded by the eu will back these talks not only verbally but substantially
6996203 we are not coming to africa for raw material and in search of a supermarket we are interested in lending our manufacturing expertise to africa
6996204 the parties will exchange views on bilateral relations and at the same time members of caricom will be given information about turkeys political and economic potential and foreign policy vision
6996205 the trade volume between turkey and the caribbean countries rose to 200 million usd
6996206 to achieve this goal turkey favors increasing the number of joint business councils
6996207 we believe turkeys action plan for the caribbean is a great framework that foresees a mechanism of cooperation and solidarity
6996208 as long as bombings and armed conflicts persist a solution is harder to reach both sides must appreciate that violence is not a solution the state must take steps other than violent means i believe that the pkk will abandon violence if the state adopts such an attitude
6996209 the kurdish problem can be solved through dialogue and with democratic steps if we are called we will participate in the mgk we received the cold shoulder ever since we arrived in parliament the government must heed our call
6996210 the state must present an alternative solution calling on those in the mountains to surrender is not a solution why should they descend the mountain when no problem is solved
6996211 the real scandal is the ankara chief public prosecutors offices dismissal of proceedings on the grounds that the president cannot be held accountable for personal crimes he committed
6996212 one cannot argue that a president has immunity against personal crimes as well this means he could even kill a person this type of mentality has no place in penal or the constitutional law
6996213 the decision must still be objected now only the finance ministry can do it but i do not think they ever will
6996214 it is true that he is not an accused before the changes in the penal code in 2005 a person suspected of committing a crime was called an accused now he is called the suspect
6996215 the suit for damages is one thing the penal case against him is another
6996216 some engineers have developed dam projects for dry rivers and sold them to the private sector during spring the flow of these rivers may be high but in summer they drop
6996217 when the river runs dry dam administrators will get water from its spring and start producing energy by collecting the water needed by nature as these valleys start to suffocate water wars will break out
6996218 in the summer drought water of the river is only enough for part of the people who live here
6996219 some of you say we are civil servants some of you remain silent with the hopes of employment those who build dams will provide jobs for you only during construction then you will lose not only your jobs but also your water
6996220 we are the state if we do not exist the state would not exist either
6996221 our fruits get rotten we do not want them to expel us out of our land
6996222 we have determined the owners of 112 houses which are built for lower income groups this is the first stage of the projects which will be established for lower income groups those who were not elected should not feel sorry for the results they always have the chance to become house owners in the new housing projects which will be built in the upcoming years
6996223 we are among the 100 greatest hotel chains of the world
6996224 our next objective is to become one of the 50 biggest hotel chains in the world
6996225 we are cooperating with tui with respect to the administration of these hotels said y lmaz adding
6996226 enterprises with financial difficulties hand over their facilities as a last resort
6996227 operating costs have increased remarkably in the sector and hence it will become much more difficult for individual enterprises to survive alone
6996228 this situation in turn will have two major repercussions for the sector the enterprises will either change the owners of the properties or they rent out these facilities and withdraw from the sector
6996229 these changes might take place at a faster pace in the upcoming periods
6996230 not over and im not exactly sure when its going to end
6996231 as the crisis continues you will see a lot of business failures
6996232 there is still a tremendous amount of deleveraging still necessary
6996233 it was a massive failure of the brains of the economy
6996234 there was a party going on and the regulator with the same mindset of those in the party didnt want to be a party pooper
6996235 we may have to wait until early 2009 before we get the first interest rate cut because the inflation situation still looks pretty forbidding
6996236 all the central banks can provide now is time for the banking system to heal
6996237 what more they have to offer is now very limited
6996238 the fed really has to hope and pray that credit markets begin to heal by themselves
6996239 many central banks have been in a position where they have been focused on inflation and they did not have the same intensity of the slowdown that we saw in the u s said former fed governor laurence meyer vice chairman at macroeconomic advisers in washington in an interview at jackson hole
6996240 higher mortgage rates and sharply tightening credit standards in mortgages have gummed up a key channel through which monetary easing is supposed to stimulate aggregate demand
6996241 they have done a lot and at some point they simply have to give the markets the time needed to heal
6996242 there will have to be a lot of soul searching about whether central banks in their rush to forestall a financial disaster have created moral hazard and perverse incentives on an unprecedented scale
6996243 it has been 41 years since any boat has traveled in those waters and we plan to be the first
6996244 the siege that the israelis have imposed on gaza is not only illegal in terms of international law it is also immoral
6996245 global institutions and the governments of the world know what is happening and are not doing anything about it
6996246 provided documentation was in order they could sail thats the law and we cannot break it
6996247 there is this slow genocide going on in gaza and nobody is taking any notice
6996248 when the holocaust happened the whole world looked the other way while this atrocity against humanity was unfolding and it was often said we cannot allow this to happen again
6996249 only a strong military can deter outside aggression and protect the lives and safety of the people
6996250 one of the aims of irans 10 year space program is to send a manned rocket into space

6996253 t rk telekom plans to bid for the kyrgyzstan governments stake in kyrgyz telecom the nations land line monopoly
6996254 they were able to borrow without any of the normal restraints they had a blank check from the federal government
6996255 kept existing because they had the federal government behind them
6996256 european customers regularly wait for new models to come out therefore europe has the widest spectrum of the automotive industry
6996257 if they reduce the production of new models auto manufacturers can maintain their profitably only for a short period until the new demand rains in
6996258 we received more positive signals in the second quarter in terms of growth and operational profitability ahead supporting our view that tofas is one of the major growth stories in the turkish industrial sector
6996259 the obama desire to get out and the mccain desire to succeed could be coming together in the form of an ability to get out while succeeding
6996260 the simple truth is that we do not have sufficient forces in iraq to meet our military objectives
6996261 facts have to affect your decision making and over the course of 16 months things are going to constantly change
6996262 he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq even today with victory in sight
6996263 the monsoon fury has affected 1 29 million people a total of 3 173 villages are affected while 674 villages have been totally marooned

6996265 the video shows that the plane caught fire only after it hit the ground
6996266 the fault fixed by spanairs maintenance technicians could not have had an influence on the crash
6996267 there was more than one cause an engine was not the cause of the accident
6996268 everything we did with the aircraft was by the rules
6996269 technically by aug 19 the judges should have been reinstated
6996270 should be debated on monday and tuesday and on wednesday this resolution should be passed and the judges should be reinstated
6996271 wednesday should not be considered the final word there could be a delay of a day or two but you will see results in a week or so
6996272 if somebody thinks that people will be satisfied after musharrafs removal let me tell you that people want the rule of law
6996273 the only thing you could host that is bigger is the olympics
6996274 this year weve gotten the press that paris and tuscany normally get
6996275 for a major tourism area like we are thats priceless
6996276 typically being a holiday week its a slower week so its a great fit
6996277 at least three of the following five colors red green yellow blue purple and white
6996278 because youre the city that people go to when they think of serious green topics
6996279 the ana afghan national army and coalition forces killed 30 insurgents
6996280 exactly the main question is where there is nothing left anymore
6996281 they shot at peacekeepers and ossetians and when the georgian shelling started they called each other and congratulated each other
6996282 put some rak soaked bread on the roof one taste and theyll never come back
6996283 the day that the disappearance of the indigenous communities in the jungles and mountains was avoided
6996284 this is a new dawn for the people of this country and for all peruvians who wish to develop in freedom not in oppression
6996285 if that were to happen out of fear of protesters fear of unrest peru would some day remember it as the moment when change came to a halt and hundreds of thousands of people were condemned to poverty exclusion and marginalisation
6996286 if we still lived on the european side with the noise and the traffic and not knowing our neighbors i wouldnt be able to make it this far
6996287 that pretty much sums up the situation of the coast
6996288 you can be in taksim in half an hour and come home to peace quiet and safety
6996289 where everyones welcome and they accept everyone as they are and different views and you still know your neighbors name
6996290 we know how good we have it so we dont go around telling everyone about it so we dont get those yahoos moving over here and screwing it up
6996291 strong and durable must the body of the vimana be made like a great flying bird of light material inside one must put the mercury engine with its ion heating apparatus underneath by means of the power latent in the mercury which sets the driving whirlwind in motion a man sitting inside may travel a great distance in the sky the movements of the vimana are such that it can vertically ascend descend move slanting forwards and backwards
6996292 the weapon was a single projectile charged with all the power of the universe an incandescent column of smoke and flame as bright as the thousand suns rose in all its splendor an iron thunderbolt a gigantic messenger of death which reduced to ashes the entire race of the vrishnis and the andhakas the corpses were so burned as to be unrecognizable the hair and nails fell out pottery broke without apparent cause and the birds turned white
6996293 a critical outlook toward the historical myths of our recent history
6996294 the akp reality and the fiasco of the secular coup
6996295 undertakings given at the 2007 forum in tonga to hold an election by march 2009
6996296 for the first time this pacific islands forum has condemned directly the actions of bainimarama in failing to honour his undertakings to the pacific island leaders a year or so ago
6996297 secondly for the first time the leaders of the pacific islands forum have embraced the possibility of suspension of a member state to be adopted against fiji should they continue not to embrace their undertakings for march 2009 elections
6996298 we decided to do something with sheep poo because theres very little else thats so abundant here
6996299 we tried using our food blender with my wifes pillowcase as a filter and ended up with terrible paper
6996300 some of wales finest walking riding mountain biking climbing caving and kayaking is right here in brecon beacons national park
6996301 im in favor of another agreement whatever it takes to stop the conflict but you know it just cannot have as a tradeoff the criminals going scott free
6996302 its a very sad day its a very emotional day
6996303 we have always said that the roles missions and size of the american forces here the coalition forces was based on the conditions on the ground and what is needed
6996304 will review the security situation in the country and if necessary will ask the american side for certain forces for training or supporting the iraqi security forces
6996305 i teach my people the traditional ways traditional food so they know where they come from
6996306 some men they just think its the ladies fault they dont want to admit maybe they are sleeping around

6996308 ob is the shortened version of the late oshivambo chief who lived at the end of the street close to the church
6996309 you might have seen the man painted on the door of his late house with the fist in the air which is a symbol of freedom fighter for the swapo political party the s is for street obanntja uushona is the full name of the chief

6996316 its great i come from a country where we only have 120 bmx riders
6996317 i hope this achievement will make people sit up and take notice of us and help us to get better
6996318 earlier in the year we had an 82 year old woman from florida

6996320 vlm airlines is honoured to receive this prestigious award which is a powerful endorsement of service from the people that really matter passengers we are dedicated to providing the highest levels of service and strive continually to set new standards
6996321 this award is particularly pleasing in that it demonstrates quality of service and service clearly matter to customers on short haul services vlm airlines were strongly supported in this survey category and were frequently singled out for the high standards of staff service they deliver the award is very much a recognition of the those customer facing staff
6996322 any rulemaking which would require that passenger car tires be labeled to indicate their low rolling resistance or fuel economy characteristics
6996323 its the biggest moment of my life everything is a big miracle
6996324 we have asked the gymnastics federation to look into what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies on this subject
6996325 we are happy to get a chance to practice caring for animals
6996326 we also had a good time with the people here we hope to be back here when we graduate
6996327 now are you sure this that those will be ready
6996328 i wish everybody was like ahane she is a very sophisticated person who grew up in the west and worked in the united nations she is very idealistic her family is also a very respectable turkish family
6996329 i am with your husband he laughs at you very much
6996330 the basis of the allegations leans upon political conflicts in the party following the release of my book i was expecting reactions from the public opinion some people profited by the allegations and used them against me
6996331 ahane wrote two theses on turkey and she is a turkey lover since we know her knowledge we ran her as candidate at the first rank it is true that we increased her age
6996332 the strike is part of continuing protests against indias rule in kashmir
6996333 it is also to demand our right to self determination through a referendum
6996334 the fighting that is still raging has so far left five militants and three soldiers dead including a colonel
6996335 deeply concerned that russian forces have not withdrawn to the position as agreed
6996336 they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6996337 they dont really believe that the theater missile defense components in poland and in the czech republic although they are very small are in fact in the end really intended for iran
6996338 the other piece of this is that the russians have opposed the general national military defense program of the united states for a very long time
6996339 and they put the two things together they think this is the camels nose under the tent that the united states is putting in place in alaska now in central europe and who knows where next the components of an effective for a much more extensive ballistic missile defense system that would be directed against russian nuclear capabilities
6996340 the president traveled to georgia august 13 when there was a rally in tbilisi and stood beside georgian president mikhail saakashvili and said now we see the real face of russia
6996341 here is the president of poland clearly suggesting that russia is a serious military threat to all its neighbors that is obviously going to lead to the action that its has taken that is to defend itself as best it can
6996342 the russian military actions in georgia not only broke through whatever resistance the polish government had to doing the deal without getting further satisfaction on the terms of the deal but in addition pushed both sides to build in these extra defensive measures which are clearly directed against russia
6996343 no one raises any question but that the patriot missile battery or batteries that are to be put in poland plus the joint administration and patrolling of them by both u s and polish forces is designed for russia
6996344 if the russians should do anything to attack those missiles and american lives are at risk then that would mean that the debate about whether or not the united states would actually do something to protect members of nato would become academic
6996345 and indeed because american troops were there it would serve as a trigger and the united states would react
6996346 we are coming apart at the seams in every sense
6996347 nearly two months to have a pair of trousers mended which had been torn by a not completely screwed down screw on a jump seat meanwhile alitalia is back in the news with plans of new cuts they want to make but i have already made my cuts
6996348 once again we are short of cutlery so i am hard at work washing re washing and drying
6996349 there is a meal missing either it wasnt loaded or there are more passengers than we had booked
6996350 the undercarriage is nude without mudguards the plane can only fly if it doesnt rain we are fine until the end of september but only in the south nothing to put security at risk
6996351 if one is not in line with the norms and dictates alitalia does not take off
6996352 international statistics confirm that alitalia is one of the most secure airlines in the world
6996353 perhaps aviator az does not take into account the delicate situation in which we find ourselves

6996424 while larger corporations will always be a major contributing factor to any economy smaller businesses encourage the entrepreneurial spirit and brings local jobs to each community therefore we felt by restructuring our programs we would be helping smaller businesses to incorporate it is our belief that by doing so we will be helping to bring more jobs to local economies and help to reduce unemployment

6996454 i probably wont be able to get a job anywhere else in the world having this mark that im on this list
6996455 it is quite clear when the government does something that takes away not just your job but your occupation your career they have to provide you with some means to clear your name
6996456 i have no idea why i am on the list and theyre not telling officially that im even on the list
6996457 unfortunately it is a problem that is shared by countless individuals who have no connection to terrorism have no connection to crime and dont belong on this list
6996458 the problem with what the government is doing is that they really dont care about innocent casualties
6996459 we served in a war and theyre thumbing their noses at us basically and that makes me feel really sad about this situation
6996460 this discovery gives immensely powerful support to the proposition that dinosaur fossils are not millions of years old at all but were mostly fossilized under catastrophic conditions a few thousand years ago at most

6996464 why would you start cutting and pasting now isnt that against your rules
6996465 how do you figure you cant prove that anything is 65 million years old none of the dating methods work you cant use the geological column because to make that work you have to use circular reasoning again a failure
6996466 we can only 100 date something and thats through history and we can only go back 4000 or so years with that
6996467 so to pull up 65 million year old dino bones and still have soft tissue in them is ludicrous

6996483 chi pensa che obama possa vincere alla grande le elezioni non ha idea delle dimensioni del fenomeno che nei nostri studi definiamo razzismo backstage quello cio non dichiarato
6996484 a partire dagli anni sessanta gli americani hanno imparato che non politicamente corretto dichiarare a chi li intervista il loro pregiudizio
6996485 anche gore non era riuscito a conquistare il loro voto
6996486 lunico problema che questo vantaggio significa poco in un sistema elettorale in cui non si vince grazie al voto popolare ma conquistando il collegio elettorale
6996487 grazie alle sue qualit e alla implosione del partito repubblicano obama potrebbe galvanizzare abbastanza giovani e minoranze per vincere ma la sua non certo una coalizione di maggioranza
6996488 ben prima del suo viaggio europeo obama cercava di apparire presidenziale perch sa di essere un giovane nero venuto dal nulla che la gente conosce da un anno appena con il suo comportamento aiuta chi non riesce neanche a concepire un presidente nero a immaginarlo
6996489 il problema di tutti questi aggiustamenti che alcuni dei giovani che appoggiavano incondizionatamente obama ora si dichiarano delusi di trovarsi di fronte a un candidato normale
6996490 il problema non tanto la violazione della correttezza politica ma il clima generale di queste elezioni stavolta le campagne negative sembrano ottenere poco

6996495 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6996496 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
6996497 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6996498 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6996499 the official who spoke did so on condition of anonymity
6996500 officials said the obama campaign had taken the trouble to print material bearing the names of several potential ticketmates thereby minimizing the significance of a report that a printing company in kansas was churning out signs bearing bayhs name

6996575 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
6996576 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
6996577 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats

6996654 weve got to step up and make a name for ourselves
6996655 we all have a lot of things we need to accomplish this season
6996656 theyre certainly capable enough athletic enough based on comparisons to guys weve played with here and now its going to be interesting to see what they do
6996657 they both have three years ahead of them and theyve got some good experience
6996658 when guys were going down i came in at the end and held my own
6996659 when they came on the field they were fresh and they were ready to go
6996660 now the thing is can they go a whole game can they go 70 downs as opposed to teeing it up and going 10 downs
6996661 were going to have to bring intensity and be mentally focused and physically tough enough to play 90 downs
6996662 its going to be hard but we can do it
6996663 were definitely young guys and were going to have to step up our role
6996664 i can give speed off the edge so you dont have to touch those big 300 pounders
6996665 if you have four guys that can put the pressure on youre sitting in the pear tree
6996666 that means were not doing our job we take pride in that its extremely important
6996667 and i think thats what you do in life thats what you do in sports
6996668 you dont ignore the past certainly were proud of the good things weve done and were hoping to learn and correct the things that havent been so good but you move on this is a new season a new year
6996669 besides the physical pain you know whats coming ahead of you it was tough
6996670 i was hoping to give it to him on a happy occasion
6996671 he had earned it when he got hurt i wanted to make sure he knew how we felt about him
6996672 i wouldve told him a different time if that werent the case its the worst thing for a player to go through he clearly earned it
6996673 the day i did it coach ferentz put me on scholarship
6996674 hes a heck of a guy he didnt have to honor his word and he did hes a great coach
6996675 i had zero division i scholarships i had zero partial scholarships from division i schools
6996676 iowa was always honest with me some other schools werent as honest they never told me i was going to have a scholarship they told me theres a chance but probably not
6996677 when it came down to it its a school that has been honest and open with me the whole time and i can respect that
6996678 i figured i could respect myself a lot more if i walked on to a program like this
6996679 thats one of the things i looked at when i walked on here the more the better we push each other everyone is pushing each other im open to it its a great opportunity for both of us it should be good to push each other and get better
6996680 growing up seeing the great guys at iowa even in high school i looked up to robert gallery and bruce nelson and even when i got here mike elgin and marshall yanda we have to come together as a unit and respect that tradition
6996681 this is 2008 this is a new season ever since weve been here weve wanted to do well each and every year thats been our goal going in some years are more realistic than others certainly for a couple different reasons
6996682 when youre coaching college football its about the players these guys have killed themselves the past year getting themselves ready to play again in 2008
6996683 im not concerned about anything but doing the best job we can to get these guys ready the best football were capable of playing at the university of iowa its as simple as that we cant be concerned with anything other than that
6996684 every year you start again in this profession in this kind of thing if you sit and dwell on the past and worry about everything thats happened in the past youre going to go backward our job is to go forward from here
6996685 you always have to win the games you should win and have the opportunity to win
6996686 we had a lot of opportunities last year to win games it comes down to one or two plays the last series the last drive if you go back and look a lot of those games we shouldve won and had an opportunity to win that we didnt win
6996687 that couldve made those seasons where we wouldnt be sitting here talking about 6 6 or 7 5 wed be sitting here talking about the bowl games or the winning seasons we had
6996688 he looked at every aspect of everything we were doing we looked at every aspect of everything we were doing and we just feel like things are there we need to improve and get better at what were doing its as simple as that
6996689 i know its not where it needs to be and i dont mean in terms of character and off the field issues i just mean in terms of production on the field
6996690 im not going to say they dont respect us i think coach ferentz has built a very respectable program but i think we surprised people last year i think they expected more of us and no one has more expectations than us no one has more pride in this program than us
6996691 we have great fans but were doing this 365 days a year so no one has more invested in this than us it hurts us more than anything when theres negative talk and when things happen that are unfortunate
6996692 i cant wait to silence everybody i dont think any of us can
6996693 you play to gain the respect of other people you play to win and i dont see any reason why we cant do that if we can just get it clicking we just have to make up our minds and do it
6996694 people said what they said about me i cant stop them from saying what they wanted to say
6996695 i mean its flattering but i just do what i can
6996696 coming in i just wanted to contribute what i could to the team and just listen to the coaches
6996697 they were trying to coach me up on everything because i came in as a high schooler and this is the big ten this is iowa football
6996698 the legacies that have gone through here the gallerys and steinbachs and bruce nelsons all those guys there is so much to be learned coming in as a freshman you really need to be able to take a step back and clear your head and learn everything you can because there are a lot of ways to improve as a player
6996699 there definitely is a maturing process where youve got to come in and you really need to just find where youre at as far as physically and mentally and find ways to improve
6996700 and thats by watching tape and listening to the older guys and talking to your coaches and then just applying it
6996701 coming in i just tried not to even think about that the whole recruiting process and whatever people said about me because this is all different
6996702 this is a totally different part of my life im in a different state im at a different school a different team different coaches its a different atmosphere its two different worlds
6996703 guys are twice as fast and twice as strong you definitely need a few years and a lot of practices
6996704 and for the guys who can jump right in there thats great it shows that theyve got a lot of great talent and everything
6996705 a guy like bulaga was able to come in and contribute early thats very rare usually offensive line is a difficult position to play usually it takes a minimum of two years and sometimes three
6996706 but dans coming around were excited about him this fall
6996707 i think theres a lot of pressure on a young man like dan certainly not imposed on himself
6996708 and i think dan really took some steps forward he just finally said hey im going to do it to his credit he just did an exceptional job really improved his fundamentals he earned the right to be on the field it wasnt like somebody else screwed up he was the guy that got better and better throughout practice
6996709 i cannot imagine we quarrelling can you promise me not to let that happen
6996710 i completed my two year contract and i feel like i accomplished what i set out to do
6996711 we value and appreciate the vision bob has put in place for montalvo
6996712 he has helped us broaden our artistic programs by integrating contemporary art throughout the organization
6996713 im using a satellite thats orbiting the asteroid and the rotation of the asteroid itself to wrap this ribbon
6996714 so its kind of like it wraps as it rotates
6996715 what happens then is light from the sun shines on the body of the asteroid so more of it is reflected and it actually acts to move it away from the sun and the earth
6996716 its kind of like a very very bad day for earth
6996717 scientists say if it did impact the earth it would carry the force of 110 000 hiroshima bombs
6996718 at that time well probably be able to refine its orbit and determine how likely it is to hit the earth
6996719 if this one were to hit the earth you could say that most of life would be extinguished

6996785 i learned how to win and be comfortable to be fast believe in myself and not be afraid to actually go for it
6996786 his coach michael creamer and he have this understanding and mutual respect
6996787 i think michael knows how to settle him down keep him focused plus hes a technical wizard
6996788 i think that gave tom the confidence and the knowledge to learn about what hes all about and its endurance and thats what we saw today he knows that now he always was that but he didnt know it
6996789 i think itll take a while to sink in just like the fact that i made it here took a while to sink in
6996790 it took me i dont know how long to realize i was actually coming here i think when i got here i finally realized it this is a whole new level i think itll sink in eventually i dont think ill sleep tonight its pretty crazy pretty crazy
6996791 i feel like the weight of the one ring is now off my shoulders maybe
6996792 people are saying we control our own destiny given the steady diet of contenders theyre facing and its true but youve got to win these games for that to happen
6996793 when joe ingletts not leading off and seeing lyle overbay up there knowing everything thats going to come out my hand
6996794 in boston i think he might have been a little nervous he made some mistakes early and we were able to take advantage tonight we really didnt give him a chance to get into trouble
6996795 i think i felt as good as ive felt all year
6996796 but tonight it was just a lack of command maybe i was trying to be too perfect
6996797 id rather he hit the ball over the wall okay not with the bases loaded though than give up a free one like that

6996815 he didnt say anything he just got ready and away he went its hard to find those sort of blokes
6996816 i didnt tell them i didnt want to share my misery of all the players why did they ring and tell me about him why didnt they ring and tell me about someone else
6996817 i carried enough grief in thinking that he mightnt play without having to inform the players i was on the couch and needed treatment
6996818 i definitely wasnt going to anyone else hes just one of those blokes who puts himself in the right spot at the right time every time thats why hes the champion he is
6996819 when you see those doors open and you get that knock to go out on the field and hes in front of you you know youre in with a shot at the game hes just an incredible bloke to play with

6996839 she was as much a victim in this whole thing as anyone
6996840 obviously not physically but to have to witness the things she had to see and go through the loss she had to endure is not an easy thing its a testament to her strength that shes working through it
6996841 we talk a couple of times a day three if need be we try to stay in as constant contact as we can because even though im here we all are in it together
6996842 she said she appreciates our effort and all that weve done
6996843 certainly its good for her family to see were out here trying as hard as we can whether thats a tribute or not is up to them the last two weeks have been a roller coaster i would say as a person who is not fond of roller coasters
6996844 the olympics is already emotionally charged fighting for your country for pride then you throw in the bachman tragedy you throw in miles britton a make a wish foundation kid we had in our camp his only wish was to watch usa volleyball play
6996845 im not so sure four years ago the team wouldnt have folded
6996846 im going to attribute that change to hugh mccutcheon when he came in he decided we werent going to settle for being middle of the road for being maybe a contender he got a new philosophy of working hard working together no superstars everyone bought into it
6996847 obviously we would have understood if he wanted to go home
6996848 the olympics are the olympics its not life its two weeks of your life that are important but not nearly as important as your family your wife and her family
6996849 is i know so many more lives are invested in this than just my own in terms of what our team is trying to do here given that responsibility given that im the leader of this team i know theres some accountability on my part to make sure im here and able to do my job
6996850 that is one of the many admirable traits about him
6996851 its a fantastic achievement and ill embrace it and enjoy it but as soon as were done ive got to get back where im needed
6996852 the russians have organized an ecological catastrophe burning in the course of a few days the centuries old forest in the unique borzhomi nature reserve
6996853 but considering the extent of the fire the difficulty of getting into that isolated area the wind and other problems
6996854 russia prohibited ukraine from taking part in the suppression of the fire
6996855 i was expecting a faster pace they didnt do it i can outkick them anytime so i waited
6996856 in terms of achievement yes she might have surpassed tulu
6996857 but given that tirunesh is so shy and withdrawn she hasnt been getting all the credit she deserves
6996858 i only speak about myself and will only answer questions about myself
6996859 my mother called him and said that he should get off but my father said they would not let him
6996860 i was deeply affected to learn that she died and had given her life for her daughter
6996861 i took one child into the truck and he thought he was in a film he asked when will this film end and where is my dad
6996862 he thought he was in a film and he wanted the film to end
6996863 alfredo was incredibly together when we found him he was complaining about some pain but what most worried him was finding his parents
6996864 when we took off i heard a horrible noise and the next thing i remember was being flung from the aircraft i lifted my head and all i saw were scattered bodies
6996865 i remember noticing there was something wrong with the plane then i remember lifting my head up and the plane had no roof

6996867 the strike is part of continuing protests against indias rule in kashmir

6996879 as far as the military is concerned we have reports to prove that more than rebels were killed in the fighting
6996880 it trash thats military propaganda and only seven of our members were killed but we can say that dozens of government soldiers perished in the fighting
6996881 we have done our best to embrace peace but the milf started the hostilities by pillaging villages and murdering innocent civilians in mindanao we are now implementing the full force of the law and we will arrest those responsible for the traitorous attacks against civilians
6996882 all these groups which have been so noisy in the past about human rights issues suddenly are silent about the atrocities committed by the milf rebels this clearly shows that these organizations are also terrorists which have no respect for human lives security and welfare of the people
6996883 milf units that targeted villages have engaged in serious violations of international law and should be held to account
6996884 experience from around the world shows that the deployment of civilian militias can set off a chain of reprisals and only increases the danger facing civilians
6996885 all sides to this conflict should step back from the brink and demonstrate their commitment to avoid harming civilians the milf must control its forces and the philippine government should take responsibility for the security of all peoples in the philippines regardless of religion or ethnicity
6996886 we cannot subject our members to the laws of the government
6996887 this is grim scenario and i dont even want to think about it but if the peace talks collapse then there will be war again in mindanao
6996888 the voice of reason is dwarfed by the voice of hatred and prejudice the peace talks are slowly breaking apart and if this continues may god help us all

6996891 in der formel 1 ver ndern sich die dinge st ndig und passen sich an in nascar f hrt man f r immer mit denselben komponenten es geht nur um die rennen wie das auto abgestimmt ist und welche entscheidungen du w hrend des rennens trifft entscheiden wer gewinnt und wer nicht
6996892 in der formel 1 kannst du nach dem qualifying relativ leicht vorhersagen was passieren wird das kannst du hier nicht tun die strategie ist angesichts der gelben flaggen eher ein r tselraten es gibt keine computer manchmal nicht einmal ein notebook du reagierst auf deine gef hle das ist cool
6996893 zu dieser zeit explodierte das ganze problem mit franz denn er war ein idiot aber franz ist eine sehr emotionale person wenn ich zur ckblicke wie es dazu gekommen ist so hatte ich mit franz nie wirklich ein problem es war gerhard berger der eine menge druck auf franz bez glich uns aus bte ich und vitantonio liuzzi hatten bis zur formel 1 gute karriere
6996894 gerhard begann es f r tonio und mich sehr schwierig zu machen er wollte ver nderungen und hatte seine eigene agenda
6996895 in der formel 1 ist alles am limit das ist das coole an ihr aber es ist kein rennsport mehr in der formel 3 und in der gp2 f hrst du hart in der formel 1 f hrst du in den ersten paar runden rennen dann ist alles strategie das ist nicht so aufregend wie das was ich jetzt mache
6996896 ber die dtm wird auch in gro britannien viel berichtet ich selbst habe es immer verfolgt auch schon als ich kart gefahren bin
6996897 die serie ist bei uns sehr respektiert wenn man also die chance bekommt in der dtm zu fahren ergreift man sie beim schopf
6996898 die fans erleben tollen rennsport und haben ein gro artiges wochenende es wird viel m he reingesteckt dass das ganze wochenende f r die fans etwas besonderes wird es ist nicht nur das rennen selbst auch sonst ist rund um die strecke jede menge los um die fans das ganze wochenende ber zu unterhalten
6996899 es hei t zwar tourenwagen aber die autos hneln viel mehr einem formel auto sowohl von den rundenzeiten her als auch vom fahrstil her ich w rde es als vielen gr nden nicht als tourenwagen klassifizieren sie sind viel schneller und ich denke auch viel beeindruckender zum anschauen
6996900 das ist eine sehr schwierige strecke es gibt nur vier kurven das klingt zun chst mal so als ob es sehr einfach zu lernen ist aber da die strecke sehr kurz ist werden die zeiten unglaublich nah beieinander liegen schon der kleinste fehler kann bedeuten dass man statt auf p5 auf p10 steht wenn man alles richtig macht kann das das z nglein an der waage sein das wird wirklich hart
6996901 ich wohne nur eine stunde weg von brands hatch deshalb freue ich mich schon riesig darauf zur ckzukehren und in gro britannien zu fahren vor allem in brands hatch hatte ich schon viel erfolg und meine familie wird nat rlich auch dabei sein und meine freunde auch
6996902 ich denke dass ich einen guten start ins jahr hatte auch wenn es manchmal h tte etwas besser laufen k nnen ich lerne immer dazu und wir steigern uns weiter es war bisher ein erfolgreiches jahr aber wir wollen nat rlich noch ein paar punkte holen
6996903 ja ich kenne lewis und seine familie recht gut aus der zeit im kartsport wir sind zwar nicht in kontakt geblieben aber ich treffe seine familie hin und wieder an diversen rennstrecken in silverstone beim grand prix zum beispiel habe ich kurz mit seinen eltern gesprochen es ist toll dass lewis kommt das ist noch ein bonus f r die fans

6996906 ive just played this franchise for 2 weeks training my players working on contracts scouting draftees making trades for draft picks trying to replace retiring legends through quality draft picks only to have it freaking lock up when trying to sim games train players advance to the off season right around year 5 or 6 again and again and again and again and again

6996910 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
6996911 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6996912 mostly because he would give a big shot of energy to the ticket
6996913 it opens the dialogue and encourages my teen driver to discuss driving situations i am surprised at how much they retain and recall years later
6996914 the freedom of driving is an extremely powerful motivator friends of our children also know the rules
6996915 every time we go out she sits in the passenger seat and observes
6996916 i explain why i do the things i do move out of the outside lane on highways in order to permit merging traffic checking for red light beaters before entering an intersection on a new green light checking over my left shoulder before opening the driver door on busy streets for cyclists
6996917 kids feel it is their right to drive rather than it being a privilege to be worked for and earned
6996918 it was cool it was a real pick me up
6996919 this is the part where your kids in the other room will be smiling
6996920 but in here its when i always see the frowns start to appear
6996921 then youre going to have to talk to your child
6996922 our relationship is with our student the way this works is if your student is conscious and competent and says no we arent contacting you
6996923 were really interested in reaching parents to ensure they understand there can be a plan b in terms of a students career choice
6996924 many students have one profession in mind and parents need to understand there are other options
6996925 its not just about the students not wanting you to know its about learning to sort things out themselves
6996926 were seeing less of them phoning up and saying things like i need my kids book list because they wont know how to buy them all
6996927 it reinforced the situation and made me think kate and i have to have a lot of conversations around how were going to be sharing information
6996928 the potential for fulfilling her dreams has nothing to do with me though i might be a voice in the background
6996929 i definitely wont be texting home every day but ill call and give her a heads up on how im doing
6996930 church is a bit of a mystery to most people these days
6996931 but by focusing on sunday school we may have implied that its something you grow out of
6996932 they may not know why but they may discover that with the proper support and encouragement
6996933 it is really intimidating for a person to walk into a building that looks like a brick fort and have no idea whats going on inside
6996934 and unless you do that step over the threshold from the street into a church will be far too massive for most people
6996935 it is often seen as a bit of a club a group of people who are all familiar with the material
6996936 if you dont know this stuff you think it all matters
6996937 anyone who is interested in actually rolling out of bed on a sunday morning to go to church really wants to know what the others think
6996938 it can be terrifying to be thrown into something and not understand the larger context
6996939 you would think something like that would drive people away
6996940 what strokes can you do just the doggie paddle jump in and see if you can make it to the other side way to go okay now who wants to be vice captain what you can do the backstroke breaststroke and the crawl sorry theres no place for show offs on this team
6996941 paralympic athletes and disabled spectators are a special group they have unique personalities and ways of thinking
6996942 some physically disabled are isolated unsocial and introspective they can be stubborn and controlling defensive and have a strong sense of inferiority
6996943 physically disabled people are often mentally healthy they show no differences in sensation reaction memorization and thinking mechanism from other people but they might have unusual personalities because of disfigurement and disability
6996944 when you make eye contact do not fuss or show unusual curiosity never stare at their disfigurement
6996945 a patronizing or condescending attitude will be easily sensed even for a brain damaged patient

6996949 ive had people calling me and saying can you get us in there are people who just want to jump in their car and go there i think more american people are engaged in this election than ever before
6996950 the objective is to come out of the convention unified behind our candidate which is going to be barack obama and making sure we win in november
6996951 i want to take the opportunity to enjoy it baracks speech at the end is going to set the tone and provide the motivation for what lies ahead through september and october
6996952 every one of my friends is jealous but so happy for me

6996994 if we do what bravo is doing what makes us different from bravo
6996995 what higher moral ground can we claim if we do the same thing that he doing
6996996 the repercussions on the relations between people in the area may be irreversible it may slide into a conflict we could never recover from because people will start hating each other not because they are part of the milf or part of the government but because of what they believe in
6996997 they milf can do several things to stop the offensives number one they can surrender their commanders number two they can promise to rein in their people to make sure that they cannot do criminal activities or atrocities
6996998 if they continue to harbor criminals the operations will continue we will place them under the rule of law if they refuse to surrender these commanders this means that they are tolerating them
6996999 definitely with our troops on the ground we expect more skirmishes
6997000 considering that they milf are still there as intelligence shows we anticipate some armed confrontations in the next few days
6997001 we do not want to give a deadline but as much as possible we do not want to prolong the fight because it is not good for the general public the shorter we can make these operations last the better

6997044 canada and several other western governments have recently blacklisted the liberation tigers of tamil eelam as a terrorist group but the focus of many toronto tamils is on alleged acts of
6997045 the show will make a distinction between tamil nationalism and the tamil tigers who claim to be the only standard bearers of the cause the stand has some support but not everyone agrees
6997046 i hate the tamil community here the way they support the terrorists

6997085 of course it was not the same spectacle as it would have been with an evening kick off today it was very hot and the players felt it
6997086 but im happy that i was able to get the ball in and that in the end we got what we wanted

6997125 torontos luxury condominium market is a bargain compared to other international cities even though the quality of the product is comparable
6997126 toronto is more affordable to more people than any other international city which is what makes it so unique look at any other city on the world list and there is no way young professionals who have bought condos in downtown toronto could afford to own something comparable in any other city
6997127 it seems unlikely that canada will come out of it totally unscathed
6997128 the new build market typically takes a hit first in a bad economy
6997129 one reason is because theyre built in blocks with developers going to market with hundreds of units when you have this large a volume basic economics says prices must come down so whether youre super rich or not its a riskier proposition
6997130 toronto doesnt really have a super high end when you compare us to other countries we dont cut it
6997131 what we consider the top end is the starting point for other countries
6997132 i guess its all relative i grew up in london ontario and then when i moved to toronto i thought prices were high there too but you have this critical mass of extremely wealthy people who want to live in london because it is a financial and cultural capital
6997133 is a very important second tier city just below centres that are truly global but it doesnt have the size or scale of the other areas
6997134 we found out that wall street has been king of a nudist beach
6997135 theyre looking for help obviously and the scale of help is such that i dont think it can come from the private sector
6997136 what well see is failures where the bankers were dumb in what they did
6997137 it seems peculiar to me that sun would condescend to allow scotia to have say a 35 per cent interest
6997138 scotia is the weakest in the mutual fund business so they are trying a number of ways to augment their wealth management sector
6997139 it would seem more likely to me that sun would buy more of ci or if theyre prohibited from doing that because of some standstill agreement then i think they would talk to ci on a friendly basis
6997140 weve entered a period of quite acute weakness thats unlikely to be short lived

6997142 the acquisition of pbs will help ensure that severstal controls its operating costs by providing a guaranteed supply of metallurgical coal for our coke making operations in the u s

6997144 our insurance company had a profit of 441 million dollars last year alone
6997145 they have fought paying expenses for my mother with vigour at every step of the way their input can only be described in my opinion as cruel intimidating inhumane inadequate and unfair
6997146 the distress they put us through was the worst aspect of this entire ordeal and at all times they were only following the process to the finest degree put in place by your department
6997147 claim costs per vehicle for all coverages reached 1 034 in 2007 for a total increase of 18 per cent from 879 reported for 2004
6997148 in the absence of reforms to reduce cost pressures average premiums in 2009 would need to be about 18 per cent higher than their average level during the second half of 2007 thus wiping out well more than all of the affordability gains to consumers that have been realized since the fall of 2003

6997152 as soon as he stepped out of the car he went after one of the officers
6997153 the officer came in covered in mud cause once they got him there was a bit of a wrestling match trying to hold him down
6997154 he was in those lanes and i guess didnt want to get off at the don valley parkway so he made the evasive move at the last moment and lost control
6997155 witnesses have told us that the vehicle was travelling at high speeds just prior to the crash
6997156 i knew they would win i knew they would get the world record
6997157 sure i would be nervous but i would try to remain calm
6997158 i think they are congenitally nervous because we lost a bunch of presidential elections where people felt that we should have won
6997159 the republicans have been and will do whatever they can say whatever they feel they need to to try to hold on to power
6997160 its happening again john mccain has turned his campaign over to karl roves henchmen and across the country democrats are being subjected to lies and smears
6997161 he has to become more of a person and less of a personality
6997162 he needs to be somebody voters can warm up to and share an emotional commitment
6997163 the polls show he is ahead of mccain when it comes to shared values with american voters he has to use that to his advantage
6997164 if they worry about his race there is nothing he can do about it
6997165 history will tell you that when there is conflict at a convention that party has lost americans dont like that
6997166 he is trying to avoid conflict by inviting hillary and bill clinton into prominent speaking positions so if there is conflict it will be contained to a minority of hillary clinton supporters and i dont think it will have an effect
6997167 he cant do that without risking alienating some white voters
6997168 when he speaks to blacks he talks of personal responsibility and moral issues
6997169 but then in front of whites he talks about economic policy
6997170 that is not to say genes are not important but there are no race exclusive genes to explain this phenomenon
6997171 if i had a million dollars i would resolve this issue for good
6997172 id put the stereotypical view of the natural black athlete or indeed the intellectually superior white to rest
6997173 its looking like there is some genetic component to performance but its not race linked
6997174 these people their high performance centre is in high altitude in kenya
6997175 here its an environment that says we are terrific sprinters so lets have a system where lots of kids participate we identify good ones and theyre celebrated and they continue on with that
6997176 all the articles coming out now mention the unchallenged understanding that genetics plays a significant role in shaping body types
6997177 and athletes of west african ancestry definitely have an edge in the sprints and certain other sports in which quick burst running and jumping are key were all born different and were born different by patterns different populations around the world have evolved facing different kinds of environmental and cultural challenges that have shaped how they develop
6997178 genetically based anatomical differences help explain why athletes of primarily west african ancestry hold 97 per cent of top sprint times
6997179 including 494 of the top 500 100 metre times yet are not very good at endurance sports which requires a much different physiology
6997180 the body type of whites falls in between west african descended and east african athletes they have more natural upper body strength which contributes to their domination of weightlifting field events such as the shot put and hammer whites hold 46 of the top 50 throws and the offensive line in football where flexibility is key east asians shine such as in diving and some skating and gymnastic events
6997181 fast men have a special component called actinen a in their fast twitch muscles which determine whether humans are sprinters or plodders
6997182 theres a lot of serendipity pure luck at work here with the confluence of so many jamaican runners sprinters right now at future olympics youre going to see runners distributed through people of west african ancestry distributed through different populations whether its other caribbean communities or the u s or canada france britain whatever again its serendipity you see such a high concentration of jamaicans
6997183 athletic competition offers a definitiveness that eludes most other aspects of life
6997184 this is of course dangerous territory fascination about black physicality and black anger about being caricatured as a lesser human being have been part of the dark side of the american dialogue on race for more than a century
6997185 the actn3 centred argument dismisses the importance of jamaicas impressive investment in the infrastructure and training system required to identify and nurture elite track athletes the effects of a culture that idolizes local track heroes and the powerful desire of young jamaicans to use athletic success to lift themselves and their families out of poverty
6997186 we needed red twitch fibres 100 000 years ago to give us the ability to walk long long distances from one berry area to another one
6997187 and we also needed the fast twitch fibres because you either had to run away from an animal or get after it to catch it
6997188 you find white guys with lots of fast twitch fibres and youll find also white guys who can run a long time
6997189 yes you need the talent no doubt about it body size muscle fibre composition and such things
6997190 the timing of course is simply the timing of when the agreement was completed
6997191 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
6997192 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
6997193 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats
6997194 every generation there are changes in peoples relationship with government
6997195 government should do more especially when youre spending tens of billions of dollars in iraq protecting the interests of millionaires
6997196 weve got to revoke the tax cuts for the wealthy
6997197 we definitely need to do something more for the economically disadvantaged weve allowed big corporations to take millions for corporate leaders while workers get nothing
6997198 during the era when bill clinton was president there was a clear re centering of the party
6997199 there is a growing understanding that government can play a positive role in investing in our country
6997200 enormous dissatisfaction with the republican party has brought out the base more
6997201 the rise of the internet and bloggers have made the party more progressive
6997202 by 1980 the average person said i dont need government anymore
6997203 the whole world changes and people feel a little bit at sea and they need help

6997207 mr blair made intoxicating speeches in the mid 1990s that seemed to develop an argument when he was actually avoiding one mr osborne follows a similar path
6997208 like some of his other senior colleagues mr osborne has read the new labour manuals assiduously and probably knows off by heart the speeches delivered by blair and brown en route to their 1997 landslide they declared that the new divide in the mid 1990s was not between high and low taxation but fair and unfair taxation it sounded like a moment of definitive change but what did they mean by fair and unfair tax what did they regard as levels that were too high an apparently defining argument hid a thousand more important debates mr blair opened the door to mr osborne in other ways too towards the end of his leadership he argued labour had become too obsessed about the means in politics rather than the ends but it is the means that are the cause of the divide between parties mrs thatcher argued that her policies produced fairer outcomes compared with labour the arguments were over the means no party claims that it wants an unfair society in suggesting that the means are unimportant mr blair gave the conservatives the freedom to argue that their approach is progressive because they seek fair outcomes every politician in britain seeks fairer outcomes one of the reasons why mr osbornes speech is politically clever also relates to mr blair the ultra blairites will agree with every word the vaguely defined means as well as the ends that no one would disagree about out of genuine conviction as much as pragmatism the heirs to blair cameron and osborne cause mayhem in the labour party whether revisiting the politics of the mid 1990s is a successful route to power is another matter

6997216 in an effort to clean up emissions of all motorised vehicles the eu government has set a number of standards to be met within certain deadlines
6997217 the vespa px will undoubtedly go down in history as one of the best a model does not last for 30 years unless it was right in the first place
6997218 my generation has grown up with the px it was designed and created in 1977 when i was eight so ive known nothing else
6997219 it mobilised the masses again in the 80s you had the jam quadrophenia and the mod revival and the px was sitting there in the showroom
6997220 there were thousands of scooters on the roads again you could buy it on hire purchase it was style you could afford thirty years on people were still buying it
6997221 you could say it was the vw beetle of the two wheeled world
6997222 its a shame really because its the end of a long line of motor scooters its the end of the true blood line
6997223 there are new vespas out there the company created the scooter 60 years ago and is still making a version of it
6997224 so you can still go out and buy a stylish scooter but what you cant buy is the last piece of the history
6997225 its like the new fiat 500 the style is there but its just not quite the same which is a shame as the vespa px is a design classic
6997226 the modern scooter rider requires ease of use as one of its main priorities for scootering around and a twist and go machine provides that easy driving style
6997227 the px had a manual gearbox that was born out of its traditional heritage as opposed to what todays customer demands

6997453 sie wird nicht v llig anders aussehen aber die neukonstruktion ist darauf ausgelegt uns weiterhin gute punkte zu bescheren es ist sehr schwer eine gute maschine noch weiter zu verbessern wir sind schon jetzt auf der bremse sehr stabil und auch am kurvenausgang verh lt sie sich sehr gut
6997454 wir wollen an den achillesfersen die wir so haben einige gro e fortschritte unternehmen das erfordert ein neues motorrad in bezug auf chassisdesign motorlage und das layout des bikes
6997455 bridgestone hilft uns auf diesem gebiet sehr viel aber wir m ssen das einlenk und kurvenverhalten verbessern
6997456 ich denke dass beide fahrer die jungs im werk dr ngen werden das neue chassis in misano verwenden zu d rfen es sind aber noch signifikant wenig ersatzteile da ein gr erer unfall w rde bedeuten dass man auf die aktuellen maschinen zur ckgreifen muss
6997457 wir w rden ein altes und ein neues chassis mitnehmen m ssen aber suzuki muss das noch berdenken falls alles gut klappt k nnten sie in sachen ersatzteillager bis indianapolis aufholen
6997458 es ist ein fr her prototyp f r 2009 und es ist m glich dass wir damit sofern das feedback gut ist und es ein deutlicher schritt nach vorne ist den rest des jahres bestreiten es ist m glich aber sehr unwahrscheinlich eben aufgrund der verf gbarkeit von ersatzteilen und solchen sachen aber suzuki w rde alles tun um es zu erm glichen falls es die sache wert ist

6997482 korea was a turning point for seol he went back there and realised what a big star he is in the country
6997483 i wasnt surprised at how big he was in korea hes a good looking boy who was a world cup star in a football mad country
6997484 but hes very well perceived over there despite the fact he hasnt made the grade in the premiership yet
6997485 you cant put that down to managers like lawrie sanchez and myself not giving him opportunities at this level you dont get many chances
6997486 if you get an opportunity and it doesnt work out for you at a place where the competition for places is strong you run the risk of not getting another chance
6997487 during the time i sat out i kept thinking and asking myself whether i would have the legs to continue playing football given my age and present physical condition
6997488 with these in mind i decided way before the test that 2008 would be my final year as a player
6997489 forwards like myself tend to rely on quick bursts of speed over various distances to get past the defenders rather than continuous athletic running over the duration of the game
6997490 as always i have been confident on the pitch and feel i can deliver when called upon by the club
6997491 this season had i passed i could have fulfilled my target of 12 goals in their remaining league games
6997492 sure i was sad i am not able to pass this time but i am happy that it is all over
6997493 i was a bag of nerves before the test because as much as i had practiced i was unsure when the aches and niggles would turn up and affect my run
6997494 each time i did not succeed it became harder to train well and improve as i had to rest two to three days to allow the affected muscles to recover before resuming training
6997495 i have been suffering from my right ligament and right shin splints injuries for a while it has been difficult as i put myself on painkillers and had to do more stretches to get myself ready for the test
6997496 now no more painkillers no more stress i feel happy and relieved
6997497 recu rdanos parecen decir estas ltimas banderas con cierto orgullo popular chino no nos olvides
6997498 what the photographs herein reveal is that china is not just one place one people but 33 distinct regions populated by 56 different ethnicities each with their own languages customs and lifestyles
6997499 it is my most sincere hope that this book unites the people immortalized in its pages tibetan pilgrims and beijing scholars uyghur muslims and shanghai bankers hong kong millionaires and shanxi miners in celebration of their glorious cultures
6997500 tom carter is an extraordinary photographer whose powerful work captures the heart and soul of the chinese people
6997501 couldnt claim any major legislative victories during his tenure as chairman concerning indian country
6997502 he put forward a piece of legislation that would have added more burdensome regulation to our gaming industry at a time when our federal funding was at its lowest point
6997503 we were very disappointed because weve had a long history with sen mccain and i know that if he personally had gotten the message he might have met with us but we couldnt get to him
6997504 sen obamas going to have to meet with tribes on a daily basis to catch up with the 25 years sen mccain has spent on their issues
6997505 i dont think theres anything that even looks like a horse race in terms of intimacy of association and familiarity with the issues
6997506 they like him they want to give him a chance but its a big big job they need some reassurances that hes up to it
6997507 hes not one whos going to shoot from the hip
6997508 i think the personal character is more important than the experience
6997509 its a very complicated job with a lot of pieces that are constantly moving on you
6997510 if the campaign is disorganized and the candidate is disorganized that might be an indication they cant put a white house together
6997511 his experience is certainly not something you would look at and say this is who i want to be leader of the free world
6997512 get off my bus right now good you want to move slow get on my bus right now
6997513 the lesson here if you want to own the story probably best to jump on the send button once the msm surrounds your super secret vp choices house with camera crews
6997514 were just at the cusp of being able to create the actors the heroes and the stars of the film using computer graphics as well
6997515 it captures not only the shape of your face but the way light interacts with your face from every angle
6997516 we have the ability right now to bring the emotions off of a performance that somebody just does on video
6997517 if necessary a very good animator can actually move the mouth and eyes around to give a great performance as well
6997518 they are effectively the puppeteer of one of these photo reel digital actors
6997519 this combination of technologies is just at the brink where in the next couple of years well see it really work and were all going to be pretty amazed by it
6997520 you go through the entire script with digital props and car crashes with digital robots says tracy mcsheery an engineer with phasespace a company that specialises in motion capture systems
6997521 you can show it to test audiences and vet the entire production to make sure that its exactly what you want before you spend the million of dollars and months of time and then find out it didnt quite have the look or feel that you were hoping for
6997522 theres totally the possibility that you can create something that never existed that becomes a popular star of motion picture
6997523 this has been done with mickey mouse to begin with and bugs bunny and all of these animated characters the only change now is that theyll be able to look like real people instead of cartoon characters
6997524 the best most powerful and most easily programmed computer in the world is the one between our ears
6997525 for a while yet the cheapest way to make movies will be for real people to follow the directions of the director sure cgi effects are cool and will advance a lot as the years pass but actors will be with us a long while yet

6997530 all the filming was done in america ive been back and fore as ive discovered more people who knew gareth
6997531 apart from the serious film buffs most people will not have heard of him but during his 10 15 year stretch as a film actor he was a major star with the studios earning 2 000 a week
6997532 he had all the trappings two houses a stables home help everything you imagine the stars have today
6997533 he came from a working class family in dafen and walked all the way to london he would have been 16 or 17 years old to be an actor on the stage
6997534 he joined a group of welsh players who went over to the states and although they were not successful and came back he remained behind
6997535 his career just took off because he was very successful on the stage in broadway in new york and there he was obviously seen by the right people and persuaded to get involved in the new fangled picture business
6997536 he made 45 films melodramas comedies he was part of the studio stable so did what ever they wanted him to do
6997537 i think it was a choice on his behalf to leave the business
6997538 we had a great program even without 21st century but this will give us money for more personnel and it gives us a chance to provide meals and rides home
6997539 more than half of our student population is on free and reduced lunch
6997540 our district doesnt have a lot of racial diversity but it does have a lot of socioeconomic diversity and a lot of kids arent able to seek out activities
6997541 i have parents calling me and asking me whats the catch
6997542 well there is no catch you get these great programs for free
6997543 thats his big weapon and he doesnt have it so he is in the bullpen
6997544 skips got a job to do and has to make the best decision for the team
6997545 he cant feel good about putting me out there with what happened in texas i dont feel good about going out with what happened in texas
6997546 as we speak today the answer is 100 percent no
6997547 its not the right thing to do and general manager dave dombrowski agrees with it
6997548 i think theres always pressure but maybe more with this group because of the back to back titles
6997549 now people will say you did it then with most of the same girls and can do it again theyll see we have seven kids from last years team and we lose three but its not that way there are different personalities and different chemistry and people will have to step up
6997550 its always special but i feel bad for them because theres a lot of pressure on them
6997551 its like the coachs daughter i feel like they are my daughters too i enjoy it but there is a lot of pressure on them
6997552 i look for us to start a bit slow as we have some young hitters and progress to an extremely competitive level by seasons end
6997553 we have a team with a lot of potential and our growth will depend on our desire to work hard and improve
6997554 the girls came into the gym eager and ready to accomplish their goals the team is determined to win the city tournament and district again as well as finishing strong in the league these girls are enthusiastic and raring to go i am looking forward to helping them to achieve their goals
6997555 as a group we have the talent to do some special things
6997556 last year we just lacked some experience we were really young in key positions after some good summer ball and some good preseason work i am looking forward to see how we stack up
6997557 we are looking to improve our game in all phases of play
6997558 i feel this team can contend for a league title in the scaa
6997559 our goal for the season will be the same as it has been every year win a state title
6997560 we have a great group of athletes that are working very hard to improve and play good volleyball
6997561 with eight returning lettermen plus talented new players we are very optimistic for a very special season
6997562 we are not very tall but quite athletic how we come together as a team will determine how far we go
6997563 were in a new league this year and its going to be tough but i think well be competitive
6997564 we have strong hitters and servers so we should be able to score points that way were going to come out strong and try to prove we can be a challenge
6997565 our success will depend upon how we can pass the serve and play defense those have been areas of focus during our summer training
6997566 we look to be the spoiler in our conference this year
6997567 the girls are undergoing a lot of jump training to be a better attacking and blocking team there are some new teams in our conference and i look for the conference to be more difficult than last year this year passing will be key we pass well everything else will follow
6997568 we have a strong group of athletes who have a true love of the game and are open to running unorthodox offenses to utilize each athletes strength
6997569 we should have our best team in the schools history
6997570 we are very strong in the setting and ball control areas our attacking has improved at every position our blocking and middle play is a concern due to size and inexperience we will not be a easy match for anyone
6997571 with our girls basketball team making it to the state finals and our girls softball team being state champions we are definitely feeling the pressure to be successful
6997572 hopefully this pressure will motivate us to work harder than we ever have in the past i have a great group of girls who seem to respect and care about one another tremendously so im counting on them to push one another to their limits and challenge one another each and every day
6997573 i expect us to be at the top part of our league with our size and speed with the big eight you have a tough night with anybody youre playing i believe our leadership and teamwork will come together and win some games for us
6997574 we hope to improve in the league with a very young team
6997575 we have five new players who have not played with their new teammates in several years this will be an obstacle to overcome to ensure that our team chemistry is positive and everyone becomes comfortable playing with each other we have a lot of great talent but need to just put it all together
6997576 we havent been able to square up with any teams yet so im not sure where were at
6997577 the carrie adams tournament will be a measuring stick for us if we can get the ball up to our attackers we can play with anybody league wise id say were in the hunt
6997578 with only four returners from last season the girls are working hard to form a winning team chemistry
6997579 our success will be determined by how well the younger kids come along we have two setters that are only freshmen as their skills and confidence get stronger our hitters will be more effective im hoping by mid season were a much more competitive team
6997580 weve shown we can lay on fantastic sporting events britain has invented or codified virtually every major sport
6997581 i think it would be wonderful for london if we held the rugby world cup in 2015
6997582 do everything in our power to bring the world cup to england in 2015
6997583 i played against the guys in practice so it will be fun to compete against them in a different setting
6997584 i talk to guys all the time check on them see how camps treating them
6997585 everybody seems to be doing well i wish those guys the best
6997586 shaun is an outstanding football player his ability size and athleticism for a guy that big is special
6997587 we lost a big part of the middle of our defense

6997601 they like him they want to give him a chance but its a big big job they need some reassurances that hes up to it
6997602 hes not one whos going to shoot from the hip
6997603 i think the personal character is more important than the experience
6997604 its a very complicated job with a lot of pieces that are constantly moving on you

6997609 het is economisch riskant dat we zoveel schuld hebben en dat andere landen deze op zich nemen ik ken mijn geschiedenis anderen vergaren zo gigantische politieke macht en we zouden ze niet moeten vertrouwen
6997610 ik zie het nog niet als buitengewoon alarmerend maar de groei moet niet doorzetten op termijn zou dat politiek gezien tot instabiliteit kunnen leiden er zouden wat demagogen kunnen opkomen

6997627 this partnership has been fantastic the museum has been able to expand the current collection of fascinating tlicho artefacts and gained a greater knowledge of the objects the exhibition has also been an inspiration to the tlicho community encouraging them to revive and celebrate traditional styles
6997628 we are trying to stay faithful to our culture whilst also integrating into modern canadian society this is why the national museums collection became of interest it provides a material link to our past

6997644 one of the proposals being looked at is a card for those who want to work here that would be good for lets say three to five years
6997645 thered be some sort of biometric identification and a background check to make sure theyre not a criminal
6997646 if they want to become a citizen they can apply for a green card signifying permanent resident status and go through the process
6997647 i think that i am responsible for some conduct that has caused damage to the system to my office
6997648 i hope ive conveyed to the court that i feel badly
6997649 if there is a silver lining it is that ive become a better lawyer
6997650 i think a lot of stuff caught up with him
6997651 immigration judges should have the tools necessary to control their courtrooms and protect the adjudicatory system from fraud and abuse
6997652 this proposed rule seeks to preserve the fairness and integrity of immigration proceedings and increase the level of protection afforded to aliens in those proceedings
6997653 when did a cancer diagnosis become fit for tv viewing
6997654 we are talking about a human being here not a cartoon character or a cash cow
6997655 there really has to be an end to the celebration of stupidity and ignorance
6997656 i cant face telling my boys because they are so young they think mummy has a tummy ache
6997657 they really are coming up with some corkers at syndicalist central at the moment
6997658 this issue is as important or more important to the latino community than the presidential race
6997659 its a real core value for latinos theres no question about that
6997660 for those who vote which is a subset of the latino community youre likely to find support for the proposition opposing gay marriage but those sorts of moral issues do not motivate latinos to participate
6997661 i just dont know if the number of latino voters will be enough to put it the gay marriage ban over the top
6997662 the extent to which the republican party cares about their issues beyond just abortion and gay marriage
6997663 its the same core message that traditional marriage is the cornerstone of our society
6997664 the california supreme court chose to look at it strictly as a legal contract between party a and party b that is not just myopic its potentially devastating to families and society
6997665 i think its because everyone is so culturally catholic who is latino
6997666 i think thats one thing that kind of permeates every latino society
6997667 i think its the way we were raised its so catholic and there are set rules the way things are supposed to be
6997668 but i wouldnt say i agree with it just because of how i was raised
6997669 its like any bank you put money in then take it out when you need it
6997670 projects like semitropic are part of an absolute explosion in new water storage that weve seen in the last 15 years
6997671 we have all this water in wet years that we cant use
6997672 the important thing for us is how can we level it out and have a water supply that will be available for us in dry years we had to find some place to put it so we could use it later
6997673 its a good value and i feel really good about where we are
6997674 in places like kern county where they have been doing this for years they have worked out agreements with their neighbors as to how fast theyll draw water out
6997675 they are pretty sophisticated but in other areas these concerns still have to be solved
6997676 the electronic systems which guarantee our safety have been jammed and scrambled
6997677 we are civilians from 17 nations on this project to break the siege of gaza we are not experienced sailors
6997678 we are following the development and if they are looking for a provocation we will know how to avoid it
6997679 i brought the kids so if they the activists arrive i can tell them welcome and thank you for not forgetting us
6997680 nobody thinks that these boats will break the siege in a practical way but this is a moral message what is happening in gaza is illegal and inhumane and must be halted
6997681 it took me forever to get my portfolio to the point where it was making a steady flow of cash but once it was i knew that sustaining this cash flow would be an entirely new challenge luckily for me i successfully reinvested middle eastern gaming policy marketing dividends and was able to capitalize on a strong bull market
6997682 i started out following all the zany and crazy ideas i could find that promised a quick buck
6997683 frankly one can get rid of the element of chance by doing good research
6997684 i personally spend at least 2 hours a day researching middle eastern gaming policy trends and buying activity while watching the latest sell reports from vanwinkle valone investment firm inc
6997685 look this isnt some 30 second sound byte promising you a life of wealth and luxury without any work you have to work hard in this middle eastern gaming policy field and that is the only way to become a success
6997686 you dont have to be a millionaire to make cash when dealing with middle eastern gaming policy securities
6997687 most successful traders start with as little as one thousand dollars and slowly build from there
6997688 as a middle eastern gaming policy tax consultant i always recommend disciplined record keeping it is the only way to be sure that you can get the most out of your middle eastern gaming policy capital investments while at the same time saving money on what you owe uncle sam

6997705 the americans who uprooted the sulu sultanate 90 years ago are coming back to install the sultanate
6997706 they are here to advance their protection of oil fields and shipping lanes thats why the sultan of sulu is pro balikatan balikatan literally shoulder to shoulder joint philippine exercises with us soldiers thats why malaysia is scared of the american presence here

6997708 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
6997709 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
6997710 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats

6997714 i couldnt tear myself away from 3 quarks daily to the point of neglecting my work congratulations on this superb site
6997715 i have placed 3 quarks daily at the head of my list of web bookmarks
6997716 just wanted you to know im one of many who reads and enjoys 3 quarks almost daily
6997717 holy hell at my place this is like 6 and its 2 15 here what the o o
6997718 i have been keeping my head down these last few days the aldare woman worries me as she brings trouble to every single thing she touches i felt it best to make myself less visible
6997719 by now the dock at dalk will be unusable and the steam dragon will be diverted to dock in tallis
6997720 the way you speak you did not obtain that information from the captain did you this diversion was planned from the very beginning
6997721 it does not matter when it was planned getting the sword through dalk was always going to be practically impossible this way we will already be in our home territory before we have to land a single one of them
6997722 and we will have the boat company at our throats
6997723 this is not the sort of thing that oto would do he has far too much sense this is the kind of madness that someone like maximus would engage in we work for oto tallis and not his upstart brother i would remind you
6997724 i work first for the sorn family and second for the house of tallis
6997725 you will do exactly as you have been ordered remember your role here is to represent the house of tallis and to make sure the swords get to them and to them alone
6997726 your father would never work for or with maximus and this is your fathers operation in the end gally sorn from what i know of deren sorn if you are planning to cross him you will wish you had never been born for a long long time before you finally die
6997727 leave my father out of this and follow your orders
6997728 the dock is little more than a stone wall on the south side of the river bratin will have lights all along the dock for us as we are very important for them there will also be men ready to help the steam dragon dock
6997729 we will take a large cargo of fruit up to slarn the three sister boats take fruit from bratin to slarn throughout the year even in mid winter if there is a suitable period of weather one of the boats will make the journey to bratin and back
6997730 wouldnt it be more sensible to take the fruit up before the bad weather sets in
6997731 we wont be able to see it tonight because it will be too dark but it is a massive dome of glass half a mile in diameter
6997732 it is made up of thousands of large hexagonal pieces of glass that have been braced in steel but it is a truly awesome sight if you have never seen it before
6997733 they say that the trees and bushes within it are all that remains of the lush forests that became the atribar eldou desert
6997734 according to legend the magician king of slarn imported the fruit trees because he was so fond of the taste of the fruit they say he had the dome constructed so that the trees would flourish in these northern climes the fruit is very perishable and could not be imported up the river slarn because it would take far too long at least that is what the story says
6997735 there is a hot spring below bratin and its waters are piped all through the dome that was the reason the king chose bratin rather than building the greenhouse in slarn
6997736 even jalia will find it difficult to find trouble in bratin
6997737 it is a place with nothing of interest in it and is intensely boring at the best of times
6997738 and i thought i knew all the landmarks between boathaven and slarn
6997739 its in the courtyard of the governors mansion and most people think its a boring looking sculpture
6997740 bratin is close enough to slarn that it has always been considered to be part of its territory
6997741 even though its still four days away by boat the king of slarn appoints a governor to look after the people here in reality it is always a man or woman from bratin so no one here minds the arrangement very much
6997742 the clock is encased in a solid glass cylinder which is ten feet high and three feet in diameter it used to keep perfect time according to legend then the last high king died and it stopped according to some prophet or other it will start again to herald the return of the high king at least i think that what i was told
6997743 come to think of it i think we should all go to see it
6997744 i cant see any harm in going to see it
6997745 he sido un testigo y estas fotos son mi testimonio los hechos que he registrado no deber an olvidarse y no deben repetirse

6997752 the great thing about joe biden during the alito hearings the reason he is to me actually endearing is that as he speaks as he goes on and on and spins his long statements hypotheticals and free associations as he demonstrates yet again as he did in the roberts hearings and even the thomas hearings that he is incapable of staying on the river of a thought and is constantly lured down tributaries from which he can never quite work his way back you can see him batting the little paddles of his mind against the weeds trying desperately to return to the river but not remembering where it is or where it was going i love him hes human like a garrulous uncle after a drink
6997753 well i hope you dont still hold that view man

6997757 we appeal to russia to be the first country from the international community to recognize the independence of the republic of south ossetia

6997766 the chance came at the right moment this is a club with a lot of ambition
6997767 that helped me make my decision and i am looking forward to playing in the premier league
6997768 i just had a good feeling about this move when you feel they are dynamic people at city who know a lot about football you realise you are in a good environment to improve your game
6997769 i have been through a lot of things already playing big games in front of big crowds so i do not think it will be a problem adapting
6997770 the higher the level the more challenges are put in front of you the season in the premier league is long and you need everyone i just want to help the team that is what it is all about
6997771 we keep on telling everyone there is not a financial situation here and no constraints
6997772 some people are putting out a lot of negativity about the club that will change once we start winning games people will then concentrate on football which is the most important thing

6997799 we know that he had extended contact with the girl whos now 16
6997800 our concern is there may be additional victims because he clearly has no qualms about contacting girls who are significantly underage
6997801 we are very confident that hes the individual that savagely sexually assaulted this woman over the weekend
6997802 this would not have been solved if it werent for the poise of the victim the perseverance of the community providing us with tips and the investigative work of the investigative team
6997803 we are following the development and if they are looking for a provocation we will know how to avoid it
6997804 i brought the kids so if they the activists arrive i can tell them welcome and thank you for not forgetting us

6997811 television needs regulators just as roads need traffic wardens but you wouldnt ask your traffic warden to give you advice on what sort of car to buy still less how to drive it
6997812 lets scrap saturday nights completely dramas out and comedy too no role for sport the champions league final euro 2008 the olympics the 14 million people who tuned into the final of britains got talent werent there to be entertained but to watch tv promote understanding of religions culture and lifestyles
6997813 trust audiences and trust their tastes and you wont come unstuck
6997814 i worry that weve lost sight of what makes programmes worth watching in the first place creativity imagination invention
6997815 that television is there to delight to surprise and to inspire above all to enjoy its not a branch of the education service wrap it up in the woolly words of political correctness and the short term illusion of warmth will soon give way to the reality of suffocation
6997816 this echoes what weve heard for years and years in the health care system
6997817 it also points out something really key for the provincial government the biggest problem bar none is shortages
6997818 whats notable is that people have unrealistic notions of what it would cost to pay for treatment abroad
6997819 the actual costs for catastrophic health care the only kind youd really want to pay for are out of the means of three quarters of ontarians
6997820 its just that now well be starting again getting a new relationship with new doctors
6997821 we could have at least been on a waiting list at another clinic during this time
6997822 they know you by name and they know a little bit about what youve gone through and to start from scratch again would be a lot of stress

6997834 hay un miedo que subyace y es que se repita lo que pas con el yak 42
6997835 sabemos que todo esto est dentro de un proceso judicial respetamos eso y entendemos y queremos que el proceso se haga con toda la seguridad pertinente tenemos conocimiento de que es as como lo tienen que hacer pero hay un miedo que subyace que es que se repita lo que pas con el yak 42 as que queremos que la identificaci n se haga con toda la seguridad jur dica que se debe
6997836 m s contundente y la primera en la que dieron informaci n clara y precisa
6997837 dijeron que lo va a organizar protecci n civil y estar en el hotel as que no tendremos que movernos tambi n podemos ir a la almudena pero all no hay ning n sitio de atenci n a los afectados ni siquiera hay para sentarse as que lo mejor es que la informaci n vierta del hotel
6997838 50 de las 103 personas que faltan por identificar son los que no estaban reconocibles los que no se pudieron usar sus huellas dactilares y esas cosas as que hay que usar el adn y eso implica un m nimo de 48 horas
6997839 un parte no con nombres pero s diciendo cu ntas personas van identificando para dar resultados
6997840 as iremos viendo que la cosa avanza y que todo lo que nos dicen de palabra funciona

6997857 claro que me satisface dos medallas de plata no se ganan todos los d as
6997858 el ruso estuvo muy fuerte y al final consigui la victoria
6997859 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6997860 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6997861 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6997862 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6997863 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6997864 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6997865 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6997866 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6997867 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6997868 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6997869 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6997870 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6997871 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6997872 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6997873 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible

6997878 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6997879 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6997880 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6997881 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6997882 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6997883 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6997884 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6997885 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6997886 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6997887 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s

6997889 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6997890 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6997891 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6997892 as we have succeeded in providing top quality dedicated server hosting services we have significantly improved our pricing policy as the result this is a great news for all our hosting customers and of course bad news for our competitors as we provide the most successful combination of the best quality hosting services with attractive prices
6997893 the prices for our high performance dedicated servers on international hosting market are so competitive that i can say without any doubt that our prices have left no chances for our competitors in the same time the quality of our hosting services is continually increasing and the performance of our dedicated server network is being improved all the time
6997894 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6997895 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6997896 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6997897 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6997898 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6997899 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6997900 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6997901 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6997902 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6997903 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6997904 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6997905 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6997906 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6997907 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6997908 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6997909 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6997910 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6997911 education alerts is a way without being overly intrusive to interact with students who may not remember us very well and it gets them back into thinking about our school
6997912 education alerts identifies and contacts prospects that previously showed interest and rekindles interest without overextending our marketing department as a result weve captured a much larger percentage of students who we originally deemed as losses
6997913 while most career school owners presidents and marketing directors understand the value of recycling their inactive student leads few have the internal resources to mine the gold in their prospect databases
6997914 as the cost to keep the student lead pipeline full with quality student leads continues to increase across all media broadcast print and search engine advertising its critical for schools to recycle their inactive student leads thats where education alerts fits into a schools lead generation strategy

6997919 hundreds of thousands of bacteria on hot spots like a printer button and the button for the first floor in the elevator touched by hundreds of fingers each day even though none of the bacteria gerba found was life threatening they could lead to more colds and flu
6997920 among the bacteria was coli form intestinal bacteria generally found in human waste on the restroom handles and faucets in the kitchen sink and sponge and even in the candy basket
6997921 sneezes and coughs produce particles that once evaporated will turn into a dried residue called droplet nuclei this residue which can last in the air for hours may then transfer infection through the respiratory tract

6997936 in the last 6 olympic games there is an average 19 12 increase in the hosting countries stock indexes in the six months following the games in the 12 month after the olympics the stock indexes had a strong 26 14 average increase
6997937 these factors caused the increase on the stock market 6 months after the sporting event
6997938 the infrastructure construction system establishment and environmental protection among others for the olympics gave a lasting boost to the hosting countries economy therefore although gdp growth in those hosting countries showed a certain degree of slow down generally speaking the hosting countries economy maintained a relatively high speed of growth whats more the reduction of bubbles in the post olympics capital market has typically ensured steady and benign growth history clearing indicates that the lasting winner of the beijing olympics will be the beijing economy
6997939 the enormous changes that took place in china over the past 30 years have given people of the world more imagination and expectation about china

6997945 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6997946 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6997947 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6997948 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre

6997950 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6997951 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6997952 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6997953 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6997954 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6997955 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6997956 the financial service firms using either third party or captive options for support tend towards hiring loyal dedicated individuals with sustained professional experience these hires will have worked for each firm for a minimum of 3 5 years progressing through the ranks it is here a firm finds employees with whom their ip intellectual property can be most trusted
6997957 the maxim that people buy people is hugely relevant we are much more likely to place long term repeat business with suppliers who deliver a consistent experienced team such stability leads to more business more profit more responsibility and more satisfaction everybody wins

6997971 we are suspecting some more militant are hiding in the area the operation still continues
6997972 and arrangement for as many as two thousand people to sleep
6997973 they are much bigger because they have been doing this for 17 years
6997974 they extort money in baltal by charging as much as five thousand ruppes a day for a tent
6997975 but 90 pilgrims walk the difficulty of the trek is part of the pilgrimage
6997976 india can build large dams but not even a road up the mountain
6997977 until 1990 a very small number of pilgrims used to go
6997978 but in 1991 murli manohar joshi came with a large number of people in a convoy and went to the cave and put up a bjp flag at lal chowk in srinagar and proceeded to the amarnath cave thats the point when the number of yatris started increasing
6997979 double provocation one to tell the people of kashmir that you cant take the valley from india and two to tell militants that we are not afraid of you
6997980 in any case his continuation as ceo of the board was against deputation rules
6997981 and what is the need for langars langars are not part of the hindu tradition
6997982 the main reason for increase in number of yatris is langars free food and accomodation some also offer free bus service from jammu and the media has played a very big role in popularizing the amarnath yatra
6997983 they charge twenty five thousand rupees and dont provide half of the services they promise
6997984 but then why did the government go to the supreme court for permission for building the mughal road which connects kashmir with jammus muslim dominated districts whereas all government departments ruled that they didnt need to do the same for the baltal land
6997985 we got scared when the shrine board said they were planning to build a dam and generate electricity
6997986 so we joined the acalt committee to protest against the sasb which became a parallel government on the two routes resulting in losses to the tourism department
6997987 why was a board setup only for amarnath why not one to look after the other 200 hindu temples and shrines in the valley
6997988 we are shaivites shiva is our father we and the malik family are the rightful custodians of the shrine
6997989 when sasb ceo arun kumar was asked by the cabinet why kashmiri pandits were being kept out he had the guts to say he doesnt care for pandits
6997990 we have carried hindu pilgrims on our backs for 150 years
6997991 the agitation was largely secular and motivated by kashmiri concerns rather than muslim ones

6998001 i didnt study i live you cant study these things life teaches them to you you dont find them in a book ive read a lot of socrates on page 3 of the sun
6998002 football is like making love if you cant last 90 minutes like me you wont win
6998003 remote ip is over the limit for messages allowed to be sent in a single day
6998004 to me it is very intimidating to do it this way
6998005 it could easily be construed they are trying to get no answers at all it certainly doesnt make me very comfortable the truth is being ascertained
6998006 well ask them about the checks that were conducted and whether or not they asked for them approved of them things of that nature
6998007 to me it would be a lot less invasive and create a lot less anxiety if they received a written response first
6998008 this just raises more questions about the processes and procedures
6998009 since 1982 we have added 25 million plus jobs in this country we will have a larger pie
6998010 people will be fighting over the pie but thats a wonderful thing even if we grow at 1 percent per year we double the gdp per capita in 75 years the pie will grow enough that everyone will get more of the pie
6998011 i have enormous respect for warren but i have to disagree
6998012 i have already taken into consideration that the pie is going to grow

6998063 daddys leaving tomorrow to be in the army again doesnt give time for a psychological drama to develop concerning daddys deployment treating it like a simple fact of life something daddies and mommies sometimes do keeps the potential for anxiety at a minimum
6998064 i dont know even if you do know but would rather not discuss that particular issue with your child
6998065 i kept the television off and didnt discuss war with the kids around
6998066 consider having daddy say goodbye to the kids at home and then you and only you go with him to the airport
6998067 my best moment i have a lot of good moments but the one i prefer is when i kicked the hooligan
6998068 i didnt study i live you cant study these things life teaches them to you you dont find them in a book ive read a lot of socrates on page 3 of the sun

6998074 at some stage there was child trafficking involved prior to them coming into contact with the agency involved in india
6998075 its a decision in haste and we are totally disappointed with it
6998076 after extensive discussions and frank exchange of views the board resolved not to send our team at this time to pakistan to participate in the icc champions trophy cricket south africa president norman arendse said on friday
6998077 we respect the right of the pakistan cricket board to stage the tournament and we would urge the icc to reschedule the tournament as soon as possible
6998078 this was a difficult decision but it was the right one there is nothing more important than the safety of our national team said tony irish chief executive of the south african cricketers association
6998079 we are firmly behind pakistan niranjan shah secretary of indias board of control for cricket told broadcaster geo news
6998080 i think it all depends on pakistan and what they have to say on the security issue if pakistan says the country is safe to play in and the tournament can be held on schedule they have our support
6998081 very high risk of politically motivated violence because of conflict between the sri lankan government and tamil tigers
6998082 if you interview women in auckland and waikato somewhere between 17 and 25 will say they were sexually abused in childhood
6998083 that was more than 12 of the females and the ratio in boys was about a quarter of that
6998084 its about medical care and providing the best medical care for these patients but also about ensuring justice is done for either the victim or that not improper prosecution is undertaken
6998085 its not like you see on tv where its wrapped up in 45 minutes
6998086 our investigations can take months if not a period of years by the time we get through the court process
6998087 many women survive sexual abuse and go on and do very well but its an enormous burden thats borne by society
6998088 how can we not be happy weve gotten what we want
6998089 were overjoyed to see our own police on our streets again
6998090 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6998091 we havent seen that yet its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6998092 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
6998093 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
6998094 i remain deeply concerned that russian forces have not withdrawn to the pre augustposition as agreed
6998095 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
6998096 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6998097 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
6998098 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
6998099 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6998100 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6998101 this time last year i didnt think id get this far
6998102 i had a lot of trouble with injuries weve done a lot of work on my core stability and trying to even up the imbalance that happens when you have an artificial leg
6998103 she got cleaned out others had a different disability to her
6998104 athens was an amazing experience and i did break a world record in the 400 however that wasnt recognised with medals but medals are for life
6998105 china can support the chinese malaysia can support the malays germany can support the germans but people from other countries is playing for singapore
6998106 andy johnsons injury has improved immensely and hes quite close to full fitness clinically hes very close
6998107 im very concerned that the season has just begun and there are 38 matches to be played its important for me to have andy up running and fit for most of those matches
6998108 i dont want to throw him in early because its the tempting thing to do as often happens with these type of injuries the player gets back and theres a slight recurrence and he misses another couple of weeks
6998109 we know the success of our season is based on how quickly we can focus again on club targets after international games
6998110 fulham have a strong squad and their team look more dangerous going forward than they did last year
6998111 if you add to that it will be a derby you want a game where you have complete focus
6998112 youve seen it over the years even with the biggest teams that when players go away with their countries they struggle to perform on a saturday
6998113 weve got to make sure that doesnt happen to us
6998114 sometimes you can be selfish because they are your players but you have got to show some appreciation for them for the saturday and i think 45 minutes for a friendly is appropriate
6998115 it was a massive boost for us to beat fulham but thats firmly behind us now its all about looking forward
6998116 we went into saturdays game fully expecting to get something from fulham and blackburn is another opportunity to get something
6998117 we know what we are capable of and if we achieve that well be okay this season
6998118 obafemi martins on his own up front is a handful for anybody with his pace
6998119 his leap for the goal against manchester united at old trafford was nothing short of outstanding
6998120 the opposition have got to put big guys on him because if they put someone of a similar size he will beat them i have never seen anybody leap like him
6998121 they got a fantastic start last week by going to manchester united and getting a point when nobody including myself thought that might happen
6998122 theyll be buoyed by that but theyll also be buoyed by the fact there will be a full house there and its a fantastic place to play football anyway
6998123 there will be three players making their home debuts fabricio coloccini jonas guttierez and guthrie so it will be a huge test for us but thats what its all about going to these places and trying to get results
6998124 we talked about the players that we have how to progress and we both know it is important for the club that we work together
6998125 the talks were positive we cannot discuss names but we are now both working to improve our squad
6998126 there was no friction but some personal problems now things are more clear and that is positive it was a private conversation
6998127 ive got another two or three games to reassess the squad before the transfer window closes
6998128 i need to have a look and see if there are any areas which need strengthening but at the moment i am relatively happy with what we have got
6998129 we have a small squad but its a tight and together squad and i want all the players to have a chance of playing football this season
6998130 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6998131 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6998132 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6998133 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6998134 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6998135 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6998136 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6998137 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6998138 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6998139 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6998140 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6998141 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6998142 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6998143 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6998144 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6998145 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6998146 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6998147 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6998148 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6998149 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6998150 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6998151 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6998152 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6998153 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6998154 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6998155 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6998156 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6998157 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6998158 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6998159 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6998160 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6998161 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6998162 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6998163 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6998164 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6998165 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6998166 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6998167 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6998168 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6998169 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6998170 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6998171 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6998172 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6998173 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6998174 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6998175 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6998176 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6998177 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6998178 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6998179 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6998180 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6998181 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6998182 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6998183 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6998184 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6998185 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6998186 stalked her threatened her with bodily harm and made harassing phone calls in which he breathed heavily into the phone before hanging up
6998187 her fears are not only for herself but also the people around her
6998188 russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6998189 i do not believe that these actions can seriously contribute to the stabilisation of the situation in the region

6998206 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6998207 who among us is going to be able on day one to step in an end the war who among us understands what to do about pakistan who among us is going to pick up the phone and immediately interface with putin and tell him to lay off georgia because saakashvili is in real trouble who among us knows what theyre doing i have 35 years of experience
6998208 but 20 years of experience that has not been very solid in terms of projecting what was going to happen just doesnt make you a better commander in chief

6998233 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6998234 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6998235 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6998236 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6998237 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6998238 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6998239 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6998240 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6998241 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6998242 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6998243 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6998244 masalah urusan saya pribadi itu menjadi urusan pribadi sendri juga
6998245 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6998246 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6998247 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6998248 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6998249 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6998250 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

6998258 beinahe eine million sterreicherinnen und sterreicher haben gestern abend einen klaren punktesieg des bz spitzenkandidaten lh j rg haider bei der spitzenkandidatendiskussion im orf miterlebt unabh ngige experten journalisten und umfragen sehen j rg haider als klaren sieger das original hat gegen ber der blassen kopie mit kompetenz erfahrung seiner leistungsbilanz und seinen l sungsans tzen klar punkten k nnen
6998259 gestern hat j rg haider den wechsel der bundesgesch ftsf hrerin der fp zum bz verk ndet weitere pers nlichkeiten werden folgen
6998260 jeder mensch in sterreich hat ein recht auf bestm gliche gesundheitliche betreuung die h he des einkommens der verm genstand oder der soziale status eines menschen d rfen dabei keine rolle spielen
6998261 das hei t dass die vp das solidarische system gar nicht sichern sondern in richtung privatisierung gehen will
6998262 die im zuge der letztendlich gescheiterten gesundheitsreform diskutierten vorschl ge von der arztrechnung ber erbrachte leistungen bis zur so genannten aut idem regelung l sst vor allem eines bef rchten wer das bessere und nicht das billigste medikament haben will muss extra dazu zahlen das vertrauensverh ltnis arzt patient w re gest rt und kranke menschen stark verunsichert
6998263 uns ist jede und jeder kranke gleich viel wert unabh ngig vom einkommen
6998264 increasingly the potential for innovative thought and new medical therapies is jeopardized by threats aimed at researchers and their families
6998265 we need to send a message that violence or serious threats of violence are never the answer
6998266 i think that i am responsible for some conduct that has caused damage to the system to my office
6998267 i hope ive conveyed to the court that i feel badly
6998268 if there is a silver lining it is that ive become a better lawyer
6998269 i think a lot of stuff caught up with him
6998270 i completed my two year contract and i feel like i accomplished what i set out to do
6998271 we value and appreciate the vision bob has put in place for montalvo
6998272 he has helped us broaden our artistic programs by integrating contemporary art throughout the organization
6998273 we know that he had extended contact with the girl whos now 16
6998274 our concern is there may be additional victims because he clearly has no qualms about contacting girls who are significantly underage
6998275 we are very confident that hes the individual that savagely sexually assaulted this woman over the weekend
6998276 this would not have been solved if it werent for the poise of the victim the perseverance of the community providing us with tips and the investigative work of the investigative team
6998277 i drive the speed limit and when my 5 000 pound suv comes up on people hindering the flow of traffic i blow them off the road
6998278 i was extremely skeptical how are you going to get people to slow down well you did i did i now drive between 60 and 65 mph and fill up every six to seven days
6998279 would likely murder men simply because they appeared to be latino or african american
6998280 when a city is violating federal law and that violation of law leads to horrific consequences like this then the city has clearly acted in a negligent manner
6998281 she expects everything to be done for her why run when you can walk
6998282 so many factors had to come together for her to win
6998283 what he wanted was when you looked at a painting of his you always saw something else as well
6998284 shes called us mom and dad since she was eight years old
6998285 as a party responsible for these kids we do not find ourselves in position to let them go here anymore
6998286 she elevated the quality of life of these dogs above the safety of their neighbors
6998287 we wanted to create a unique experience that touched peoples emotions
6998288 if you can get people interested early on you may turn some on to a path of learning about biology or conservation
6998289 you cant have your own pipes crossing the delta with water that used to flow through the delta and claim it has no effect
6998290 the california department of fish and game and the state water resources control board charged with implementing laws in these areas were under resourced and frequently marginalized in water policy making
6998291 it will be not just a blueprint it will be a plan of action that can be adopted immediately which is a good thing
6998292 whether the kid is disabled or unruly or just being a hormonal teenager the state is saying hey we have a really easy option for you
6998293 if we save one child from being abused its well well worth it
6998294 the main interest i have is that it gives the mother or a parent another option of what to do with a child before they do something drastic
6998295 augusti l puks v i hiljemalt septembri alguseks peaks selge olema kas sadama arendamiseks antakse meile eas ist k mme miljonit krooni v i mitte

6998297 she sets an example the rest of us try to live up to
6998298 immigration judges should have the tools necessary to control their courtrooms and protect the adjudicatory system from fraud and abuse
6998299 this proposed rule seeks to preserve the fairness and integrity of immigration proceedings and increase the level of protection afforded to aliens in those proceedings
6998300 no matter where you stand on this issue its impossible to look at what has happened over the last three or four days and say this is a settled question
6998301 its also impossible to say the public isnt ready to participate in the debate the presidents are calling for
6998302 obviously one of the issues about any self diagnosis is what happens with the results
6998303 we want people to take more responsibility for their own health
6998304 he may have committed an illegal action but morally he was right and it meant a lot for him to say that to the army
6998305 i shot back out at them first from down there and then from up there
6998306 its an offer we feel would satisfy the ends of justice
6998307 and if it can settle the case then we would be happy with it if not then we go to trial
6998308 this so called offer was made by someone who has no authority to request such a thing and was done purely to score points in front of the cameras
6998309 we suggest the attorney general resign from running for governor with this weak and frivolous case
6998310 its a limited time offer and theyve got now until sept 3 to say yes to the deal
6998311 were the attorney for the people its a good deal for the people its a good deal for the city we think ultimately its a good deal for all the parties involved
6998312 i hope you are not back again in this situation
6998313 i am concerned that before too long hes going to be out on the street again
6998314 hopefully he uses his intelligence and charm to go into a different direction
6998315 cindy is a private person and i think in many ways that defines her
6998316 its like any bank you put money in then take it out when you need it
6998317 projects like semitropic are part of an absolute explosion in new water storage that weve seen in the last 15 years
6998318 we have all this water in wet years that we cant use
6998319 the important thing for us is how can we level it out and have a water supply that will be available for us in dry years we had to find some place to put it so we could use it later
6998320 its a good value and i feel really good about where we are
6998321 in places like kern county where they have been doing this for years they have worked out agreements with their neighbors as to how fast theyll draw water out
6998322 they are pretty sophisticated but in other areas these concerns still have to be solved
6998323 inimlikust aspektist ma sellele projektile k ll takistusi ei n e
6998324 this issue is as important or more important to the latino community than the presidential race
6998325 its a real core value for latinos theres no question about that
6998326 for those who vote which is a subset of the latino community youre likely to find support for the proposition opposing gay marriage but those sorts of moral issues do not motivate latinos to participate
6998327 i just dont know if the number of latino voters will be enough to put it the gay marriage ban over the top
6998328 the extent to which the republican party cares about their issues beyond just abortion and gay marriage
6998329 its the same core message that traditional marriage is the cornerstone of our society
6998330 the california supreme court chose to look at it strictly as a legal contract between party a and party b that is not just myopic its potentially devastating to families and society
6998331 i think its because everyone is so culturally catholic who is latino
6998332 i think thats one thing that kind of permeates every latino society
6998333 i think its the way we were raised its so catholic and there are set rules the way things are supposed to be
6998334 but i wouldnt say i agree with it just because of how i was raised
6998335 zeg mijne computer die werkt nimeer kunde gij misschien ff zeggen wa ik moet doen

6998338 the timing of course is simply the timing of when the agreement was completed
6998339 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
6998340 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
6998341 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats
6998342 he tracked me down in britain told me he was a huge fan and said he wanted me to be part of his creative life and now were doing night at the museum 2 together

6998354 the phone will ring and itll be him and ill maybe not answer
6998355 50 and his attorneys met yesterday with suffolk county authorities regarding the fire that destroyed 50s house
6998356 the meeting had been arranged weeks ago 50 is eager to review the findings of the investigation when it is concluded
6998357 its not my fault that she only has 20 000 to her name
6998358 she called me all sorts of horrible names and stormed off i now feel compelled to share with the world the background story as i will not allow my name to be slandered
6998359 def jam doesnt fund rihanna properly so marc uses the money rihanna makes from third party endorsements and from tours to fund her album and music videos
6998360 im feeling good and doing everything that i need to do to stay healthy i dont have to return to california until next month for my next round of treatments right now im taking the medication as i am scheduled to take it
6998361 we wife lisa niemi and i have been walking our dogs and enjoying some of the restaurants also we stay in the hotel so i can rest for filming
6998362 i thought wilder would be a very technical boxer but i was wrong
6998363 im not going to point any blame the key was to have fun
6998364 you have to look at how you approach american boxing now
6998365 do you approach it to continue to be a breeding ground a farm system for the pros because thats what it is
6998366 every one of these kids theyre gonna go home and go pro they know that coming in and thats fine but is that where your concentration is or is it to put a representative olympic team together because if thats what you want you have to go in a different direction
6998367 we just go on training the way we train and let it fall the way it falls
6998368 again if your aspiration is just to move to the pros ok but if you want to put together a representative u s boxing team youve got to do something about it
6998369 maybe you bring in other coaches from other countries guys who understand the system better or maybe you look better in your country for the right coaches
6998370 i asked him to move laterally all the time and try to avoid physical contact because the russian is very strong fortunately we followed our game plan perfectly
6998371 i took revenge today for francesco damianis defeat in the gold medal bout against tyrell biggs
6998372 and for angelo musones loss at the same olympics against another usa boxer henry tillman
6998373 what the photographs herein reveal is that china is not just one place one people but 33 distinct regions populated by 56 different ethnicities each with their own languages customs and lifestyles
6998374 it is my most sincere hope that this book unites the people immortalized in its pages tibetan pilgrims and beijing scholars uyghur muslims and shanghai bankers hong kong millionaires and shanxi miners in celebration of their glorious cultures
6998375 tom carter is an extraordinary photographer whose powerful work captures the heart and soul of the chinese people
6998376 we talked about the players that we have how to progress and we both know it is important for the club that we work together
6998377 the talks were positive we cannot discuss names but we are now both working to improve our squad
6998378 there was no friction but some personal problems now things are more clear and that is positive it was a private conversation
6998379 ive got another two or three games to reassess the squad before the transfer window closes
6998380 i need to have a look and see if there are any areas which need strengthening but at the moment i am relatively happy with what we have got
6998381 we have a small squad but its a tight and together squad and i want all the players to have a chance of playing football this season
6998382 obafemi martins on his own up front is a handful for anybody with his pace
6998383 his leap for the goal against manchester united at old trafford was nothing short of outstanding
6998384 the opposition have got to put big guys on him because if they put someone of a similar size he will beat them i have never seen anybody leap like him
6998385 they got a fantastic start last week by going to manchester united and getting a point when nobody including myself thought that might happen
6998386 theyll be buoyed by that but theyll also be buoyed by the fact there will be a full house there and its a fantastic place to play football anyway
6998387 there will be three players making their home debuts fabricio coloccini jonas guttierez and guthrie so it will be a huge test for us but thats what its all about going to these places and trying to get results
6998388 andy johnsons injury has improved immensely and hes quite close to full fitness clinically hes very close
6998389 im very concerned that the season has just begun and there are 38 matches to be played its important for me to have andy up running and fit for most of those matches
6998390 i dont want to throw him in early because its the tempting thing to do as often happens with these type of injuries the player gets back and theres a slight recurrence and he misses another couple of weeks
6998391 we know the success of our season is based on how quickly we can focus again on club targets after international games
6998392 fulham have a strong squad and their team look more dangerous going forward than they did last year
6998393 if you add to that it will be a derby you want a game where you have complete focus
6998394 liam lawrence is ahead of ricardo fuller in terms of fitness levels and ricardo is a player you wouldnt want to risk
6998395 he will say he is fit and raring to go but weve got a long season ahead of us and i have to weigh everything up
6998396 home games this season will be fantastic occasions and the atmosphere will be unique people who havent been here will be taken aback and its a big factor in our favour
6998397 martin laursen is the captain here i didnt say it officially to him but he is the captain of the side at the moment and i wouldnt see that changing
6998398 he leads by example im not saying he is running around shouting all over the place but then neither did gareth barry
6998399 he came back into the side for the final stretch of the season before last when we had a long unbeaten finish and since then has not looked back he has been excellent for us
6998400 youve seen it over the years even with the biggest teams that when players go away with their countries they struggle to perform on a saturday
6998401 weve got to make sure that doesnt happen to us
6998402 sometimes you can be selfish because they are your players but you have got to show some appreciation for them for the saturday and i think 45 minutes for a friendly is appropriate
6998403 it was a massive boost for us to beat fulham but thats firmly behind us now its all about looking forward
6998404 we went into saturdays game fully expecting to get something from fulham and blackburn is another opportunity to get something
6998405 we know what we are capable of and if we achieve that well be okay this season
6998406 se escucharon varias detonaciones como si se tratara de triquitraques
6998407 i tell people we are camping on a beautiful property with a really nice tent
6998408 we camped on it we saw it change every day the smells the sounds the life the feeling it was very exciting then we bought it
6998409 the way it functions has everything to do with whats outside
6998410 una madre de familia lleg al colegio saltzburgo y le dijo a la directora que mi ni a tenia vih desde esa fecha hasta ahora la profesora le da maltrato la sienta en la ltima silla del aula y le dice que ese es el lugar que debe ocupar diariamente esa situaci n es una realidad porque yo la he visto en dos ocasiones
6998411 es por esa raz n que desde mayo del presente a o decid sacar a mi ni a de la escuela ahora recibe clases particulares en casa de una vecina
6998412 por la falta de conocimiento es que pasan estas cosas cierta parte de la poblaci n no est informada de lo que es el vih es por eso que se dan estas situaciones en los colegios es lamentable que los padres de familia tengan que sacar a sus hijos de la escuela porque los mismos profesores los a slan o les dan maltrato porque conocieron que la menor padece de vih
6998413 estoy en contra de la venida del ciudadano presidente de la rep blica de nicaragua daniel ortega a nuestro pa s
6998414 si mi posici n afecta las decisiones del ciudadano presidente zelaya he presentado mi renuncia para que sea l quien tome la mejor decisi n
6998415 mi posici n en este momento y enmarcada en los derechos de las mujeres que durante toda mi vida he venido defendiendo es apoyar toda iniciativa a reafirmar los derechos humanos de toda mujer en el marco de la construcci n de una sociedad m s justa e igualitaria
6998416 me he caracterizado por asumir posiciones claras precisas y determinantes por eso es que he tomado esa decisi n
6998417 los presidentes de nicaragua y de venezuela participar n con sendos discursos en la hist rica ceremonia de firma de adhesi n de honduras al alba
6998418 considero que coincide con la acci n que hemos venido articulando rechazo al abuso contra la mujer me parece que es un acto de valent a y de coherencia con la lucha que representan las instituciones de la mujer a nivel regional
6998419 en este a o y medio del gobierno de ortega han pasado tres ministras por dicha instituci n
6998420 ortega cosecha lo que siembra y el maltrato a la comunidad internacional a pa ses amigos ha creado un rechazo que no es solamente por el caso de zoilam rica sino por el estilo de gobernar del presidente

6998422 barack has chosen joe biden to be his running mate

6998424 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
6998425 complimentary this is an incredible guy cmon hes a phenomenon
6998426 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
6998427 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6998428 the hearts of the people of omaha were for him
6998429 i think a lot of people felt like he was part of their family he was joyful and he had a good memory he really enjoyed being around people
6998430 why did world trade center building seven collapse nearly seven hours after the twin towers fell
6998431 was it diesel fuel in the building or planted explosives a controlled demolition of government offices as conspiracy theorists allege in films like loose change
6998432 this is the first time that were aware of that a building over 15 stories tall has collapsed primarilly due to fire
6998433 tons of molten metal was found 21 days after the attack
6998434 steel doesnt begin to melt until 2 700 degrees which is much hotter than what these fires could have caused
6998435 dr steven jones found it in the dust that landed in the entire area of lower manhattan and he finds it in the chunks of previously molten metal from the towers
6998436 investigators said they did consider certain so called conspiracy theories reported cnn
6998437 alternative theories are really none of them have been found to be credible

6998446 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6998447 starts to shake and cough just like the old man in that famous book by nabokov
6998448 precocious temptress a cunning underage vixen wholl stop at nothing to get her man
6998449 when the los angeles public library was exposed for circulating a copy the only result was a boom in the sales of the book in california the texas town of lolita gravely debated whether it should change its name to jackson presumably in case it was mistaken for a little girl
6998450 but the feared american obscenity trial never took place at least not in a courtroom instead the book became the butt of endless jokes and cartoons again america was absorbing something controversial into its popular culture instead of subjecting it to a witch hunt
6998451 mainstream comedians all had a lolita gag the unspoken basis of the joke being that
6998452 all this playfulness marked the beginning of lolita hazes disparagement the advance guard of what would prove to be a legion of faux lolitas soon to emerge
6998453 nabokov was quite shocked if only he had known what lay in store for his nymphet
6998454 singers say this is the best opera house in which to sing in america
6998455 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6998456 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6998457 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6998458 its a dream come true to be on the cover of a video game
6998459 ive got a wii at home i like the bowling the golf the simple games but i havent gotten into any of the sports games ive tried this about three times now and its pretty cool i think kids are going to love it it gets into the game a lot more than some of the other systems
6998460 i tell you in a post 9 11 world getting a gun like that on a plane is a pain in the ass
6998461 we like to say its more epic and more intimate its on a larger scale with the multi player mode and you have more of a sense of the war thats going on around you but the story is more intimate
6998462 has been looking for his wife for quite some time its those little touches that really make it when you have a great sci fi world so yeah we have the monsters we love the blood we love all that but if you can bring it back and make it a little more personal then hopefully we have a winner
6998463 were still locking down the songs list but there are about 30 songs and youll be able to download content through xbox live as well you can attach your mp3 player and play your own drm free music on it so the song selection will be limitless
6998464 the music started as therapy and its still therapy now
6998465 when i play and sing its because i need to not because i want to its been an interesting journey thats taken me somewhere im happy to be but couldnt have ever expected
6998466 like a lot of people my age i grew up listening to what was popular
6998467 but after the accident i couldnt listen to the music i had before i sought out other quieter things my friends gave me records and one of the first was stan getzs
6998468 i was learning as i was going and so that type of music became more and more personal for me
6998469 we keep the heart of the music from worrisome heart but i like to push the boundaries of what you can do live as much as possible without removing the intention and integrity of the music
6998470 im always writing the music the lyrics and melody all come at the same time arising out of spontaneous moments
6998471 if he likes it he sits next to me on the piano and if he doesnt he stays on the other side of the room
6998472 i watched the guys warm up and its hot out there
6998473 i just sat there with my cooling vest on listening to music and just chilled out i think that really paid off
6998474 the majority are using it to block out everything else thats going on around them
6998475 essentially what theyre doing is really not thinking at all theyre just listening to music and being in a space before they actually get ready to narrow their focus
6998476 kevin drew and broken social scene brendan canning those guys jason collett all the guys from broken social scene thats my favourite band probably
6998477 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6998478 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6998479 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6998480 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6998481 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6998482 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6998483 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6998484 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6998485 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6998486 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6998487 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6998488 for the first two years i was never invited into the home of anyone who grew up here
6998489 even after i started to make friends it took a while to be invited into anyones home
6998490 im not criticizing but there is an obsession with privacy in this culture im a part of it now too when i go back to lebanon im horrified by what little privacy there is over there
6998491 the book de niros game has been successful im not going to deny it
6998492 i won a very prestigious award i won a gold medal for canada in literature
6998493 i understand the public dimension is necessary and a part of it is really enjoyable but its intrusive and its getting really overwhelming i have to protect myself after the canadian tour im going to give myself a few months to disappear
6998494 i have friends here and at a certain age you get tired of wandering if i went back to lebanon or moved to some other place id have to go through another immigration
6998495 i like to portray marginal characters i like to explore and create that world the iranians in montreal are a very small community and they are anglophones for the most part which makes them even more marginalized
6998496 by forcing himself into peoples houses he is forcing himself into their lives
6998497 i chose the cockroach because its close to the earth
6998498 the cockroach is a survivor not very welcome resilient and a creature that penetrates peoples homes very easily
6998499 they have this great sense of humour but theres also a lot of darkness ive always been really attracted to that
6998500 also growing up in lebanon we had to memorize a poem every week and stand in front of the class and recite it the delivery was as important as the memorization that gave me an appreciation for the music in my ear
6998501 i like editors who are forgiving who actually see something in the imperfections my writing is all about the imperfections its so convoluted and its so bastardized by other languages
6998502 im always surprised at how much stuff i have and how easy it is at least so far
6998503 there is no nation of you there is no nation of me our only nation lives in lucid dreams
6998504 i havent talked to the media for a long time so what people know about me is based on gossip and false information
6998505 being famous allows me to do what i love to inspire people and be a role model to young women and if i have to deal with that kind of scrutiny its cool but there are times when i could do without it
6998506 once they love you its for life their perception of me is what theyve read in the tabloids or seen on access hollywood when they hear my new album theyll understand
6998507 ill be with loretta lynn roy clark and patty loveless i was so excited i started jumping up and down everyones coming all my family and friends
6998508 ive never talked in public about my private life but i started putting it into songs around the time i recorded my third album
6998509 the record company said they sounded like country songs and dismissed them what did i know i started in this business when i was 17 i didnt know how to write how to make a record i was just happy to have a deal
6998510 im not saying im not proud of some of the pop music i made but with so many producers it was impossible to find my own voice in country music i can do that because the songs are all stories now i can tell my own story now im a songwriter
6998511 i came up with some of the titles and some of the melodies and every day for three months i brought my journal to the writing sessions so i feel these songs are part of me maybe ill learn guitar then i wouldnt need anybody
6998512 dolly wrote me a sweet letter and told me to hang in and that shed be there for me when i started recording this album she listened to some of it and said she had 12 songs ready to go but she wanted to write something special she came up with do you know it was an amazing gift
6998513 i get to wear shorts and tank tops its not much of an image change
6998514 and i dont have to worry about wardrobe changes and choreography im not doing that again no way no sir
6998515 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6998516 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6998517 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6998518 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6998519 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6998520 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6998521 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6998522 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6998523 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6998524 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6998525 this is a planning took where all things are going
6998526 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6998527 g venlik ilkeleri er evesinde olu turulan g venlik ku a ndaki zel ara larla donat lm kontrol noktalar nda sadece bar g c askerleri kalacak

6998529 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6998530 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6998531 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6998532 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6998533 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6998534 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6998535 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6998536 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6998537 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6998538 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6998539 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6998540 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6998541 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6998542 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6998543 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6998544 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6998545 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6998546 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6998547 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6998548 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6998549 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6998550 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6998551 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6998552 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6998553 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6998554 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6998555 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6998556 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6998557 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6998558 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6998559 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6998560 its incredible amazing wonderful its a brilliant piece of theatre and the finest role ive ever played
6998561 and he was the first guy to use the shrink wrap you see everywhere nowadays way to go dad
6998562 kind of the perfect family no significant troubles or hardships i had a good growing up just like any normal kid
6998563 there was never this light bulb over my head telling me i should be in the business it just sort of fell into place
6998564 i would be at this school concert and then somebody would come up and ask my parents if i could sing somewhere i didnt really understand that other people didnt do this all the time
6998565 well just put this in the bank for your education
6998566 the first thing we did was record my singing in a studio and that remains such a positive sense memory for me i loved it
6998567 debbie allen was staging all of us madonna was also performing she had a tough rehearsal and wasnt very happy
6998568 what else do i remember people telling me to wear my security badge seeing bob hope and geena davis kind of a of all the generations in hollywood back when it was still glamorous
6998569 there isnt a glamour side any more just a paparazzi side that can eat you alive
6998570 if you ever find the glamour from the old days again then sign me up but otherwise well i like leaving the stage door at night and just becoming joe again
6998571 my extended family was all from massachusetts and i knew id have a safety net if i needed it
6998572 where during a three hour dinner cruise the waiters would spontaneously combust into song
6998573 i thought i would get off the plane in l a and land in a movie but that wasnt the case
6998574 dedicated to the revitalization and deconstruction of theatre as we know it
6998575 i cant say enough about working with them i know that my time with them isnt over
6998576 pops in for a couple of hours and imparts a little wisdom to us
6998577 he always says that the most important thing is the lyric tell the story and mean it even if it just seems like youre singing about a girl named sherry at a party
6998578 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6998579 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6998580 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6998581 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6998582 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6998583 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6998584 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6998585 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6998586 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6998587 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6998588 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6998589 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6998590 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6998591 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6998592 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6998593 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6998594 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6998595 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6998596 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6998597 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6998598 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6998599 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6998600 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6998601 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6998602 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6998603 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6998604 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6998605 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6998606 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6998607 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6998608 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6998609 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6998610 in an effort to clean up emissions of all motorised vehicles the eu government has set a number of standards to be met within certain deadlines
6998611 the vespa px will undoubtedly go down in history as one of the best a model does not last for 30 years unless it was right in the first place
6998612 my generation has grown up with the px it was designed and created in 1977 when i was eight so ive known nothing else
6998613 it mobilised the masses again in the 80s you had the jam quadrophenia and the mod revival and the px was sitting there in the showroom
6998614 there were thousands of scooters on the roads again you could buy it on hire purchase it was style you could afford thirty years on people were still buying it
6998615 you could say it was the vw beetle of the two wheeled world
6998616 its a shame really because its the end of a long line of motor scooters its the end of the true blood line
6998617 there are new vespas out there the company created the scooter 60 years ago and is still making a version of it
6998618 so you can still go out and buy a stylish scooter but what you cant buy is the last piece of the history
6998619 its like the new fiat 500 the style is there but its just not quite the same which is a shame as the vespa px is a design classic
6998620 the modern scooter rider requires ease of use as one of its main priorities for scootering around and a twist and go machine provides that easy driving style
6998621 the px had a manual gearbox that was born out of its traditional heritage as opposed to what todays customer demands

6998631 as a party responsible for these kids we do not find ourselves in position to let them go here anymore
6998632 this issue is as important or more important to the latino community than the presidential race
6998633 its a real core value for latinos theres no question about that
6998634 for those who vote which is a subset of the latino community youre likely to find support for the proposition opposing gay marriage but those sorts of moral issues do not motivate latinos to participate
6998635 i just dont know if the number of latino voters will be enough to put it the gay marriage ban over the top
6998636 the extent to which the republican party cares about their issues beyond just abortion and gay marriage
6998637 its the same core message that traditional marriage is the cornerstone of our society
6998638 the california supreme court chose to look at it strictly as a legal contract between party a and party b that is not just myopic its potentially devastating to families and society
6998639 i think its because everyone is so culturally catholic who is latino
6998640 i think thats one thing that kind of permeates every latino society
6998641 i think its the way we were raised its so catholic and there are set rules the way things are supposed to be
6998642 but i wouldnt say i agree with it just because of how i was raised

6998651 in places like kern county where they have been doing this for years they have worked out agreements with their neighbors as to how fast theyll draw water out
6998652 they are pretty sophisticated but in other areas these concerns still have to be solved
6998653 you cant have your own pipes crossing the delta with water that used to flow through the delta and claim it has no effect
6998654 the california department of fish and game and the state water resources control board charged with implementing laws in these areas were under resourced and frequently marginalized in water policy making

6998665 committing the unpardonable offence of outfitting everyone in green crocs
6998666 so sub standard in fact that the labels and embroidery on the athletics vests says
6998667 no one from sascoc is able to comment about the shoddy gear but it is clear the poorly made clothing and lacklustre fitting is going to have a major effect on the teams performance
6998668 while the worlds elite athletes will be dressed in the best and latest running gear available the south african team will be dressed like primary school cross country runners with parents on a budget
6998669 the girls look like frumps in those hideous shapeless to the floor skirts that look more like sacks than clothing

6998718 i thought sheffield owned just the property i didnt know they owned the building
6998719 were looking into the situation and trying to determine the facts right now

6998750 i think its time for me to go a little bit further
6998751 i have the potential to do that but you try not to look so far ahead go one match at a time just see what happens because once you get into the second week of the tournament anything can happen
6998752 you have to go into for me anyway every tournament to win i always feel if you set a goal to reach the third round if you do make it to the third round you almost are satisfied with what you achieved
6998753 the one thing that unites all human beings regardless of age gender religion economic status or ethnic background is that deep down inside we all believe that we are above average drivers
6998754 so many of these listings or upgrades show different faces of the history of the slave trade from an elaborate headstone erected by an earl for a beloved servant once a slave in virginia to an upgrade for a house occupied by a former slave turned prosperous coal merchant
6998755 we are starting to claw our way back and do some positive things its great to see all the lads smiling and feel the joy around them weve been through some frustrating times but were getting there were making progress every week but we still have a lot more to do yet
6998756 there were flat periods and a couple of times in the first half when we were all at sea near our own line there are still things to improve on
6998757 we wanted to come and play well here at wigan
6998758 we were disappointed with our performance the last time here it is the first time leeds have scored over 50 points against wigan at wigan and that is something for us all to feel proud of
6998759 leeds were pretty hot we couldnt handle them which was disappointing
6998760 at 12 10 we had got back in the game but we gifted them a try and then let in a couple of soft ones but were not down and out it was a great lesson for us on how intense we have to be at this time of the year

6998765 he cannot be fucking the right girls if he thinks thats all it takes to be a crazy bitch
6998766 quite honestly i dont know what goes on other sets part of it comes from the fact that we come from and are still involved in relatively low budget film making a certain amount of organisation is key to be being able to operate in that world it is also possible that it is just a temperamental thing other people may function better in a chaotic environment than we do
6998767 its nice that it changes we enjoy all of it
6998768 money isnt important to them except to make movies they never want to be in a position where anyone has any power to tell them what to do
6998769 its a story that writes itself thats what journalism is
6998770 it got thrown into the transit by producer scott rudin we liked it and we made it
6998771 there was no more conscious decision to place it into the body of everything else we were doing than that

6998787 we shall repair the cross again and again no matter how often it is desecrated
6998788 what is more scandalous is that it is not the first time that the government has been shown to be completely incapable of protecting the integrity of highly sensitive data rendering them unfit to be charged with protecting our safety
6998789 failed to live up to their obligations under the cease fire agreement
6998790 their feeling now is you made gains and you should keep them

6998792 one of the russian war goals was to bring down this government and by economic pressure they hope to do that

6998811 delibes ha comentado que resulta imposible conocer el n mero exacto de las especies que existen y de las que se extinguen pero que su conservaci n debe ser una preocupaci n general
6998812 el respeto a la naturaleza es un inter s sanamente ego sta porque si las especies desaparecen es que algo malo est pasando y evitarlo es tarea de todos
6998813 aunque la situaci n de este animal es cr tica hay motivos para el optimismo
6998814 la pantera nebulosa de borneo es el mayor depredador de la isla y si el mayor depredador sobrevive en una antigua zona de tala eso significa que el resto de las especies se est recuperando
6998815 hemos decidido que es lo mejor para el animal ha sido una decisi n dif cil
6998816 this one sounds right but this one has a little bit of truth in it it could be either one

6998820 muchas de las acciones que podemos acometer ahora s lo pueden tener buenos resultados hablamos por ejemplo de mejorar la gesti n de los r os y restaurar la capacidad de almacenamiento y de amortiguaci n de las inundaciones de las llanuras fluviales y los humedales
6998821 todas estas acciones continu tienen una rentabilidad econ mica social y ambiental a corto plazo si adem s todo ello sirve para aumentar la resistencia de los r os al cambio clim tico tendremos entonces un beneficio a adido
6998822 agua para la vida lecciones para la adaptaci n al cambio clim tico mejorando la gesti n de los r os para las personas y la naturaleza

6998824 esta es una de las plagas m s agresivas que han llegado introducidas a gal pagos y que afectan directamente a los habitantes

6998829 we had warned the government to target police and the army if it didnt stop operations against us in swat
6998830 he did not train the day after the england game but he was back in training on friday
6998831 he has had a problem before with his groin and he has picked up another one on the other leg
6998832 that is the reason he was not playing from the start against standard liege
6998833 it was clear that he could not be fully fit after that he would be superman no
6998834 but we know that he will be better and better at the moment our idea is to protect the player
6998835 it has been an amazing journey for me this past week i have been training so hard because to come back after the synchro i really wanted to put in a good performance
6998836 im going into the final now to enjoy myself and get the whole experience of what an olympic final is going to be like because in london 2012 that is what i am aiming for
6998837 to go into the olympic final in london i just need that experience from beijing
6998838 it just didnt go my way i dived well yesterday and i knew it was going to be a bit more of a struggle this morning but i didnt think it was going to be like that
6998839 were looking to go forward and i think that can happen
6998840 top ten would be lovely we have to those points on the board as soon as possible and start kicking on hopefully everyone will stay fit and we will be able to do that
6998841 i think the gaffers had time to calm down since the hull game and hes got his point across now to the boys
6998842 unfortunately it was an international week and a few of the boys were away but we will get the opportunity now to come together and work on what he needs
6998843 if we can get off out first six to ten games and get some points on the board and be in a comfortable position then i think that gives the platform to play more confident attractive football without the pressures so thats the aim
6998844 yeah it would be nice to get it on the pitch
6998845 im looking forward to it and i think we could work well
6998846 trapattoni has probably given them that freedom of not being afraid to play
6998847 when youre playing for your country you re nearly afraid to make mistakes because so many people back home are relying on you
6998848 you need to be brave enough to play with an abandonment of if i make a mistake i make a mistake and move on
6998849 in the first half there was great one touch passing it was nice to watch and thats the first time in ages ive been able to say an irish team is nice to watch
6998850 id like to see andy reid play because he can out the ball on a sixpence for robbie keane and kevin doyle
6998851 the three opening games will give us a good platform to build on he added
6998852 italy have their own problems we can get off to a good start and then build on that im sure thats what trapattoni is thinking about
6998853 get off to a flying start the belief starts building and anything after thats possible
6998854 trapattoni has probably given them that freedom of not being afraid to play
6998855 when youre playing for your country you re nearly afraid to make mistakes because so many people back home are relying on you
6998856 you need to be brave enough to play with an abandonment of if i make a mistake i make a mistake and move on
6998857 in the first half there was great one touch passing it was nice to watch and thats the first time in ages ive been able to say an irish team is nice to watch
6998858 id like to see andy reid play because he can out the ball on a sixpence for robbie keane and kevin doyle
6998859 the three opening games will give us a good platform to build on he added
6998860 italy have their own problems we can get off to a good start and then build on that im sure thats what trapattoni is thinking about
6998861 get off to a flying start the belief starts building and anything after thats possible
6998862 it has been an amazing journey for me this past week i have been training so hard because to come back after the synchro i really wanted to put in a good performance
6998863 im going into the final now to enjoy myself and get the whole experience of what an olympic final is going to be like because in london 2012 that is what i am aiming for
6998864 to go into the olympic final in london i just need that experience from beijing
6998865 it just didnt go my way i dived well yesterday and i knew it was going to be a bit more of a struggle this morning but i didnt think it was going to be like that
6998866 were looking to go forward and i think that can happen
6998867 top ten would be lovely we have to those points on the board as soon as possible and start kicking on hopefully everyone will stay fit and we will be able to do that
6998868 i think the gaffers had time to calm down since the hull game and hes got his point across now to the boys
6998869 unfortunately it was an international week and a few of the boys were away but we will get the opportunity now to come together and work on what he needs
6998870 if we can get off out first six to ten games and get some points on the board and be in a comfortable position then i think that gives the platform to play more confident attractive football without the pressures so thats the aim
6998871 yeah it would be nice to get it on the pitch
6998872 im looking forward to it and i think we could work well
6998873 he did not train the day after the england game but he was back in training on friday
6998874 he has had a problem before with his groin and he has picked up another one on the other leg
6998875 that is the reason he was not playing from the start against standard liege
6998876 it was clear that he could not be fully fit after that he would be superman no
6998877 but we know that he will be better and better at the moment our idea is to protect the player
6998878 vine por una medalla y me voy con las manos vac as
6998879 new c span sites get way unboring with youtube twitter qik flash
6998880 how did we ever live without cellphones here we are having this interview while im driving we dont have to make time later and arent gps systems wonderful you cant get lost anymore its impossible
6998881 and after being on it for the first time i can say that everything i heard is true in a word let me say it is a challenge
6998882 when i retired in 2003 when he was with team penske i really stopped driving
6998883 when this program the acura alms team came together earlier this year this is only the teams fifth race and i decided to drive i wasnt sure what to expect
6998884 i can safely say though that it really feels like i was never out of the cockpit im not as polished as i was but im getting there it was nice to be able to run at mosport it was really helpful it was certainly better than not testing
6998885 it is my aim it is my hope in due course
6998886 it must be said that penske has one of the best racing teams in the world full stop
6998887 in my career i have seen race teams at all levels across the globe and his is one of the best if not
6998888 but it should be noted that this team is not an exercise to make
6998889 so i cant forget what i learned when i had the good fortune to drive for penske to see how he operated to see how he did things it was part of my education but it was the same when i drove for jackie stewart in formula 3000 and jim hall his first season in cart
6998890 it is because of them that i am the person i am the knowledge i have today stems from all of them combined
6998891 dixon indy 500 winner and soon to be crowned 2008 indy car champion scott dixon was always tough to race against
6998892 and tony kanaan dario franchitti and helio castroneves of course its hard not to gain respect for those guys
6998893 you know the arena is important and the cars are important but the most important thing is to have regard and respect for your fellow competitors and to have them feel that way about you
6998894 i am so happy that scott will be joining us for that race
6998895 i tried hard to obtain his services because i consider him to be one of the best racing drivers in the world today he has been working hard at perfecting his craft and it is very hard to find any chinks in his armour
6998896 all i can say is that we will do everything we can to support acura in the alms
6998897 what you percieve to be average may differ from me
6998898 look at me im new but now im really safe too its like an electoral condom cool huh
6998899 i mean i dont know i have nowhere to go
6998900 i need some clothes and pocket money you know my friend took all my cash
6998901 ben and i spoke about it a few years ago briefly
6998902 i said if he ever made the team i want europe to win so id struggle to work for an american
6998903 we were joking around and just giving each other a lot grief but deep down we both knew what was going to happen so it made it easier
6998904 he said he would do it if i really wanted him to but it just worked out better if i just found an american
6998905 mostly just because of the stress and the pressure that ive been dealing with over the past 24 hours
6998906 theres been a lot of doubt in my mind its the kind of thing ive never dealt with before its a little victory for me today
6998907 the amount of pressure that ive been dealing with over the past six months just the mounting pressure of being a potential double gold medallist and knowing that ive won a lot of races up until now but they dont really matter once you get here because its this one that counts it has put a lot of pressure on me
6998908 its the worst thing that could happen having to stop at the olympics
6998909 ive never stopped any race since i began even when i fell or broke something i always finish
6998910 here it was a physical problem i couldnt do anything else
6998911 i had a bit of trouble shifting on the last climb and irina was right on my wheel i had to put a foot down she got by me and that was bronze
6998912 but coming to your first olympics getting fourth that was awesome
6998913 when i got back on my bike my pulse and my breathing just went very high
6998914 even if i slowed down i was unable to feel better i stopped one time completely but it didnt work i stopped again and then i had to stop
6998915 the game has changed and the way the game is played has to be changed
6998916 durrr nintendo dont put first and third party software together
6998917 yeah but what about taking out guitar hero 3 what about taking out the casual games what about taking out the shovelware etc etc etc
6998918 we are selling third party games and they are doing very well and better than our competitors
6998919 no matter how you slice it the wii third party game story is not a pretty one
6998920 but malstrom they have to know smart people will easily cut through this statistical jelly with the clean knife of facts
6998921 i really wish the ds graphics were better man imagine how awesome that would be
6998922 trapattoni has probably given them that freedom of not being afraid to play
6998923 when youre playing for your country you re nearly afraid to make mistakes because so many people back home are relying on you
6998924 you need to be brave enough to play with an abandonment of if i make a mistake i make a mistake and move on

6998930 he did not train the day after the england game but he was back in training on friday
6998931 he has had a problem before with his groin and he has picked up another one on the other leg
6998932 that is the reason he was not playing from the start against standard liege
6998933 it was clear that he could not be fully fit after that he would be superman no

6998944 yeah it would be nice to get it on the pitch
6998945 im looking forward to it and i think we could work well
6998946 if you do not immunise a baby in this situation youre putting that babys life at risk
6998947 and about a third of those chronic carriers will die young from cancer of the liver or cirrhosis of the liver this is a horrible disease
6998948 when the opportunity presents itself im just trying to take the bull by the horns
6998949 hes not on the field its hard i mean its tough for him right now hes not on the field until we get him back on the field were not going to know
6998950 he wasnt quite there yet thats just being honest hes working at it but hes not quite there yet
6998951 just with the naked eye it looked like he played well
6998952 the other guys had been doing some stuff against kaczur and i just fed off what they had been doing
6998953 the only thing i can control is what i can control and go out and play my butt off
6998954 everybody hears it why dont we have a big stud but if you can get that out of your mind for one second i know its difficult for a lot of people but we think we have six really really good receivers
6998955 theyve all played well when theyve got a chance to play
6998956 hank a couple years ago made some big plays for us greg lewis has made big plays in the super bowl he scored a touchdown jason avant we think is going to be a super inside player and then you add desean to the mix and we think we have a very good group of receivers we think theres no question in our minds we can win the super bowl with these receivers
6998957 i think you have to give guys opportunities to make plays and we did that
6998958 its obviously big when you lose somebody like kevin and then you dont have your other top receiver in reggie brown i think the preseason gives guys an opportunity to come out and showcase their talents and do great things for us we have a ways to go but its a good sign

6998960 this hasnt been a case of alex and shaun not performing well
6998961 this has been a case of j t performing very well thats why we are where we are j t has very good command of the offense hes played well in all three preseason games and now its time for us to get ready for the regular season
6998962 a loose ligament and im waiting to get more info on what i need to do
6998963 i definitely thought about that he scored one before i did
6998964 it went through my mind i thought the next time i get out ive got to take it the distance because he did its a very competitive game
6998965 theyre young and have a lot of energy they love to play veteran players love watching them
6998966 i thought it was a good game in some spots and in others where we need to pick up and do some work
6998967 i was glad to see we tackled better and caught the ball better than last week
6998968 you have to have a mentality that every time you have a shot to return it
6998969 my blockers i just trusted them so i could get going i took advantage of my opportunity
6998970 i felt the punter got a good kick on it and kind of outkicked his coverage i just did a great job of catching the ball and making two moves to the side hitting the seam and getting right up the middle from there it was nothing but daylight
6998971 we are progressing week in and week out i think you have to give guys opportunities to make plays and we did that
6998972 all in all i thought it was a good game in spots
6998973 i was glad to see we tackled better and caught the ball better than we did last week and then i thought our special teams played better it was good to see the young returners do some things i think theyre both explosive players
6998974 i just wanted to show to the fans everybody thats watching coaches everybody that im capable of getting the job done
6998975 im young im a rookie and things like that but i definitely feel i play very confident i just know what im capable of doing
6998976 you see three fat boys and a fast dude in front of you blocking
6998977 its the new england patriots theyre a very confident team and a great team also
6998978 dang he scored one before i did i knew the next time i got out there i was going to have to take it the distance because he took it the distance
6998979 i felt the punter kind of outkicked his coverage and i just did a great job of catching the ball and making two moves to the side and hitting the seam and getting right up the middle from there it was nothing but daylight
6998980 it wasnt the worst one weve seen it wasnt the simplest one weve seen
6998981 just to be back among the guys i really feel like im close to where i need to be for the opener and im definitely going to get there in two weeks
6998982 i was very pleased with the exception of a couple of plays
6998983 its important for the offensive line to come together and be able to work together with the different calls so the running backs can see the different styles
6998984 shawn is a little bit different than max jean gilles in the way he protects and the way he moves around a little bit
6998985 you kind of have to give people an opportunity to get adjusted to this league
6998986 its all good they will probably give me the boos give me the yeahs

6999030 its a challenge and its one that i enjoy i know some of the players enjoy it because there are a few who are probably getting a few boos when they dont really warrant it someones always a scapegoat and its always a player first and then its the manager and if not its the chairman the only way you change that is by winning

6999033 every striker would love to get off to a flying start simeon went through it last year it took him a while to score but all of a sudden goals just started flying in what they have got to do is keep getting in the right areas if they keep doing that the goals will come

6999202 its hard to get your bearings financially especially when you realize that what we all previously thought were solid brick and mortar institutions were in fact playing fast and loose with billions of dollars
6999203 well sit around the cafeteria and ask them what do you do
6999204 when im out socially people are a lot more likely to ask me questions about money the same way youd ask a doctor you happened to meet at a party about your cold
6999205 a woman stopped me in the supermarket the other day to ask me how long is this going to last
6999206 i think when people started being more honest about the fact that couldnt afford the long trips or the big vacation and said lets go downtown lets put our energy here there was a shift
6999207 so i was trying to decipher my 401 k statement the other day
6999208 ik koop alleen maar aandelen in bedrijven die zo simpel zijn dat ze door een idioot bestuurd kunnen worden
6999209 kommer en kwel de kern van de avond was de premi re van de documentairefilm
6999210 het is economisch riskant dat we zoveel schuld hebben en dat andere landen deze op zich nemen ik ken mijn geschiedenis anderen vergaren zo gigantische politieke macht en we zouden ze niet moeten vertrouwen
6999211 ik zie het nog niet als buitengewoon alarmerend maar de groei moet niet doorzetten op termijn zou dat politiek gezien tot instabiliteit kunnen leiden er zouden wat demagogen kunnen opkomen

6999216 i see it on the horizon but im not focusing on it
6999217 when she dated fellow band member tony kanal whose parents are indian

6999222 robinho has a contract with madrid but i think it would be harmful if he stayed at the club and wasnt happy about it because it would be bad for his career
6999223 he also has world cup qualification to play with his national team and i think this would be very bad for robinho
6999224 if i have to give my consent to bringing in a new player wholl just fill the gaps or is a favour to another club then i wont do it
6999225 the della valle family brought in managerial competence economic stability and a futuristic strategy
6999226 they invested rather than spent and did not make the mistake of assuming they knew everything about the sport calling instead on the advice of experienced collaborators

6999268 we have all this water in wet years that we cant use
6999269 the important thing for us is how can we level it out and have a water supply that will be available for us in dry years we had to find some place to put it so we could use it later
6999270 its a good value and i feel really good about where we are
6999271 in places like kern county where they have been doing this for years they have worked out agreements with their neighbors as to how fast theyll draw water out
6999272 they are pretty sophisticated but in other areas these concerns still have to be solved

6999293 but i have to be happy i came out to these olympics with the hope of getting two medals one of them gold and that is what i have done
6999294 it has been fantastic i feel very lucky to be here
6999295 physically the 1 000m final takes the edge off you but mentally as well that was the one i had the most pressure on me to win that was the one i really really wanted to win
6999296 it would have been great to have done the double today but coming into the race i was more jaded and these guys are world class athletes
6999297 if i had finished without a medal today i would have been pretty upset and i say that off the back of being olympic champion
6999298 i knew i had it in me to at least get another medal today
6999299 it went ok it wasnt my best race i came here wanting to go one better than athens and i came away with the same
6999300 i am sure later down the track i will realise what i have achieved but at the moemnt i am disappointed
6999301 i really was not expecting the older audience to be able to relate to it because i was like oh is crush too immature but i think the way the song talks about a crush its in a mature way that all ages are able to relate to
6999302 he couldnt really be thrown out since i needed a guardian
6999303 there wasnt one story that actually came out to the press that was true
6999304 we werent allowed to say anything while we were on the show no one on the show or their families was allowed to interact with the press at all and what we learned early on was that tabloids could basically say whatever because they knew we couldnt say anything
6999305 you really just have to look on the bright side
6999306 people are constantly asking you about press stuff i just tried to do my best every week

6999357 cia has made its own inquiries overseas and no one no individual and no intelligence service has substantiated suskinds account of habbush or the bogus letter
6999358 at this point the origins of the forgery like the whereabouts of habbush himself remain unclear but this much is certain suskind is off the mark
6999359 at least 70 innocent civilians most of them women and children
6999360 the evidence is overwhelming that there is a specialized system dedicated to processing faces and not other objects
6999361 why we are so good at recognizing and remembering faces
6999362 a brief glance at a face conveys a wealth of information about identity expression gender age mood intent attractiveness social states and even honesty
6999363 the ability to extract this information within a fraction of a second of viewing a face is important for normal social interaction and has probably played a critical role in the survival of our primate ancestors
6999364 just by looking at an fmri we can tell if a subject is looking at faces or places

6999371 its a very unique storm in that it has been sitting here for so long
6999372 storms go stationary and have erratic motion all the time

6999378 he was generous over the years when i was growing up so it doesnt compute that he would do that that he would leave all of us out
6999379 we were well ahead of schedule most of the morning the rocket lifted off pitched over as it was supposed to but continued to veer south
6999380 i would be surprised if we dont know what happened fairly quickly
6999381 with shootings you need to get there quick enough to get the shot of them loading him into the ambulance
6999382 unless hes dead on arrival if hes d o a youve got all the time in the world
6999383 to actually be in the middle of it all the gangs and all its just a visual feast
6999384 i swear on my life i was put on this planet to film police chases
6999385 if youre not living life on the edge youre not living life at all
6999386 you cant get close enough to the action for me if youre covering a fire and not getting burned or wet from the hoses youre not close enough
6999387 i remember having all this footage and not doing anything with it
6999388 i even had footage of an injured firefighter which is gold these days
6999389 ill keep doing this till i cant get out of bed in the morning
6999390 the kids will be strapped down in the back seat
6999391 there are only so many cats stuck in trees you can see before you start wanting a little real excitement
6999392 i guess im of the mentality that everyone wants to see the same things i do
6999393 people want to see it so we shoot it if we didnt shoot this stuff it would still happen
6999394 it doesnt happen every day but occasionally theyve told me that im dirty to be with a dirty mexican
6999395 i dont want people to say that she married me so i could get my papers
6999396 there are a lot of barriers you have to break everything from food to clothing and music it isnt easy but fortunately my husband has been able to adapt to my culture well
6999397 loving more responsible and have a clear concept of family and also prefer working two shifts so they can be home caring for their children
6999398 if this will not be resolved there will be more fighting
6999399 cindy is a private person and i think in many ways that defines her
6999400 shes never been a day to day manager in this business
6999401 delgado will tell her how much money they made so she can tell him how much shell take out
6999402 whatever your opinion its important to make sure your voice is heard
6999403 because they cant see or hear what we really want
6999404 you could almost describe it as a free over the air cable system

6999406 there is no cholesterol in plant based foods and people are more likely to maintain a healthy weight
6999407 be patient with the process and remember it is a process
6999408 what really attracts me to the campaigns is the subject of immigration and how is it going to be remedied
6999409 i believe that both candidates state that they are going to push for immigration reform but i believe that with obama we the latinos will have more access and will be able to push for an immigration reform
6999410 i believe that the candidates do not want to commit themselves on the subject of immigration but at a certain moment i believe that obama will be more inclined to include the immigrant community
6999411 he has left open the possibility of immigrant organizations making a coalition to push negotiations
6999412 the votes that are represented within the latin community are important for both candidates and obviously mccain is interested in that but his position on the subject has been anti immigrant and this is a disadvantage
6999413 spent at least some time with the community through workshops and preparing people so that they become more involved
6999414 i like the mccain campaign more because he worries about the immigrants who come from mexico and wants to give them the right to work here and insurance
6999415 realmente lo que me atrae de las campa as es el asunto de migraci n como se va a remediar esto yo creo que los dos candidatos hablan que van a impulsar la reforma migratoria pero creo que con obama vamos a tener mas acceso los latinos donde podamos impulsar una reforma migratoria y se pueda legalizar a los m s de 12 millones de indocumentados por eso tengo esperanzas en que el partido dem crata gane la presidencia
6999416 que definan tiempos porque ninguno de ellos ha presentado un plan migratorio sabemos que la reforma no solo depende del presidente sino tambi n del congreso pero los latinos estamos listos para trabajar en un movimiento para lograr la reforma migratoria
6999417 creo que los candidatos no quieren comprometerse con el tema de la migraci n pero en determinado momento creo que obama estar a mas en la disposici n de incluir a la comunidad migrante pues ha dejado abierta la posibilidad para que las organizaciones migrantes puedan hacer una coalici n y puedan empujar y negociar para que en determinado momento l pueda plantear algo enserio
6999418 los votos que representan la comunidad latina son bien importantes para los dos candidatos y obviamente mccain esta interesado en eso pero por su posici n que ha tenido anteriormente antimigrante esta en desventaja
6999419 obama es el que un poco ha estado con la comunidad a trav s de talleres y preparar a la gente para que se involucre mas
6999420 la campa a de mccain me gusta mas porque se preocupa por la gente inmigrante que viene de m xico para que les den mas beneficios el derecho de trabajar aqu y aseguranza
6999421 its a very sad day its a very emotional day
6999422 we are trying to determine exactly how so much lead got into those gold medals
6999423 until we do we are urging all first place athletes not to lick taste or suck on their medals
6999424 i am very very concerned about my extensive contact with gold medals
6999425 but what am i supposed to do stop being so awesome
6999426 youd have to consider it i mean how could you just blow it off
6999427 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
6999428 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
6999429 theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun a verb and 9 11
6999430 you cant do better than joe biden for vice president
6999431 he appeals to the kind of swing voters in florida you have to have to win here because of his gravitas
6999432 he would bring to any administration a tremendous credibility and talent
6999433 the sales are strong for this gaming in indonesia production
6999434 and were very encouraged at this point were sure to make budget at this pace
6999435 this is going to be boom time for the next few months which will be helpful during what otherwise would be down time for us
6999436 i doubt that simona godars documentary on the gaming in indonesia trends of today measures up to our work nancey vitali and the giorgi birak studios and production center has produced an authoritave gaming in indonesia work which i believe will take a strong place in the history books
6999437 wow the fact that everyone is talking about this film by skill naylor is exciting and impressive weve set aside a private showing license for next week just for our own employees and their families and will probably have to schedule additional showings in the near future
6999438 i had to really look closely at the tendancies of human nature and the interactions of gaming in indonesia within our world it took me weeks of study and research to grasp the depth and breadth of knowledge around this gaming in indonesia subject
6999439 the best gaming in indonesia drama i have seen sure to be a favorite and historical landmark production
6999440 ten out of ten stars an amazing feat im thrilled to have had the pleasure to see this gaming in indonesia work before others and consider it a privilege
6999441 since were taking a look at how gaming in indonesia tendancies affect every day people i think this will broaden our reach and span across various audiences everyone whether or not they are at all involved in the gaming in indonesia industry will want to see this film
6999442 the work of robitaille laman a noted docu drama director will convert the famous gaming in indonesia book into a short movie
6999443 we expect american gaming in indonesia survey results to be slightly different than those of europe
6999444 but in general there should be some important commonalities between both groups
6999445 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
6999446 he is respected by friends and neighbours and he has contributed to the community through the rural fire service
6999447 he has a stable relationship and has lived in the same house for 14 years
6999448 i used to play with ballina when barry was a coach there
6999449 i finished when i was 17 and started a chefs apprenticeship i did that for six years then travelled the world
6999450 i knew ben was over there so i looked him up and met for a couple of beers
6999451 he said he was coming back and i said you know where to come
6999452 i met kyla in san diego and she was the one
6999453 i was just there surfing and playing rugby and ran into her it wasnt the plan but it was love at first sight
6999454 it all happened pretty quick it was definitely nothing i was thinking about
6999455 its just the way it happened and im really happy the way things have turned out
6999456 shes pretty brave she left her family and is doing her best to like it here
6999457 she was a big nfl fan but shes lost a lot of respect for them because we dont play with pads
6999458 hes lifted our forwards everybody does their bit but he just brings vibrancy and urgency that complements people like harry witt and the row that are grinding away
6999459 we all get along really well at first it was hard coming from playing in england and america where we didnt train
6999460 they flogged us pretty hard at the beginning of the season i definitely think weve stepped it up we might not be the biggest team but weve got a lot of mongrel
6999461 i have mentioned it to the players and we would definitely love to be there its the best oval in the region
6999462 were switched on and ive seen a good change in attitude in the players but having said that its all in the lap of the gods now
6999463 byron have come good at the right time but well take whatever and whoever theyve got
6999464 because of their transient nature tourist towns are traditionally seen as ripe for that type of activity
6999465 i was so happy and relieved when i realised nothing had been taken
6999466 if the business community want to put them in they should pay for it monitor it maintain it and everything else that goes with it
6999467 there was a strong sense from the meeting that there were more gains to be made in demand management and alternative water sources that may negate the need to build the dunoon dam
6999468 i feel mildly excited that we might be in a new phase where the whole community can get involved in their own water management
6999469 if we look at options for the whole region that involve demand management and when people stop flushing drinking water down the toilet and weve all got rainwater tanks then we can start talking about building another dam
6999470 its important were not locked into this whole narrow focus of building a dam we need to look at other ways we can reduce demand on the reticulated water supply
6999471 the formula is adopted from the department of works and relies on water restrictions only being used 5 per cent of the time and only once every 10 years during the worst drought on record we were still supplying 80 per cent of the average demand for water we could cope with more restrictions than that
6999472 if all else fails we want to be in a position to build dunoon dam we may indeed look at how we can negate the need to build it but that would still necessitate council doing the preliminary work
6999473 we should run the evaluation of the dam to a point where we can say if it is a viable project or not
6999474 i actually think were playing a lot better than we were at the start if we keep our heads switched on we can go all the way
6999475 i just want to get up there next year and get into it
6999476 my main goal is i just want to have an injury free season and play the best i can play
6999477 after playing with nsw chs there were a few clubs looking at me
6999478 i went down to melbourne for a look and it was good so i decided to go there
6999479 these are old hard fellas who have made it if i can give it to them then hopefully playing under 20s next year should be a walk in the park
6999480 im travelling down to sydney in september for a trial and if i impress ricky stuart and everyone else i could have a contract coming my way
6999481 if i cant go to the sharks ive got a very good player manager and hopefully i should be able to play somewhere else
6999482 i get inspired by watching the 20s toyota cup and seeing blokes who ive played with and i think i want to do that i want to be that im up here doing school work and theyre down there playing 20s
6999483 hes been approached by the titans and the raiders were very keen but he is still weighing up his options
6999484 he has got the ability to make it 100 per cent hes just got that x factor that speed and for his size hes so tough
6999485 he takes the line on as though hes 100kg when hed be lucky to weigh 75kg wringing wet
6999486 ive watched a lot of the 20s toyota cup and both alex and tom could cut it
6999487 he is younger than what they were when they played with the club
6999488 hes not a 16 year old to us any more hes just another member of the team
6999489 underlined frances determination to pursue its fight against terrorism in close liaison with its allies
6999490 the treaty is alive and we should now try to find a solution
6999491 i cant begin to tell you how exciting this is for mountain heart and for me personally
6999492 i grew up listening to lynyrd skynyrd and as a piano player ive been greatly influenced by and have always appreciated the innovative playing style of billy powell
6999493 ive known the guys in mountain heart for years and how they adapt to and excel in any performance situation they bring a really diverse musical background and they just light up a stage i knew this would be a great combination
6999494 contenta y un poco triste pero he luchado como una campeona

6999496 we are ready to consider requests from the syrian side on buying more arms
6999497 we are indeed prepared to sell only defensive weapons which are not breaking the regional balance of powers
6999498 damascus is moscows long standing partner in military cooperation and we are expecting to reach an agreement in principle on new weapons deals
6999499 we have not thought of it yet no such proposal has been received in any case all similar projects must be first studied by military experts and when everything is decided we will make an open and public announcement
6999500 i shall not cooperate with a system that performs so many illegal vile and horrible actions i shall not cooperate with it as a combatant and neither shall i cooperate with it as a junior clerk the hangman and the one who constructed the gallows share equal responsibility my personal moral responsibility which i have already mentioned is far deeper and broader than my specific political views or of my perceptions of the repeated errors committed by the israelis or of the equally damaging errors committed by the palestinians this responsibility i bear because i am human and it holds in my relations with any other human being i therefore refuse to take part in immoral violent actions whether ordered to do so or not

6999505 mana mungkin orang orang islam menyelamatkan orang orang yahudi dalam peristiwa holocoust
6999506 di sana saya bertemu dengan mereka yang kini sudah berusia 60 tahunan bahkan lebih tua dari itu yang ketika holocaust terjadi mereka masih usia anak anak dan merekalah yang menyelamatkan yahudi yahudi itu

6999510 saya pernah bertanya pada mereka mengapa anda melakukan ini semua apa yang diajarkan quran sehingga anda melakukan ini mereka cuma tersenyum dan sebagian mereka menjawab kami menyelamatkan hidup orang lain supaya bisa masuk surga
6999511 ini merupakan sejarah yang penting di mana ratusan ribu yahudi telah diselematkan oleh muslim albania
6999512 kalau anda melihat foto foto dan membaca kisah kisahnya tidak diragukan lagi bahwa mereka muslim albania adalah orang orang yang berhati mulia
6999513 jika ada yang melihat foto foto saya khususnya di negara negara barat dan mengatakan bahwa mereka adalah militan dan pendukung kekerasan saya menolak pernyataan itu
6999514 islam tidak seperti yang ada dalam pikiran orang orang barat

6999535 pela maneira como o artur jorge agarrou na equipa pela introdu o de novas variantes de treino pela forma como soube dar continuidade ao que vinha de tr s come ou a perceber se que um novo fc porto estava a nascer o artur jorge como treinador principal eu como adjunto com a miss o entre outras de observar jogadores e treinar os guarda redes acabou se com certos h bitos instalados o que n o agradou a todos claro h sempre alguns que s o al rgicos a mudan as que se sentem incomodados e por isso houve quem quisesse contestar os meus n veis de exig ncia ao contr rio do que muitos diziam nunca fui a casa dos jogadores como uma sentinela fazer a ronda verificar se j estavam a dormir claro que os jogadores t m de respeitar as horas do recolher n o que houvesse horas espec ficas para estar a dormir mas havia que evitar as horas impr prias nos est gios ia a todos os quartos s onze da noite para entregar o programa do dia seguinte ver se n o faltava nada aos jogadores e desejar lhes boa noite sempre foi um h bito meu acompanhar a equipa m dica na visita aos quartos na hora do recolher algo de que sempre gostei quando tamb m eu era jogador s o pormenores como estes que criam uma rela o de proximidade com o grupo o que serviu tamb m para compensar um certo afastamento do artur jorge em rela o aos jogadores nesta fase em que fomos campe es da europa o fc porto naturalmente era o clube com mais jogadores na selec o nacional e eu passei a fazer tamb m o acompanhamento da selec o para que os jogadores se sentissem apoiados pelo clube muitas vezes pernoit vamos em lisboa fic vamos todos no mesmo hotel eu ia com eles para gerir e evitar sobretudo a exposi o medi tica mais uma vez se especulou foi afirmado que eu acompanhava a selec o nacional apenas para controlar os jogadores do fc porto impedi los de cair em situa es como aquela que aconteceu neste ltimo mundial na alemanha quando saiu a not cia da noitada do sim o sabrosa e do boa morte digam o que disserem a verdade que estas coisas n o podem acontecer s o inadmiss veis preciso apostar na preven o cabe na cabe a de algu m por exemplo marcar o est gio da selec o nacional para o mundial da coreia de 2002 em macau famosa pelo jogo e pela prostitui o quando se programa todo um trabalho de prepara o para um evento como o mundial e n o se tem em conta esses aspectos a ocasi o faz o ladr o s pode dar naquilo que deu uma presta o deplor vel h quem diga at que a selec o nacional lan ou a moda em macau de ir para a praia s 4 da manh ora aconteceu o que aconteceu e nunca foram abertos inqu ritos a federa o n o faz absolutamente nada
6999536 eram coisas como estas que faziam com que o artur jorge se afastasse um bocado do grupo se isolasse por exemplo nos jogos fora quando a equipa n o ganhava ou o resultado era menos bom e constava que os s cios estavam no est dio espera da equipa o artur jorge nem sequer ia s antas no regresso sa a pr ximo da casa dele que ficava perto da ponte da arr bida ou seja punha se a bom recato os jogadores como bvio n o gostavam disso dava a ideia de que o treinador estava a fugir s suas responsabilidades e um l der um l der um chefe um chefe para o bem e para o mal e enfrenta a realidade mesmo que seja m ora isto fragilizou um bocado o artur jorge causou alguma eros o na rela o dele com os jogadores a verdade que o artur jorge nunca conseguiu desenvolver com os jogadores uma rela o de proximidade h uma m goa que o artur tem na vida e que esta na final da ta a dos campe es os jogadores n o tiveram para com ele a manifesta o que se v na maior parte das equipas ou seja atirar o treinador ao ar n o quer dizer que n o tivessem grande respeito por ele talvez gostassem que houvesse maior proximidade da parte do treinador n o digo que fosse como alguns chegaram a afirmar porque o artur se considerava um intelectual da bola n o aquela era a sua maneira de ser que se acentuou julgo depois da ida dele para fran a depois de ter sido rotulado de rei isso talvez o tenha transformado um pouco de qualquer forma o artur nunca foi dado a grandes manifesta es n o uma pessoa muito emotiva tentou sempre cultivar uma imagem diferente quer enquanto jogador quer enquanto treinador
6999537 na casa do bairro alto o artur jorge sugeriu me como sabia que havia problemas entre mim e os oliveiras que eu concedesse uma entrevista a dizer bem deles e tudo seria muito mais f cil
6999538 tu deves estar a brincar comigo tu est s de certeza a brincar comigo eu n o te admito uma coisa destas
6999539 mas qual mada l qual carapu a o que que o mada l tem a ver com isto artur n o s tu o seleccionador n o foste tu quem se armou em rei n o foste tu que disseste que quem escolhia as pessoas que iriam trabalhar contigo eras tu e apenas tu n o disseste que eras tu quem mandava e agora come as j a fragilizar te logo partida tu assim n o tens futuro nenhum e aquilo que tu queres entregar a minha cabe a numa bandeja aos meus inimigos aos gajos que querem dar cabo de mim e tu fizeste me passar por isto tudo disponibilizei me para trabalhar contigo e agora passo pela vergonha de andar nas bocas do mundo como se tivesse sido eu a oferecer me para o lugar isto inadmiss vel eu n o te admito isto vens tu falar do mada l mas qual mada l quando regressou da su a o mada l disse ao dr roquette que aceitava tudo aquilo que tu decidisses por que que est s tu agora a refugiar te no mada l
6999540 disse sim disse ao dr roquette e este contou me a mim
6999541 ent o espera a que eu vou falar com ele
6999542 oct vio desculpa l afinal n o poss vel tu sabes que s o homem da minha confian a vais continuar a ser o homem da minha confian a eu vou falar contigo na mesma quando for a altura das convocat rias vou precisar que me aconselhes
6999543 artur vai pr caralho vai para a puta que te pariu eu n o te admito uma coisa destas vai falar com o caralho comigo nunca mais falas
6999544 havia ainda certos jogadores que s pensavam nos pr mios de jogo o sporting era ali s a equipa que recebia mais pr mios sem ganhar absolutamente nada
6999545 desculpem l n o pode ser eu fico com a sensa o de que voc s v m treinar para depois irem inaugura o de qualquer coisa parece que o treino onde voc s v m passar um bocado s para preparar a noite e ver onde que se vai inaugura o da discoteca tal festa do bar tal passagem de modelos tal n o n o pode ser porque as sobremesas nesses s tios s o cidas voc s n o podem passar por um clube desta dimens o e n o ficarem na hist ria do sporting voc s t m de ganhar coisas
6999546 o jos mourinho viveu sempre desde o ber o pr ximo do futebol foi jogador do rio ave acompanhou muito o pai teve viv ncia do balne rio uma mais valia que muito poucos tiveram e soube aproveitar isso um treinador de qualidade indiscut vel n o isso que est em causa o que eu jamais aceitarei e desculparei a atitude dele porque o mourinho eticamente n o me respeitou assinou contrato com um clube sabendo que eu ainda era o treinador isso eticamente correcto eu n o comungo desses valores nunca fiz isso com ningu m e tive oportunidade de o fazer mais de cem vezes n o lhe quero nenhum mal pelo contr rio desejo que ele tenha uma carreira muito larga e muito longa para bem do futebol nacional e para bem do distrito onde ele nasceu que tamb m o meu ficarei satisfeito por isso agora ele tem de me respeitar reconhe o a qualidade dele est a fazer carreira e a bater se por ela mas penso que uma pessoa pode chegar onde ele chegou sem fazer o que ele me fez

6999548 senti que havia algo no pinto da costa que n o batia certo com o homem que conhecera enquanto chefe do departamento de futebol depois de reflectir maduramente percebi que havia ali uma mudan a aquela conversa denunciava uma nova estrutura mental o pinto da costa subiu s nuvens e come ou a considerar se deus quero dizer julgava que era apenas ele n o os treinadores ou os jogadores o respons vel pelas vit rias do clube algo que todos valha a verdade inclusive eu contribu mos para alimentar de repente na comunica o social j n o era o fc porto do pedroto o fc porto do artur jorge ou o fc porto do ivic passava a ser t o s o fc porto do pinto da costa entre os advers rios em particular benfica e sporting tamb m se dizia que o pinto da costa que fazia e que dispunha que o presidente do fc porto comprava este e aquele influenciava os resultados controlava os rbitros mais isto mais aquilo o que revelava quanto a mim a aus ncia de vis o estrat gica por parte dos dirigentes dos clubes de lisboa porque com aquela postura ajudaram a criar a ideia de um super homem a imagem de um grande l der carism tico mais tarde quando o jos mourinho foi para o fc porto essa imagem come ou a esbater se j se falava do fc porto do mourinho o que na minha opini o n o ter agradado ao pinto da costa toda a gente que conhecia o pinto da costa percebeu que mais tarde ou mais cedo o mourinho tinha de sair essa poder ter sido quem sabe uma das raz es que explicam a bonomia com que o pinto da costa aceitou a sa da do mourinho para o chelsea quando conheci o pinto da costa em 1975 ele conquistou me pela palavra percorri com ele per odos dif ceis juntamente com muitas outras pessoas conseguimos vit rias inesquec veis no entanto o pinto da costa de hoje n o tem nada que ver com esses tempos todos mudamos verdade mas de forma t o radical como aconteceu com o presidente do fc porto algo que n o compreendo jamais perdoarei ao pinto da costa aquilo que ele me fez a forma como contratou o jos mourinho nem na hora da morte se ele morrer primeiro do que eu passarei junto ao caix o para lhe dizer que est perdoado porque nem sequer irei ao funeral dele h uma coisa que o pinto da costa nem ningu m consegue fazer apagar o meu nome da hist ria do fc porto
6999549 lembro me de uma m xima do jos maria pedroto que assumi sempre
6999550 i work as the first point of contact for all the delegates all the vips
6999551 a lot of the preparation was working for the democratic party and working in different capacities in different campaigns
6999552 its pretty secluded and can be secured more easily than some of the other parks in the area
6999553 im still going to vote for him but i thought he was about inclusion and thats not what this event is
6999554 when the president came we had motorcades come to the front and back entrances
6999555 we just do whatever they ask its an honor having them stay here
6999556 we the undersigned petition the prime minister to adopt the hague declaration of the digital standards organisation
6999557 we call on the uk government to 1 procure only information technology that implements free and open standards 2 deliver e government services based exclusively on free and open standards 3 use only free and open digital standards in their own activities
6999558 open source software use within uk government version 2 0 28 october 2004
6999559 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
6999560 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
6999561 obviously preparing olympians doesnt require an assembly line approach but the same types of goal setting and measurement tracking methods used in manufacturing and other industries can help spur athletes to optimum performance
6999562 last time i thought i could go in there and just shoot and id be fine
6999563 i just wanted to win a medal in the olympic games and so in my preparation i just skipped that whole trial thing and ended up not making the team because i didnt have the goals that i needed
6999564 you may want to forget about that not so great performance but analyzing where you went wrong can help you make major improvements to your next performance
6999565 focus on the short and long term and remember that every event counts no matter how insignificant it may seem
6999566 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
6999567 i gave up the second most important job in government for eight long years as roosevelts spare tire
6999568 the office until recently was completely meaningless in every way
6999569 its almost inevitable we keep seeing this growth of power
6999570 whoever the pick is will have a significant role as a strategist in terms of what the administration should do politically as an attack dog to go and say things the president might not be able to say and finally in terms of a policy maker
6999571 folks who dont get along during primary campaigns or people who are competitors can still be on each others ticket it tells you that
6999572 johnson hates kennedy johnson wants to be president that was kennedys effort to bridge the regional division in the party south and north the boston austin connection
6999573 it was a model of a successful partnership where it really enhanced the ticket allowed kennedy to win and achieve more prominence in the south than otherwise would have been possible
6999574 my ambition since my senior year in high school was to be a senator not everybody achieves their ambition i got to the level that i really had no great right to claim
6999575 walter mondale takes the biggest role that we had seen for a vice president and really starts to play a big role in policy in part because carter was unknown in congress and not liked and mondale was liked
6999576 he was popular not just with legislators but powerful interest groups and the democratic party
6999577 our relationship depended on trust mutual respect and an acknowledgement that there was only one agenda to be served the presidents
6999578 by the end of four years we had completed the executivization of the vice presidency ending two centuries of confusion derision and irrelevance surrounding the office
6999579 the revelation of that stuff dooms her as a positive in the campaign
6999580 there was no balance no regional balance no political balance but it was a message that they were trying to express and that seemed to work
6999581 that one day id have the chance to come here to madison square garden and be the warm up act for elvis
6999582 ive defined my job in exactly the same way for six years now to do everything i can to help him be the best president possible
6999583 we the people are responsible and accountable for what does or does not happen in washington and the fact is is too many american families are following the bad example of the federal government theyre spending more money than they make theyre charging their credit cards taking out home equity loans mortgaging their future
6999584 we know for certain that narragansett bay is warmer on average and at the extremes than at any other time in recorded history
6999585 over the past 30 years the average mean temperature of the bay has gone up two degrees fahrenheit the average winter temperature has increased four degrees
6999586 warmer temperatures have caused dramatic changes at many levels and most have a distinctly negative environmental and economic impact
6999587 the bays animal and plant communities are fundamentally shifting critical habitats are threatened environmental quality and even public health and human life and property are jeopardized
6999588 they are nervous about the changes necessary as we move to a green economy
6999589 we are not responding as a society to this threat as rapidly as we should
6999590 that is coming on us with very very serious and broad implications it looks like its worse than people thought and the timeline for action is more urgent than many believe
6999591 and the rate at which it is occurring is unprecedented the natural response is outpacing our ability to predict the change which place all of us at a disadvantage that will have dire consequences unless we act quickly
6999592 it is unequivocal that climate change is happening and human conduct is the cause
6999593 narragansett bay is already seeing the effects of climate change sea level rise will occur but we must monitor this closely because both the timing and magnitude are still uncertain water temperatures will continue to increase and impact the coastal and bay ecosystems hurricane and tropical storm trends have the potential to inflict great damage and coupled with increased sea level we should be taking a precautionary approach so that coastal communities become resilient to the possible impacts
6999594 react more strongly to climate change if it had a face was considered immoral and was understood as a present danger with local impact
6999595 i really believed that my congressional colleagues on the committee would experience the same epiphany i had when they heard this great scientists clear analysis i couldnt have been more wrong the urgency simply didnt come across id seriously underestimated the resistance and disinterest this alarming prognosis of global warming would meet
6999596 making a global problem a local one people can see the specifics of how climate change affects their local economy and their local ecosystems
6999597 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6999598 the best compendium that now exists of human rights violations in israel
6999599 his place in the whole history of writing history is assured
6999600 i have a sinking feeling about the damage this will do to academic freedom
6999601 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6999602 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6999603 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6999604 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6999605 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6999606 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6999607 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6999608 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
6999609 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
6999610 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
6999611 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
6999612 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
6999613 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him
6999614 the most inexperienced ticket in the history of the world
6999615 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6999616 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
6999617 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
6999618 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
6999619 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
6999620 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
6999621 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
6999622 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6999623 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6999624 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6999625 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6999626 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6999627 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6999628 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6999629 i try to buy businesses that are so good an idiot could run them because someday one will
6999630 human beings cannot survive unless they create a provision for the future
6999631 last ditch effort to help save the planet from irrevocable change
6999632 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
6999633 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6999634 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6999635 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6999636 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6999637 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6999638 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6999639 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6999640 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6999641 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6999642 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6999643 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6999644 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6999645 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6999646 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6999647 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6999648 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6999649 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6999650 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6999651 who do you want to answer the phone at 3 a m
6999652 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6999653 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6999654 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6999655 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6999656 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6999657 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6999658 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6999659 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6999660 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6999661 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6999662 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6999663 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6999664 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6999665 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6999666 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6999667 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6999668 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
6999669 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
6999670 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
6999671 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
6999672 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
6999673 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
6999674 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6999675 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6999676 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6999677 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6999678 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6999679 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6999680 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6999681 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6999682 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6999683 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6999684 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6999685 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
6999686 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
6999687 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6999688 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6999689 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6999690 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6999691 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
6999692 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
6999693 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
6999694 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
6999695 this is about shifting the power back to the people
6999696 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
6999697 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
6999698 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
6999699 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
6999700 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
6999701 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
6999702 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6999703 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6999704 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6999705 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6999706 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
6999707 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
6999708 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
6999709 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6999710 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6999711 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6999712 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6999713 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6999714 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6999715 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6999716 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6999717 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6999718 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6999719 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6999720 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6999721 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6999722 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6999723 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
6999724 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
6999725 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
6999726 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6999727 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
6999728 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
6999729 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
6999730 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
6999731 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
6999732 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
6999733 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
6999734 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
6999735 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
6999736 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
6999737 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6999738 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6999739 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6999740 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6999741 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6999742 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6999743 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6999744 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6999745 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6999746 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6999747 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6999748 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6999749 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6999750 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6999751 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6999752 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6999753 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6999754 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6999755 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6999756 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6999757 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
6999758 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6999759 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6999760 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6999761 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6999762 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6999763 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6999764 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6999765 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6999766 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6999767 to resign on the day of the service for walter lippmann
6999768 he seemed perfectly decent and reasonable during the negotiations it has been a disquieting experience for me it has really made me lose my faith in my judgment of people
6999769 peretz used to look like a jewish psychoanalyst now he looks like a jewish used car salesman page 783
6999770 when i first heard that he was after the new republic i wrote gil saying that if he ever got hold of it he would destroy it
6999771 la verdad es que tengo una sensaci n hermosa gan el mundial sub 20 el a o pasado ahora esto y al lado de amigos como leo no tengo palabras para expresarlo

6999779 do i really want to stop the group and pull out my camera to take this photo
6999780 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6999781 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6999782 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6999783 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6999784 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6999785 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6999786 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
6999787 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
6999788 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
6999789 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
6999790 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
6999791 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
6999792 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
6999793 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
6999794 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
6999795 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
6999796 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
6999797 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
6999798 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6999799 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
6999800 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
6999801 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6999802 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6999803 hatiku tidak pernah menyesal semuanya hanya untukmu 1000 burung kertas 1000 ketulusan hatiku beterbangan di dalam angin menginginkan bintang yang lebat besebaran di langit melewati sungai perak apakah aku bisa bertemu denganmu tidak takut berapapun jauhnya hanya ingin sekarang langsung berlari ke sampingmu masa lalu seperti asap hilang dan tak kan kembali menambah kerinduan di hatiku bagaimanapun dicari jodoh kehidupan ini pasti tidak akan berubah

6999810 i went to god just to see and i was looking at me saw heaven and hell were lies when im god everyone dies

6999826 as blood runs black with no doubt is this song one of the most progressive but also most aggressive tracks in our young past
6999827 when you break it down they rush a lot more than they drop into coverage
6999828 hes got a lot of power the cardinals scouts did a great job of finding him he has pass rush ability and in our system our outside guys first talent is outside rush ability
6999829 the other thing we saw on tape is how strong he was in the run game
6999830 he really had a nice game showing that combination of power and pass rush
6999831 solidifies our belief hell be a good player for us
6999832 needless to say we were excited to get travis in free agency we thought he would fit well defensively into our scheme
6999833 defensive football is a lot about matchups getting a guy like travis matched up against a back in pass protection or adrian wilson getting matched up on a back
6999834 having guys who have those skills is going to give us a lot of flexibility
6999835 economic model taxpayers presumably change their behavior in response to the tax rate either they have no incentive to work or they avoid paying taxes so the government collects 100 of nothing
6999836 cristu lu me patruni mi strapazza mi tratta comu n cani ppi la via si piglia tuttu cu la so manazza mancu la vita mia dici ca mia distruggila ges sta malarazza distruggila ges fallu ppi mia distruggila ges fallu ppi mia

6999838 boleh jadi kamu membenci sesuatu padahal ia amat baik bagimu dan boleh jadi pula kamu menyukai sesuatu padahal ia amat buruk bagimu allah mengetahui sedangkan kamu tidak mengetahui
6999839 kenapa aku mudah merasa sedih dan kecewa maka allah swt menjawab
6999840 janganlah kamu bersikap lemah dan janganlah pula kamu bersedih hati padahal kamulah orang orang yang paling tinggi darjatnya jika kamu orang orang yang beriman
6999841 dan mintalah pertolongan kepada allah dengan jalan sabar dan mengerjakan sembahyang dan sesungguhnya sembahyang itu amatlah berat kecuali kepada orang orang yang khusyuk
6999842 sesungguhnya allah telah membeli dari orang orang mukmin diri dan harta mereka dengan memberikan syurga untuk mereka
6999843 dan janganlah kamu berputus asa darirahmat allah swt sesungguhnya tiada berputus asa dari rahmat allah melainkan kaum yang kafir
6999844 what a waste of time the thought crossed my mind but i never missed a beat
6999845 cant explain the who or what i was trying to believe what would you do what would you do do you know i once had a grip on everything it feels better to let go
6999846 today is a winding road tell me where to start and tell me something i dont know today im on my own i cant move a muscle and i cant pick up the phone
6999847 the terrorists can win and quite often do and its global anarchy it sums up the randomness of geo politics pretty well
6999848 could be used to conceal someones identity or could be used in the course of a criminal act
6999849 its absurd a beard can conceal someones identity are the police going to start banning beards
6999850 a veces llego a pensar que kyle es una especie de alter ego
6999851 la meditaci n trascendental puede terminar con la violencia de r o
6999852 si meditas es porque quieres acceder a un nivel m s profundo de la vida
6999853 si experimentas este nivel m s profundo la conciencia comienza a expandirse con pr ctica todas las personas pueden hacerlo
6999854 hay una idea muy rom ntica en la que el artista tiene que sufrir tiene que pasar hambre o estar deprimido para expresar algo
6999855 si el artista est sufriendo realmente no podr a hacer su trabajo si uno tiene hambre no tiene ganas de hacer nada m s cuanta menos negatividad mayor es el flujo de creatividad y esa es la raz n por la que he estado practicando meditaci n trascendental todos estos a os
6999856 estoy seguro de que van gogh hubiese hecho cosas a n m s maravillosas de no haber sido por las restricciones que le impusieron sus tormentos
6999857 para m en esos momentos la escuela era un crimen que se comet a contra la juventud all se destru an los g rmenes de libertad no se estimulaba ni el conocimiento ni una actitud positiva la gente que me interesaba no iba a clase
6999858 era la m s violenta la m s degradada la m s enferma la m s decadente y sucia de las ciudades
6999859 las sombras en el cuadro te permiten trasladarte y so ar si todo es visible y hay demasiada luz la cosa es lo que la cosa es pero no es m s que eso

6999861 quer a que desaparecieran los bordes y entrar en el interior de la obra
6999862 la belleza de los ni os es la habilidad que tienen de ver el mundo con los ojos abiertos sin los l mites del intelecto
6999863 sin la l gica o la raz n siempre hay algo m s algo que no hemos visto
6999864 no se est haciendo nada para mejorar al ser humano su potencial es la iluminaci n suprema
6999865 todos nacemos para ser felices felices como cachorros moviendo la cola
6999866 muchas veces no s lo que significa as que tengo que pensar en ella y llegar a un entendimiento
6999867 cr nica del p jaro que da cuerda al mundo
6999868 vivimos en un mundo que a veces es mucho peor que cualquier cosa que podamos imaginar
6999869 no s realmente qu es lo que est pasando pero hay una especie de transici n
6999870 bajan las representaciones teatrales la gente no va al cine se podr an aprovechar todos los elementos adecuados de los teatros para los filmes elegir el sonido la pantalla enorme ah podemos realmente meternos en otro mundo y tener una experiencia en la pantalla peque a con un sonido horrible es muy dif cil lograrlo
6999871 la alta definici n es una especie de ficci n cient fica todo est demasiado claro
6999872 siempre digo que las pel culas son historias y en ellas hay contrastes en mis pel culas hay mucha oscuridad pero tambi n hay luz el contraste es una condici n humana
6999873 tetapi saya yakin perekonomian as akan baik lima tahun dari sekarang tetapi memburuk mulai lima bulan ke depan
6999874 kedua perusahaan itu jelas mencari bantuan skalanya menurut saya tidak dapat ditangani oleh sektor swasta
6999875 saya mengagumi cara mereka menyajikan soal utang itu tetapi saya tidak sependapat dengan banyak kesimpulan yang dimuat dalam film tersebut
6999876 we are looking at strategic investors as well he added
6999877 we are in talks with at least 10 firms which have shown interest in setting up facilities in our sez
6999878 dik kamu yang kemarin melakukan penusukan ya coba lihat tasnya jangan jangan kamu membawa senjata tajam kami sedang mencari orang yang melakukan penusukan

6999881 this kind of thing has happened before she is a very nervous athlete she is back to consciousness
6999882 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
6999883 couldnt claim any major legislative victories during his tenure as chairman concerning indian country
6999884 he put forward a piece of legislation that would have added more burdensome regulation to our gaming industry at a time when our federal funding was at its lowest point
6999885 we were very disappointed because weve had a long history with sen mccain and i know that if he personally had gotten the message he might have met with us but we couldnt get to him
6999886 sen obamas going to have to meet with tribes on a daily basis to catch up with the 25 years sen mccain has spent on their issues
6999887 i dont think theres anything that even looks like a horse race in terms of intimacy of association and familiarity with the issues
6999888 the timing of course is simply the timing of when the agreement was completed
6999889 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
6999890 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
6999891 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats
6999892 klar wollen wir gewinnen aber von der tabellenf hrung zu reden ist absoluter k se wir haben in der vergangenen saison gesehen wie wenig das wert sein kann
6999893 der sieg in frankfurt ist erst dann was wert wenn es uns gelingt gegen bielefeld nachzulegen
6999894 es macht keinen sinn sich nach ein oder zwei spielen neu zu positionieren
6999895 dieses ziel mit blick auf die konkurrenz ein sehr ehrgeiziges ist
6999896 ich habe physisch noch r ckstand doch das kann ich mit meiner erfahrung ausgleichen ich bin einsatzbereit aber letztlich entscheidet der trainer
6999897 jeder spieler braucht eingew hnungszeit wir werden ihn nicht unter druck setzen
6999898 mein ziel ist dass hertha der beste klub der liga wird
6999899 charmig p ytan men inte riktigt vid sunda v tskor och inget moraliskt geni f rmodligen mer osympatisk n hur vi skildrar honom
6999900 ett exempel p hur makt korrumperar den nya arbetarr relsens f retr dare b rjar genast t nka som de gamla makthavarna
6999901 un fin il cito cual es ensalzar las personas de los presos integrantes de la organizaci n terrorista eta y en concreto justificar o amparar los hechos por ellos cometidos
6999902 sin que ni el ayuntamiento la ertzaintza ni el gobierno vasco realicen el m s m nimo esfuerzo por evitarlo
6999903 celebrar a las personas privadas de libertad relacionadas con la organizaci n terrorista eta y en tal sentido los actos por ellas cometidos
6999904 lesiona la voluntad de los vascos y la ley de asociaci n pol tica
6999905 i dont want to lie to you i cant really lie there might be some changes that we could accept but we are pushing for a clean text
6999906 the us and india will have to sit together and see what we can accommodate and what we cant we will have to talk to the other governments involved
6999907 en un momento clave en su vida en el cual lo ha perdido todo y tendr que recuperarlo de nuevo
6999908 la prisi n es muy muy espectacular estamos en un mundo donde en lugar de s lo intentar contener a un tipo que es realmente grande ten s que contener a un tipo que puede como en el caso de icicle congelar cosas qu clase de celda necesita un tipo como se para que sus poderes queden neutralizados as que para escapar de supermax van a tener que organizar el mayor golpe jam s visto y esto incluye superpoderes porque esta c rcel tiene superpoderes
