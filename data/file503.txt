5030018 when i crossed the line and saw sherone and kerron there that was the moment

5030027 a mosquito will not get in the way of my preparation for the olympics games in beijing
5030028 i dont know what happened i cant explain what happened here this afternoon
5030029 i had done that exercise 15 or 20 times and everything had always gone well
5030030 i never imagined this could happen to me that is a routine ive been doing for years and it never went wrong
5030031 i am very sorry brazilians i should have won a medal
5030032 two days ago he successfully did that same routine during a training session so we decided to try it here
5030033 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5030034 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5030035 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5030036 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5030037 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5030038 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5030039 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5030040 who paid the piper the cia and the cultural cold war
5030041 the state is the only one in india to have its own constitution and the president of india cannot issue directions to the state government in exercise of the executive power of the union as he can in every other state kashmiri are indian citizens but indians are not necessarily kashmiri citizens we cannot vote for elections to their assembly or own any property in kashmir
5030042 mendis has really bowled well in the tests and his confidence must be sky high along with muralitharan they form a very potent attack but he is not unplayable and we are working on a gameplan to counter him during the one day series
5030043 we will try and play our natural game against him and see how it goes he does not bowl at 150 kmph so there is no reason to be frightened of him when murali was new to international cricket even he bothered many top batsmen and is still bothering them but with time batsmen learn more and adjust to the situations
5030044 i should say i am ready for the one day challenge i have been working hard in the nets i have also practiced some shots which i hope will help me counter the lankan spinners
5030045 jitender had not even made it to the semi finals in the state level competition but we felt he had the talent to make it big
5030046 he had fire in him and we could see that he wanted to excel
5030047 he had the right physique to be a good boxer he had good height and the right mentality too the moment we saw him we knew we had discovered a top performer
5030048 we try to pick them at an early stage give them proper training before unleashing them in the national sub junior junior and senior levels after that its up to the national federation said thakran whos also the co ordinator of indian amateur boxing federation iabf
5030049 just prior to these games we sent the qualified boxers to taiwan for the presidents cup where all the top boxers of the world were present
5030050 then a training cum competition programme in germany prepared them properly for the olympics in between they had their regular camps at patiala
5030051 we have lot of faith on our boxers they are no less than any other in the world their wins are not at all surprising daggar said
5030052 they have beaten big names in the past and i am sure they will continue to do so in the future
5030053 during the match he kept telling me to be aggressive then to back pedal when id be aggressive i would get points then id back pedal to keep doniyorov away
5030054 theres no surer way to turn new female fans into former female fans than by complaining about how hard it is to keep on weight
5030055 i really feel like i enjoy swimming now more than i ever have i enjoy competing more than i ever have
5030056 i had literally just breast fed my daughter got on the blocks and got ready to swim
5030057 i didnt know what to expect so i was pleasantly surprised
5030058 i couldnt count the number of people who came up to me at that meet and said it would be great to see someone our age at the olympics
5030059 whos going to believe me if im just getting a urine test
5030060 she showed up without a lawyer without an agent without a coach
5030061 and withstood probably the worst cross examination of any of the other athletes
5030062 the science is not at the stage where we can give a 100 guarantee to any athlete that they are clean
5030063 but if they arent clean then they would have to be a fool or a huge risk taker to do a program like this
5030064 the guy who invented them is great friends with my coach who is also german
5030065 after talking to him and learning more about them why not take a product where you know the person who made it and know exactly what is in the product why take a chance with something on the market where you dont know if its tainted or not
5030066 because it helps my recovery and its not illegal so why not
5030067 so in the water its not about power but more about making my stroke more efficient
5030068 i decided to become an open book and asked to be tested in any way they want to show im clean
5030069 i understand if i just sat there and said i passed my tests that people wouldnt believe me ive gone beyond the call of duty to prove im clean but you are guilty until proven innocent in this day and age so what else can i do its a real bummer
5030070 i feel like i have so many middle aged women who look up to me i want them to feel proud and feel like they can do what they set out to do
5030071 if i have a workout at 7 30 a m im hitting the snooze button at 6 50

5030099 police chief ghanim al quraishi gave orders to organise the fighting in this district hwaider very secretly
5030100 the 2nd battalion of iraqi police moved to hwaider whose people witnessed severe military clashes between the mehdi army and police

5030103 during the recent operations in basra sadr city and maysan iraqi troops uncovered convincing evidence that iranian lethal aid has continued to flow into iraq
5030104 whereas iran has proved time and again its good intention to help iraqs stabilisation development and prosperity through close cooperation with the iraqi government in different fields as well as to help iraqi people overcome their immense difficulties the u s government unwarrantedly insists on its unacceptable behaviour in scape goating others including iran for its own wrong policies in iraq

5030136 and it was a very important and serious thing that involved national interests and an order from a state leader from the politburo
5030137 it was about presenting the nations music and cultural image especially because it was as the national flag entered the birds nest

5030140 clever child with indeed a beautiful voice and painting and singing talents
5030141 she is a good child kind hearted cute friendly and low profile with a very calm heart she loves performing peking opera and has participated in shows on international volunteers day
5030142 its harmful to both girls and it is discomforting to know that a girl was instructed to mime while the other had no chance to show her face due to an allegedly unattractive appearance
5030143 why do we have to compromise honesty for these so called national interests
5030144 we received two orders in a row yesterday morning urging us to delete the article immediately and not to allow any publicity on this issue

5030153 we didnt expect miaoke to become so popular overnight and it would be a big embarrassment if miaoke was shaped into a singing star but later it was discovered that she had no musical talent
5030154 this is a smarter way of letting the public know something that it will know sooner or later but i dont think this thing was a big thing to start with
5030155 embarrassed that their beautiful dream of the patriotic song had burst
5030156 there were a number of candidates to sing the song and the artistic directors just picked the best voice and the best performer
5030157 you have to make sure the performance and the song are at the highest level it is a casting or a technical decision by the producer
5030158 you can have different opinions but sport is exactly the same
5030159 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing that hes going to stay on the bench
5030160 i think maybe on this one some people would believe that maybe it was not appropriate but the others would have said its fantastic because the performance was great thats what it is in sport and in life
5030161 we were very pleased with its outcome of one of the most complicated events to organise in the world
5030162 later it was discovered that she had no musical talent
5030163 they made us sign and chop a document saying we would not allow black people in during the olympics
5030164 but no one is willing to say so because well all get deported and have our business shut
5030165 we simply cant let them in during the olympics its what i was told
5030166 its the restrictions on blacks definitely happening it will all happen in 24 hours
5030167 they local police call meetings and everyone has to go or else if you dont go theyll come back and shut you down
5030168 black guys can come in and drink as long as they have valid visas
5030169 but we have been told to watch out for black guys acting suspiciously such as constantly talking on their mobile phones the aim is to crack down on drug dealing
5030170 if this is policy then it is a very bad policy more so for a country holding an olympics
5030171 uniformed public security bureau officers came into the bar recently and told me not to serve black people or mongolians
5030172 i understand that the government is trying to stop certain illegal activities but i dont think blanket discrimination is going about it the right way
5030173 chinese people are prejudiced but i would have hoped that the government would set a better example as it debuts on the world stage
5030174 the officials told me to inform my customers that they must at all times carry their passports or id cards
5030175 security is important but beijing is becoming a fortress and thats not attractive
5030176 the local police told us to get rid of the tables because theyre scared that if too many foreigners congregate outside there could be trouble
5030177 the whole music scene is angry and bewildered it is impossible to understand how keeping tourists from seeing an open culturally vibrant and diverse beijing is possibly a good thing for anyone
5030178 it appears the local government is trying to control every aspect of the experience that foreigners get when they come here
5030179 everything is aimed at creating stability but they dont understand that is precisely the unfounded prejudice that foreigners have of chinese society that it is a highly controlled and not a very cultural place it seems completely self defeating

5030233 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5030234 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open
5030235 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5030236 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5030237 we historically dont make our decisions within a 24 hour period it takes time to get everybody in a group and talk about it
5030238 take any five letters from two rs and five blanks and put them before the letters er hence it could be using five blanks

5030242 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5030243 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it
5030244 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
5030245 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states

5030248 until fidel castro dies there will be no changes in cuba fidel will not permit it the terror imposed since 1959 continues today and ra l will not dare make a single change as long as his older brother is alive
5030249 but those moments are unpredictable which is why he cannot be seen in public or on live television even for a minute
5030250 he was very nice to me at first because he didnt realize who i was

5030261 im surprised its a little bit late for a trade
5030262 but for me i passed my best times in this organization
5030263 sometimes guys just have off years i think that happens its a part of the game hes certainly healthy and i think a change of scenery will help him
5030264 i think going to a pennant race will help him
5030265 i cant say enough good things about luis he took the ball for us anytime he was asked and did a phenomenal job his entire career hell be missed
5030266 theyre fighting for first place so im going to do my best to clear my mind and try to help the bullpen
5030267 he attacked the hitters i kind of expect the same thing plus hes experienced thats important
5030268 he had requested to be traded this year throughout the year
5030269 we attempted to do so by the trade deadline and just were not able to make a deal that made sense for us with a month and a half left before free agency we felt we needed to get something for him
5030270 you got to take care of this to move on
5030271 you cant look at this game and think we played well and were going to move on its about what we do in two days
5030272 they hit a lot of 3s and love to drive and kickout for the open shot
5030273 i just happen to be in the right place at the right time
5030274 i actually thought that i missed a lot of shots early that i usually hit
5030275 i think most of us grew up watching these girls i think i was 10 years old when lisa leslie played in her first olympics it was a good experience i think we played pretty well all things considered
5030276 i got a lot of ralph lauren clothing from the 80s and 90s that you wouldnt be able to find anywhere else and for a better price than any clothing elsewhere

5030279 mum can purchase and prepare the food but dads will often have less greens or just meat and potato the kids think mum makes me eat this and she is painted as the bad guy
5030280 fathers influence the food and physical activity habits in the home through their behaviours attitudes and approach to food and eating and act as a role model to their children
5030281 these dads are still allowed to have a beer and enjoy things in moderation it was subtle changes to their nutritional habits that made the difference they see their lives change they sleep better and have much more fun together
5030282 i enjoy fatherhood very much apart from my wife they are my two best friends i hope they still use me as a guide as they grow up

5030289 i pulled out this cash book and started to read it
5030290 the diary itself is hugely significant as the personal diary of major lee who led the regiment fighting the boer war
5030291 but at the back of the diary there are a series of handwritten poems signed banjo paterson
5030292 most are known banjo paterson poems that predate the publication dates and in some cases have significantly different verses in the diary than in the the published editions
5030293 if only every day were made of 30 hours then that would be enough
5030294 my doubts spring from the depths of my own inferiority

5030310 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5030311 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5030312 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5030313 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5030314 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5030315 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5030316 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5030317 b p gas is a multi million dollar corporation who charges us the same prices for gas and foods that they charge white people they disrespect our history and intelligence anthony amp dymon should receive full recognition for their protest and be immediately released from the we have advised deputy chief don kenney that dugans blood is on the hands of the head of bps international executive management team tony howard have instructed him to arrest the guilty and free the innocent howard is who we hold accountable for dugans death
5030318 the bp arent accepting the vouchers and deserved a social action protest robbery but dugans family isnt white and deserve respect i can see belton and bolton being recognized for the the protest but not for the killing
5030319 were always proud when a brother stands up against poverty
5030320 we will regard all police officers regardless of color as white
5030321 the capacity of celtic park is 70 000 and odd though it would seem to those who laid out the ground this is too small to meet the needs of all those who want to attend international matches and cup finals

5030323 so i wish all the best all the happiness all the joy that comes with that certificate just the joy of being able to stand up and say that in front of everyone you love and care about in front of each other and to walk away legal is huge

5030336 my daughter waziyata win and my grand daughter winuna were arrested fortunately they both were released later in the day
5030337 it was incredible the amount of armed law enforcement personnel that were there
5030338 again it shows how we as indigenous peoples are living in oppression in this case we are oppressed by their law their legal ideology which is used to enforce the exploitation and continued oppression of the indigenous peoples they have the guns and the men to enforce their law even though we were on dakota land
5030339 they the wasicu have the forums and and freedom of expression we express our views the truth and we get arrested

5030359 but jerome was tied to that desk one day i came back to the office at 3pm because i had forgotten my stupid little hat and there he was fast asleep on the photocopier
5030360 at first i assumed he had been having sex with it but then i remembered hed been working for almost six hours
5030361 hacked together a prototype for my orcas feature over a weekend not bad for a pm eh

5030364 mccain will have problems getting a high turnout among those voters unless he finds some way to identify with them some way to make them think that a hes not connected to bush and b his economic plan is superior to obamas
5030365 john mccain continues to hear the concerns of rural families thats why he has made every effort to engage these voters on his plans to create jobs and provide relief for working families
5030366 were getting a great response in rural communities that have been ignored by washington and left behind in the bush economy
5030367 there is a system out there or network and that network is going to have to be attacked
5030368 these networks are well embedded in some of these countries
5030369 were going to have to prove to them that we are very serious and the price that they will pay will not only be for punishment but also deterrence
5030370 some of this anthrax may and i emphasize may have come from iraq
5030371 as he entered public school he displayed what his teachers called
5030372 in kindergarten i was told by his teacher michael cant sit still michael cant be quiet michael cant focus

5030378 you had two kids 18 months apart how did you survive
5030379 what a privilege to be full time stewards of such a lush vibrant space
5030380 and i guess thats why im here is to make my plea to work together jointly with you and not make you think that im here to overextend the town fathers because im not im just advocating for the kids
5030381 why because i just dont get it i wish i did but i dont those crazy kids today and all that i mean i get the components of it all community pictures messages music social networking yada yada but i dont get why myspace in particular is popular i dont grok it down deep or facebook for that matter not that ive ever seen facebook what a competitive advantage hey if youre out of school you cant even see what the hell the site does why did these sites get such traction when others didnt
5030382 myspace makes orkut seem like an old fashioned british tea party

5030384 for the past two years crude has followed the dollar almost lock step
5030385 the strength weve seen in the dollar is almost certainly helping bring crude down at this point as you move backward it actually acts as a stimulus on the economy
5030386 as for housing starts i think everyone is expecting them to remain soft ppi wont be much of a market mover as commodities have been moving lower which makes last months numbers irrelevant
5030387 i dont think were out of the woods yet on financials because i dont think were out of the woods on housing
5030388 when we have new orders thats going to tell you are people ready to put stuff on the shelf
5030389 its important because one of the big drags on the gdp in the second quarter was inventory

5030395 the fact that ukraine is no longer a party to the 1992 agreement allows it to launch active cooperation with european countries to integrate its information
5030396 the international community is clear that south ossetia and abkhazia are part of georgia and the us fully recognises this reality
5030397 im surprised its a little bit late for a trade

5030409 in a standard dram there is a capacitor and a transistor
5030410 the capacitor stores the logic state 1 or 0 and the transistor provides the rest of the circuitry access to the capacitor to read a dram cell the transistor is turned on and the charge on the capacitor is allowed to flow onto a bitline creating a small voltage which can then be detected
5030411 the fbc is a planar device on soi but the film thicknesses are very different from what is considered conventional soi
5030412 for example the buried oxide thickness is only 10nm compared with gt 100nm for most common soi implementations that means an soi design for a thick bottom oxide box wont work on thin box and vice versa this is one of many integration issues that need to be resolved before we can choose a technology option
5030413 a scaled floating body cell memory with high k metal gate on thin silicon and thin box for 15nm node and beyond
5030414 the devices with 60nm gates show suitable memory retention and at this dimension a bit cell could be less than 0 01 there is also excellent agreement between device and simulation that allows prediction of continued scaling to the 10nm technology node
5030415 this paper demonstrates new adaptive circuit techniques that would allow lowering the minimum operating supply voltage of sram cache cells by making the cells more tolerant to variations in process voltage and temperature
5030416 under certain operating conditions measurements on a 45nm test chip show that number of single cell errors is reduced by as much as 26x these circuits could allow intel to push to better performance and power characteristics without failures on future processes

5030448 it is a hard hitting tv commercial we make no apologies about that because we also know that graphic television advertising really does work the best
5030449 do you really think that no one would perceive there is a bridge over there
5030450 when you treat people like idiots theyll behave like idiots
5030451 i think the dutch are selected for that quality looking for changes by the landscape
5030452 when government takes over the responsibility from citizens the citizens cant develop their own values anymore
5030453 so when you want people to develop their own values in how to cope with social interactions between people you have to give them freedom
5030454 distances are only the relation of space to time and vary with it we express the difficulty that we have in getting to a place in a system of miles or kilometers which becomes false as soon as that difficulty decreases art is modified by it also since a village which seemed to be in a different world from some other village becomes its neighbor in a landscape whose dimensions are altered
5030455 all traveling becomes dull in exact proportion to its rapidity
5030456 as many sights as much landscape and sky as would formerly have been granted to us in a whole lifetime
5030457 they had gone to their uncles spent three days suddenly theyre in a hurry its quite simple they bought a car the first thing put in a car is a clock ticking away in an objective linear time in the past time went different they woke with the chickens and went to bed when it became dark you had your own time schedule depending on what the seasons told you suddenly we can measure the whole day around objective time
5030458 the masters of space and time awaken to find themselves slaves of distance and haste
5030459 you could read the street in the village as a good book
5030460 when you removed all the things that made people know where they were what they were a part of and when you changed it into a uniform world
5030461 i call them copy machines they always do things by the book
5030462 theres a little part of society who dont accept rules who dont accept social structures
5030463 its not up to a traffic engineer to change it
5030464 he used drugs alcohol theres not a street that can cope with that problem
5030465 there are so many things that can be forbidden the stranger thing is that we believe everything that isnt forbidden is allowed
5030466 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5030467 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5030468 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system
5030469 georgia is a sovereign state and the territorial integrity of the state must be provided for
5030470 i wish peace for my country and for our children we do not want to live in fear

5030498 you can make these up to one week in advance
5030499 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
5030500 what is it its the new camaro thats what it is

5030504 theres a report of an elt going off in the panhandle near dalhart texas and we dont know whether thats his or not
5030505 some people say that that could be a logical route for him to take there are a lot of different ways they could have gone
5030506 if something happened to his communication like lightning striking near the plane while they were in flight it could have knocked their communication out and they could have gone further down to the panhandle
5030507 gosh if you saw anything unusual in the sky if you see anything unusual on the ground anything unusual at all that might indicate theres a downed plane please let us know
5030508 everyones heart is broken that we cant contact them that we havent been in contact with them were hoping for the best and terrified about the worst
5030509 many times people are found by interested folks who might know something or might have seen something and if there are any of you out there please let us know
5030510 we ll be hoping to take advantage of their weaknesses of course whilst trying to avoid conceding our first goal of the tournament
5030511 would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union
5030512 people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5030513 we have to invent a new language with regard to russia that is what the european union is trying to do
5030514 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since august 7
5030515 russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia
5030516 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5030517 it appears that on present form the iraqi government probably wont proceed with most of these or all of them
5030518 but i think that some of the companies are open tocontinued discussions even on relationship grounds and some ofthe companies dont think its worth their time
5030519 they are in the right markets with the right products
5030520 you have tolike that and you have to like a company that has executed sowell
5030521 for the past two years crude has followed the dollar almost lock step
5030522 the strength weve seen in the dollar is almost certainly helping bring crude down at this point as you move backward it actually acts as a stimulus on the economy

5030528 hes done it for 14 months so its not something thats a flash in the pan
5030529 hes gone away to have treatment and physical work to get himself ready to play again were hoping he comes back into the one day series feeling refreshed and ready to go
5030530 physically hes in a better shape than he was 12 months ago but he has had a lot of workload and hes bowled a lot of overs in the test matches
5030531 we rested him for the last test and its given him a bit more of a window to get fully recharged hes had a bit of groin pain and neck pain which they are hopeful of getting cleared up so he is available for the next period to come
5030532 i saw him just before we came up here and hes in good spirits hes feeling very fit and strong so hes doing some work down at the performance centre in loughborough with a view to meeting up with us when we get back down there
5030533 hes worked hard over the last 16 months but he picked up three or four niggles all at the same time and then he compensated for that as hes bowled
5030534 you cant take anything lightly because weve got to play south africa on wednesday so everyones fighting for places and everyones fighting to get ready to go
5030535 by the very nature of that it will be a proper game
5030536 to be fair most of our studies have been about south africa because were going to play them in five one day internationals and a twenty20
5030537 but what i know about scotland is that when they played against sussex they were always massively up for the game so you have to be up for the game as well
5030538 were trying to set trends for how we go about our cricket captain kevin pietersen has said he wants everybody up for it every time they play a game for england so that will be no different tomorrow

5030565 upstate new york hasnt had a netroots candidate we have been pretty groundbreaking with what we have been able to do with the campaign the netroots has been a great way to get our message out with folks it has been an alternative approach to the media whether its the campaign side what were going to do with our economic approach or looking into the future of western new york energy policy the netroots represents the future of the new politics 2008 is a once in a generational election that this the netroots has been a critical part of

5030585 is disturbingly full of strange new life in just a few years the gravel and white boulders that for centuries covered the bottom of lake michigan between chicago and the door county wis peninsula have disappeared under a carpet of mussels and primitive plant life
5030586 the lake is changing faster than we can study it
5030587 the ecological balance of the great lakes is at a tipping point
5030588 and the question is can they recover or can we act quickly enough to help them recover
5030589 speed is in our genes researchers at the university of glasgow and the university of the west indies uwi are concluding the glasgow research team has been studying the muscle physiology and genetics of athletes from around the world including some 200 jamaican athletes present and past at the base of sprint speed are the fast twitch muscle fibres stocked with the speed protein actinen a and early data indicate that 70 per cent of jamaican athletes have the gene for actinen a only 30 per cent of australian athletes studied had the gene
5030590 now let me join professor errol morrison in a bit of speculation for which it would be nice if it turned out to be as fruitful not only are jamaicans disproportionately fast on the track we seem to be also disproportionately aggressive and violent now in the world of lower animals aggressive predatory animals are among the fastest with the cheetah at the top among land mammals at 70 miles per hour and the killer whale in the water at 48 mph
5030591 i go back to social psychologist elliot aronsons classic book the social animal now in its 10th edition 2008 for a look at human aggression cause consequence and control aronson asks

5030600 today analog designers have to be comfortable in both analog and digital designs a demanding task that makes them rare highly regarded and well paid
5030601 mixed signal expertise is what we look for when investing in semiconductor makers
5030602 analog circuitry on a digital chip is the secret sauce that can make a proprietary semiconductor uniquely qualified for high volume applications thats where the money is
5030603 in the united states we are producing around 1 000 analog engineers annually from our top universities but 10 or 20 times that many digital engineers are graduating
5030604 there are a lot of ees graduating but fewer and fewer are specializing in analog
5030605 with 23 000 employees in 30 countries we tried to make up our shortfall in the u s by recruiting from other countries so we opened development centers in many areas across the world in order to tap into the analog talent wherever it might be
5030606 we found that eastern europe and asia both had growing markets with analog engineering talent unfortunately we also found that many were without the depth of expertise you need to participate in the global economy we can find really great digital talent everywhere in the world but we are still having a hard time finding experienced analog talent anywhere in the world
5030607 our heritage was to use motorola as our analog supplier but as an independent company we had to start our own programs to attract analog engineers and we have been very fortunate
5030608 we have many talented recruits but we still need more and will hire as many as we can get
5030609 we complement one of our senior managers with several less experienced engineers so that he can mentor them
5030610 this allows the manager to work on more than one design at a time by delegating the tasks that are time consuming but require less experience
5030611 a digital engineer can often start making significant contributions to a company just six months after graduating
5030612 but analog technology requires five to seven years of on the job experience before engineers can begin making significant contributions
5030613 digital has become so popular that people often assume analog is the old technology
5030614 i say the best thing that ever occurred to analog was the digital revolution the digital gadgets have to interface with the real world which is analog to create those interfaces you need analog engineers
5030615 those that know it best having been disappointed the most like it the least
5030616 i am so happy i believed in myself and i worked hard i believe i won because i have experience and i took my time with my preparation

5030628 i was sitting down having a cigarette and he spotted me and made a beeline to me
5030629 he got all of his security to close in so johnny couldnt get to me
5030630 so we were encircled and hes like how are you doing little lady
5030631 and i said happy birthday frank and he just lunged for me
5030632 he kissed me on the lips then gave me a filterless cigarette i came off all lightheaded he was fabulous
5030633 hey its time to rub my hips and feel sorry for me
5030634 if we can get those opened up itll greatly diminish the amount of water up there
5030635 as a regular church goer comfortable talking about his faith mr obama is ostensibly better placed than most recent democratic candidates to win over evangelicals
5030636 whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5030637 if he cant answer because it is above his pay grade then why should we put him in the top job it will remain above his pay grade when he returns to the senate also he said he would not have nominated clarence thomas to the supreme court because he lacked experience and was not qualified sounds familiar
5030638 obama has shown himself to be unworthy of the office of president with his making a joke out of the question put to him
5030639 after listening to that forum im not sure obama knows what he believed we weaved and wandered all around those questions mccain was direct and succinct in his answers you might not agree with him but at least you know where he stands obama remains an enigma
5030640 above my pay grade is it supposed to be funny that a democrat cant take a single stance on anything this politician is pathetic posted by patrick august 16th 2008
5030641 above his pay grade what a shmoe what blatant disrespect the guy has no class
5030642 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
5030643 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5030644 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it
5030645 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
5030646 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states

5030661 unfortunately its getting pretty crowded up here and we find that we now have to give people an entrance examination before we let them in
5030662 yes forest i know but this test is only three questions here they are
5030663 the first one is easy which two days of the week begin with the letter t today and tomorrow
5030664 well that wasnt the answer i was looking for but you have a point i give you credit for that answer
5030665 i see what you mean ill have to give you credit for that one too
5030666 i learned it in church we used to sing about it
5030667 andy walks with me andy talks with me andy tells me i am his own
5030668 still to this day i think people are in shock over it and a lot of people are still in denial
5030669 you know 25 years ago we lived in a cheap apartment drove a cheap car had only a sofa bed and watched a 14
5030670 we have a nice house a new car a big flat screen tv but i have to sleep with a 50 year old woman it doesnt seem fair
5030671 well why dont you go out and get yourself a hot 25 year old blonde then ill make sure you will once again live in a cheap apartment drive a cheap car have only a sofa bed and watch a 14
5030672 weve been so close before it feels good to put a ford here in victory lane
5030673 we always enjoy racing here in front of the home crowd
5030674 its a race track that suits our cars and our driving style
5030675 its not like i wont ever get to see those guys the no 20 crew again but i know its the last time im going to drive that car for those guys
5030676 when youre that successful you hate to see it end
5030677 on old tires when handling was more important we could run the top of the track and keep our engine wound up
5030678 i felt like we had something for em but unfortunately we just ran out of time
5030679 i think we had a better car than edwards did
5030680 but with the new toyota restrictor plate nascar put on us he definitely had us beat on power theres not a lot we can do about that
5030681 well it kept them from having a giant advantage the whole day like theyve had for the first half of the year

5030685 these nris earn much more than what an average indian get and this is also one reasons for them to make property investments in india

5030691 i could put girls in there and be within the law
5030692 but i enjoy at this stage of my life to be part owner of a comedy club
5030693 to keep them occupied and give them an outlet for privacy theyve been given these virtual reality modules
5030694 they each have a little corner to call their own and it can be anything they want it to be a place they can be alone they can do some sort of activity or be in some time period its whatever they want
5030695 i am a firm believer that the octopus gigantus for real is a true species

5030697 it fell when my car hit the lamppost and people got hit
5030698 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5030699 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5030700 that fraud has increased and appraisal fraud has increased in a way to exacerbate the problems
5030701 the higher the loan amount the more money brokers and lenders make in the deal
5030702 and they threaten you they say if you dont play ball with us well go somewhere else and they do ive seen my business shrink theyre all doing it its hard to stay honest
5030703 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis
5030704 we got to this point by a lack of enforcement the public has the right to expect the appraisal boards are taking care of that problem
5030705 do you know what that would have meant the net effect is it would have effectively shut down mortgage lending in that state
5030706 to take that action would have been an unbelievable disruption to the economy i wasnt going to do that
5030707 either you shut it off completely in a state or you just send letters
5030708 the threat of the atomic bomb is the only thing
5030709 they know they can keep doing what theyre doing because they can get away with it
5030710 theyre not getting punished and states arent doing more because they know regulators wont do a thing
5030711 i wasnt alone we had appraisers from all over the nation writing in and urging them to take action
5030712 resulting from inappropriate pressure being placed on real estate property appraisers to hit a certain value
5030713 people who say we should have done more dont understand how the system works
5030714 agencies just dont lobby to change things we had no interest in doing anything like that it just wasnt our area
5030715 good position to work with bank regulators and others on the problem
5030716 everything related to the issue went into a black hole why i just dont know
5030717 i tried to push but nobody wanted to hear what i was saying
5030718 problem appraisals are being allowed and in some ways even encouraged by a regulatory structure that promotes lax enforcement and ineffective oversight
5030719 we are here to alert congress that the licensing system it created for appraisers is broken and needs to be fixed
5030720 but states dont have the money to hire personnel to carry out what the system was designed to do
5030721 may have been rude or said my house wasnt worth as much as i thought
5030722 just because youre disciplined that doesnt make you a bad appraiser
5030723 i may have done some technical things wrong but ive done a good job im proud of my work
5030724 why should he get super zapped for doing a lot of little things that a lot of other appraisers are doing every day but havent had complaints turned in on them
5030725 there has to be effective enforcement of some sort there has to be reality to it
5030726 what are you going to do if there is pressure on appraisers how are you going to penalize someone who puts that pressure on appraisers whos going to do it whos going to enforce it they need to have that or it wont work
5030727 demonstrate the power of our brands in generating awareness and generating traffic for our advertisers and put a smile on peoples faces
5030728 thats interesting do you help companies figure out how much they should pay people to talk about their product
5030729 were extremely satisfied with and proud of our news gathering operation
5030730 if edwards were to fold after iowa most of his voters would probably migrate to mr obama
5030731 when likely republican voters were asked if freedom requires religion as romney claimed in his speech on faith in america last week 55 percent said no while 34 per cent said yes
5030732 and 53 percent said there should be complete separation of church and state while 35 percent said no
5030733 the story is not the story the story is the drive by media turning on its favorite maverick and trying to take him out the media picked the gops candidate the new york times endorsed him while they sat on this story and is now with utter predictability trying to destroy him
5030734 patently politically motivated hit job a 10 year old piece of gossip
5030735 the new york times is not in the news business theyre political activists posing as news people
5030736 a question about american muslims and the civil rights movement
5030737 if the democrats make this about as they seem to be inclined to do im not bush and ill do everything different than bush did the american people understand that bush is not on the ballot
5030738 i think its one of the reasons why hillary clinton is not doing well against named republicans candidates because all she can talk about is how shes not bush
5030739 shell get hammered by posturing democrats like chuck schumer and ted kennedy thats my bet
5030740 i think these capital structures have gone so out of sync with the country
5030741 these pollings illustrate that i look at these polls and see this campaign as someone begging to pick it up
5030742 i was driven to american solutions by looking at albany sacramento trenton and by looking at washington
5030743 if youre truly serious about changing the country you cant just be talking about just the oval office or the white house like its the center of the universe its an important piece of a much bigger story
5030744 mexican americans have never fit in with the american racial system and will erode it and undermine it
5030745 mongrels bastards orphans and vagabonds mexican immigration and the future of race in america
5030746 i wrote a book and essentially its history hidden in argument
5030747 integration matters we cant just talk about immigration all the time now might be a good time to share to circle around with your ethnicities and be american
5030748 individual freedom of decision is not abolished but restricted by the collective effects of complex systems in nature and society which cannot be forecast or controlled in the long run
5030749 get your keys we need to go to the emergency room thats gotta get stitched up
5030750 as a muslim i can personally attest that islamophobia is not a myth
5030751 a lot of people have misconceptions that they think are fact
5030752 look at all the people that have been displaced all the lost oil production unemployment all those type of things
5030753 look at all the people that have been displaced all the lost oil production unemployment all those type of things
5030754 its such a bitter environment in washington right now that its going to be tough for the president to get much accomplished beyond that
5030755 clinton is our president and we must not say anything against him that could undermine our troops
5030756 look at all the people that have been displaced all the lost oil production unemployment all those type of things

5030812 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5030813 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open
5030814 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5030815 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet

5030840 the smaller plane disintegrated immediately and the right engine of the twin aircraft blew up
5030841 how they collided and how they came to the collision we still do not know
5030842 they are known to us all theyve been around for some time most of us have been around for some time
5030843 the twin engined aircraft was on quite a low approach to coventry on the normal land path when a smaller aircraft came from the right and the twin engined aircraft struck it side on the smaller plane disintegrated immediately and the right engine of the twin aircraft blew up
5030844 whilst we watched the twin engined aircraft bank steeply to the left with smoke coming from its right engine it seemed to level off and climb slightly before dropping steeply down to the left
5030845 on arrival at the scene they found both aircraft had crashed one had gone down in brandon woods
5030846 unfortunately there were four people confirmed dead in the wreckage of that aircraft
5030847 the second aircraft landed in a field near coventry road between brinklow and coventry and sadly one person was confirmed dead at that aircraft crash site
5030848 sadly there was nothing that could be done other than the grim task of confirming the deaths of the five people
5030849 if we were asked for more training teams that would be really hard for us to do were just about capped out at what were providing now
5030850 we have these pity parties in kabul about how much the afghan soldiers need no they need good leadership

5030852 hes asking his military people to provide those kinds of services and knowledge base for things they his troops may not be very expert in
5030853 we are providing the security for this road then the contractors will come and they can start their work
5030854 such ambitious plans as long as they are complemented by sustained resources and a realistic assessment of timelines are not a bad thing
5030855 the real problem comes if ambitious rhetoric is unmatched by funding or long term commitment since that raises local expectations and leaves them frustrated

5030860 the faithful have the right to approach suspended priests for the sacraments

5030862 there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future

5030867 americas greatest moral failing was not devoting itself to causes greater than its self interest after the 9 11 terrorist attacks americans should not have been told go to shopping
5030868 it means i believe that jesus christ died for my sins and that i am redeemed through him that is a source of strength and sustenance on a daily basis i know that i dont walk alone but what it also means i think is a sense of obligation to embrace not just words but also through deeds and expectations that god has for us and that means thinking about the least of these acting justly loving mercy and walking humbly with our god

5030883 at the michael j fox foundation we believe that our capital has an obligation to fund high risk high reward projects that if successful could significantly improve the lives of people with parkinsons
5030884 a major element of our work is the identification and prioritization of approaches like armagens efforts that without our backing would likely stall for lack of resources
5030885 trojan horse technology has intrigued parkinsons researchers for years because of its theoretical potential to overcome the drug delivery hurdle one of the single most significant challenges facing the entire field
5030886 it is fitting that the michael j fox foundation which is searching urgently for treatments that will significantly modify parkinsons disease should provide funding to vet the potential of this technology to yield new therapies that could transform patients lives
5030887 for the past two years leroy shared his life with cancer on the air and online with passion wit and a kind brutal honesty that created a safe space for an open and candid dialogue about the disease

5030914 i think people do want to see films but it is tough
5030915 one time in this town in one day pirates of the caribbean was played 52 times a small independent movie played up against that doesnt have a chance

5030950 you can be more colloquial in how you choose your words and your voice but the speed to market and the power of this new medium is such that we might not be doing enough yoga breathing or taking enough care with what were putting up
5030951 this is comparable to hanging out with gutenberg inventor of movable type printing in the 14th century
5030952 one in 10 comments probably has some insight i would regard as added value
5030953 given that i have to invest about 60 seconds to scan 10 comments to get that insight thats a good return on my investment
5030954 its the most fun writing that i do because i can write about anything that interests me at the moment

5030959 gates has earned our ear and for many of us our respect largely because he succeeded so convincingly playing the game of market capitalism given gates achievements it is interesting that he is throwing down a gauntlet to have global capitalism direct itself toward social contribution as well as financial gain it is also important

5030971 when i think about food there is always a fantastical backdrop the stage is littered with metaphor and simile and sometimes reckless exaggeration trips the actors up although they dont mind
5030972 when i write this all down and have it sorted into a recipe the fanfare suddenly quiets i have successfully captured all the essentials to be able to repeat the experience but none of the tra la la is left for the recipes name
5030973 which is why it reads like a list of ingredients instead of something more exciting
5030974 people were pretty much the same back then as they are now and i would not be surprised if it was so that they would have privacy people like to gossip
5030975 what would have to be true in order for the various fragments in information that i have gathered to be true

5030979 we all know and speak highly of mahatma gandhi but very few people will ever give recognition to the fact that without the support of the indian community in south africa the name mahatma gandhi would not even have been a footnote in history
5030980 gandhis experiments in satyagraha his experiments in harnessing non violence as a power of truth and bearing witness against oppression proved successful because the mahatmas call received a response from the indian community of this country
5030981 so satyagraha is the singular contribution that south africans of indian descent have made to the history of not only south africa and india but many other parts of the world
5030982 there is a tendency especially today to relegate the role of various communities and individuals to the background that is very wrong it is an injustice and i think it is a misrepresentation of the truth
5030983 that was a lesson that has gone throughout the world and has informed every struggle in the 20th century in honouring gandhiji we must also honour and recognise the singular contribution made by this community to the struggle for liberation here and in every other part of the world
5030984 this is a very rare pregnancy something i have never witnessed over my past 33 years in this profession

5031015 marks amp spencer has angered those customers with a lot of cleavage by starting to charge extra for bigger sized bras but members of a new group on the social networking site facebook called busts 4 justice have stopped buying full priced bras from the store in protest its founder beckie williams a 25 year old childrens writer from brighton said it is like having a tax on bigger breasts i hover on the brink of where the bras get more expensive so i noticed the difference in price i started trying to cram myself into the smaller sizes and realised that it was ridiculous
5031016 i dont see them charging extra material for the inch thick wedge of foam that pads the aa cups so why should i pay more for the extra lace on my plus size bra
5031017 i was going to put my money where my mouth is and offer myself as a guinea pig to the department taking their infamous treadmill test whereby women run on a treadmill and high tech cameras linked to computers measure the distance that their breasts move as they run a treadmill stands before a backdrop of a black curtain five cameras pointing at it this high tech bounce o meter is where 50 other women have run before me and where im about to go for the most unusual and possibly humiliating jog of my life
5031018 i already wish id never come here but the knowledge that 50 other women many with boobs bigger than mine 32g since you ask have already taken up this challenge spurs me on i strip to the waist and clamber onto the treadmill the only shock absorber im now wearing is the gel in my trainers

5031021 the reasoning was that those who were offended could turn away
5031022 but that doesnt prevent the state from criminalizing a verbal assault of repeated loud profanities in a public place that disrupts the rights of others

5031061 the bush administration wants to require all recipients of aid under federal health programs to certify that they will not refuse to hire nurses and other providers who object to abortion and even certain types of birth control

5031080 yes god is a compassionate being but hes also a just moral and pure being
5031081 he had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him he was despised and rejected by men a man of sorrows and familiar with suffering surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows he was pierced for our transgression he was crushed for our iniquities the punishment that brought us peace was upon him and by his wounds we are healed

5031150 ich habe einen anderen fahrer ber hrt und bin entt uscht dass ich deshalb einige positionen verloren habe gleichzeitig bin ich aber mit dem ergebnis zufrieden
5031151 wir m ssen uns wirklich drastisch verbessern was die reifen angeht ich hatte vorne absolut keinen grip und hinten auch nicht von der ersten runde bis zur letzten hat sich die situation nicht im geringsten ver ndert
5031152 ich w re zweimal fast gest rzt also habe ich einfach versucht das rennen zu beenden ich habe unter schwierigsten bedingungen mein bestes gegeben am ende war die situation mit den reifen noch schlimmer als ohnehin das ganze rennen ber
5031153 es ist sehr schwer f r mich einen kommentar zum rennen heute abzugeben ich kann nur sagen dass ich von diesem wochenende sehr entt uscht bin
5031154 es war ein desaster f r uns das team hat sein bestes gegeben wurde aber von der reifen performance eingeschr nkt

5031179 they hit a lot of 3s and love to drive and kickout for the open shot
5031180 i just happen to be in the right place at the right time
5031181 i actually thought that i missed a lot of shots early that i usually hit
5031182 i think most of us grew up watching these girls i think i was 10 years old when lisa leslie played in her first olympics it was a good experience i think we played pretty well all things considered
5031183 were trained to keep order on an airplane and defuse confrontation
5031184 if it takes giving a free beverage to somebody to do that so be it i expect there will be flight attendants who just give everything away
5031185 this is one tactic weve just had to put in place to cope with fuel prices

5031203 intentar ganar medallas en los juegos es la natural responsabilidad de atletas y entrenadores pero nunca nos hemos propuesto como meta ser los primeros en medallas de oro
5031204 es verdad que china obtuvo el segundo puesto en medallas de oro en atenas pero tenemos que mirar las cosas como son y el hecho es que estamos muy por detr s de las grandes potencias deportivas del mundo
5031205 en los deportes de pelota salvo el voleibol femenino seguimos muy por detr s
5031206 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
5031207 when i was thinking about it i was getting ahead of myself
5031208 weve been waiting on this so many great athletes have come so close
5031209 it was a flagrant and a blatant false start that was not recalled and had tremendous impact on the race
5031210 but theyre not going to rerun the olympic 100 anyone who knows anything knows that
5031211 one of my favorite people of all time is ms ellen degeneres
5031212 so i wish all the best all the happiness all the joy that comes with that certificate just the joy of being able to stand up and say that in front of everyone you love and care about in front of each other and to walk away legal is huge
5031213 i love ellen degeneres i watch her show all the time
5031214 i just want to say congratulations and i am really sorry you didnt invite me to your wedding
5031215 obama is not your typical washington insider hes not from central casting when it comes to candidates for president of the united states hes new to washington yes hes african american half black kenyan a muslim who is also half hawaiian christian white boy
5031216 half black kenyan a muslim who is also half hawaiian christian white boy
5031217 didnt look like those other presidents on those dollar bills
5031218 hes not from central casting when it comes to candidates for president of the united states hes new to washington yes hes african american half black kenyan muslim and half hawaiian christian white boy
5031219 we have learnt from western tv how to simplify the narrative
5031220 hes done it for 14 months so its not something thats a flash in the pan
5031221 hes gone away to have treatment and physical work to get himself ready to play again were hoping he comes back into the one day series feeling refreshed and ready to go
5031222 physically hes in a better shape than he was 12 months ago but he has had a lot of workload and hes bowled a lot of overs in the test matches
5031223 we rested him for the last test and its given him a bit more of a window to get fully recharged hes had a bit of groin pain and neck pain which they are hopeful of getting cleared up so he is available for the next period to come
5031224 i saw him just before we came up here and hes in good spirits hes feeling very fit and strong so hes doing some work down at the performance centre in loughborough with a view to meeting up with us when we get back down there
5031225 hes worked hard over the last 16 months but he picked up three or four niggles all at the same time and then he compensated for that as hes bowled
5031226 you cant take anything lightly because weve got to play south africa on wednesday so everyones fighting for places and everyones fighting to get ready to go
5031227 by the very nature of that it will be a proper game
5031228 to be fair most of our studies have been about south africa because were going to play them in five one day internationals and a twenty20
5031229 but what i know about scotland is that when they played against sussex they were always massively up for the game so you have to be up for the game as well
5031230 were trying to set trends for how we go about our cricket captain kevin pietersen has said he wants everybody up for it every time they play a game for england so that will be no different tomorrow
5031231 it was really hard to go back into the gym after what happened but i kept training

5031250 driving the r8 is like smearing honey into keira knightly
5031251 in principle this car is too fast for my thoughts
5031252 as much as interstate wins are difficult you only get four points so what it means is we stay in the eight and weve got destiny in our own control thats what it means
5031253 whats momentum im not being smart but everyone talks about momentum and gee whiz weve won one we just get some confidence back that we are a reasonable team
5031254 well i tell you what you cant win finals and play in them until youre in them and we are clearly not in them so that questions irrelevant
5031255 everyone led but in particular at the pointy end riewoldt and lenny hayes were outstanding he riewoldt is our captain he plays with presence the bottom line is you need your leaders playing well and he did that today
5031256 he didnt want to have a farewell game himself hes one of those guys that doesnt like the attention of playing the last game
5031257 were 100 percent sure it was dumped back on our doorstep
5031258 where it was found was not somewhere it could have gone by itself
5031259 i think we are making progress the coaches put us in some tough situations in the red zone we made some plays but we just have to be more consistent
5031260 the coaches always tell us that competition brings the best out of you i come out here everyday knowing that i have to continuously prove myself because with the receiving corps we have out here now a day or two of not proving yourself you are liable to be at the bottom of the depth chart
5031261 we cant achieve our goals with a performance we had on defense today we talked about being discipline and we werent very discipline we talked about doing your job and we didnt do it we had too many busts out there where a guy simply did not do his job we werent tough enough and we didnt cause many fumbles i dont recall seeing a hard lick
5031262 fumble exchanges killed us a couple times fourth and one and a third and one tough in the red zone thats where weve got to get better were working a lot on it but we hope to get better
5031263 well keep working on it then there are some things offense didnt run down there that i thought would have been real good against goal line defense but then they wanted to look at something else

5031267 we cannot underestimate the importance of understanding the social psychological and experiential differences that may increase the likelihood of psychological disorders among this fast growing segment of the population
5031268 i want to give jorge every opportunity to show us this is something he can handle
5031269 there is a more dynamic arm thats not to take away anything from glendons efficiency but right now i think we need to make sure we are creative and proactive looking at this we need to give jorge every opportunity to show us what hes got

5031277 we were ready for it and that to be honest is a real credit to the coaching staff
5031278 the assistant coaches who put so much work into that area of the game probably real credit to the guys who go and do the opposition analysis they did their homework we then put a couple of strategies in place to break that down and then youve got the players who stuck to the strategies that we put in place
5031279 we went from being as undisciplined structurally last week to as disciplined structurally as what ive seen since ive been here it shows what you can do in a week in footy
5031280 i think the people in the industry sometimes look at a fortnight in footy and dont look at the bigger picture at times i think weve shown as much natural improvement over the course of the season as have most of the other sides that are lower down the ladder
5031281 the key to our game was that it was more of a four quarter performance weve won games this year where weve had eight or nine goals in a quarter and had a terrific patch and then gone missing for a patch in the game it was probably our best four quarter disciplined do the right thing nothing fancy get the job done game that weve played
5031282 there were times when williams and roughead were on and they were kicked to and they were cut off just because the execution of the kick was poor other times in the last quarter mark williams is on for a lead and he tries to take a chest mark rather than out in his hands and it gets punched away there are plenty of opportunities for all of our forwards to have an impact on the game
5031283 we worked extremely hard on that through the acl and tonight didnt concede again so its a positive sign but if you look at the whole round this weekend there werent too many goals scored
5031284 so certainly every team is better structured and if you dont see too many goals this year its not for the lack of effort in front of goals itll be more for the way teams are better structured
5031285 in the a league theres not much between the teams you saw adelaide tonight are a very good side and we gave as good as we got
5031286 they created chances towards the end simply because we were pushing forward the other three games were draws todays game could easily have been a draw as well so its important we go home and try to win next week
5031287 i had a quick look across and thought you beauty here we go we are going to have a really good crack at this i dont know what happened you put your heart and soul into your performance
5031288 we were just paddling towards the line i had a quick look at the screen to watch the finish and see who won the thing
5031289 it was 99 per cent certain he wasnt going to make it
5031290 for years ive had a bit of a dodgy back
5031291 all the travel out to the course when you arrive here after a 10 hour flight and with all the sitting down at the induction my sacrum was starting to lock up
5031292 the night before the final we were down there with the physio and the doctor and the coach
5031293 i sat down on the rowing machine and had a couple of strokes from that point on it was right we are going to take it really cautiously and not row before the race and doing our land based training
5031294 it was a matter if we were going to jump on the water for the race for the semi and see how it is
5031295 medically if youve got a pinched nerve you can get damage in your leg with it not operating very well
5031296 the fortunate thing for me is that we got it early enough
5031297 by not getting into the boat between the semi final and the final meant i wasnt aggravating it it was a matter of just putting up with the pain
5031298 we had come this far that we werent going to let a little bit of back discomfort get in my way
5031299 with all the emotion i didnt give much thought to it for the first couple of strokes
5031300 once you get the boat up to speed the biggest thing is to just move in time
5031301 at 300 metres to go i just started thinking about it again
5031302 the race had been rowed to the best of our abilities and it was a matter of just hanging on
5031303 i dont know if any conversations were had with him fosterling as to where hes got to stand on the bank
5031304 i had been through the experience in 2000 in the world cup heats
5031305 we called the reserve in i jumped out of the boat just the heats
5031306 usain bolt went out there and gave a performance that was unbelievable 9 69 easing down at about 90 metres spectacular
5031307 people thought you had to be short strong and stocky to be a great sprinter
5031308 usain bolt has re defined that and shown that a 6ft5in sprinter is able to run really well it is the beginning of something else
5031309 i felt myself pulling away from the rest of the field but i could see usain slowing down while i am still pumping to the line he is a phenomenal athlete
5031310 its not necessarily his stride length but that the frequency of his stride is very constant seemingly where some of the other athletes are slowing down he is picking up
5031311 i am not worried about world records there is a lot more time to think about that and right now my main aim is just to win
5031312 i like dancing i have been doing that all season it keeps me relaxed and when i go in the blocks i refocus for the race
5031313 he didnt stop running but you couldnt put the loads on him that you would put on a normal athlete we left him alone basically
5031314 i say come down and see our program come down and see our testing come down and see how we operate we have nothing to hide come any time day or night
5031315 to swim in the same era as him has been awesome
5031316 i want to be my own clock not have to be anywhere at any time and just hang
5031317 id probably be in the real world having a job
5031318 hes about as big as you get back home now but that doesnt mean swimming is
5031319 then im really looking forward to going home to baltimore and lying in my own bed im also really excited to catch up with my friends from high school
5031320 my sport has come a long way and it can go further and i want to push that

5031324 i didnt have my music on and my windows were rolled up
5031325 plus it was cold and i had my leather jacket on
5031326 they slammed me down on the ground put pistols and tasers to my back
5031327 i didnt know what they were here for they said it was for assaulting a peace officer
5031328 whenever he told me to watch my mouth i looked at him like he was crazy like he didnt look like an actual police officer to me

5031364 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5031365 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5031366 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5031367 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5031371 this year we have a few fires but theyre all under 2 000 3 000 acres and so with fewer fires we have a lot more resources available to spread out over those
5031372 so we have a lot more hand crews on the ground and aerial resources available
5031373 there havent been a lot of big fires this is really the only big fire in idaho to date
5031374 we still get a lot of human ignitions throughout the area
5031375 but the storms and the fronts that weve been having coming trough havent had as much dry lightning like we have had in some years and thats certainly a factor
5031376 we dont know what the rest of the season is going to hold
5031377 this might end with a season ending event in two or three weeks and we also might have six to eight weeks of fire season its just really is at the mercy of the weather

5031412 i once heard the suggestion that you develop your life purpose statement based on what you would like other people to say about you at your funeral imagine your perfect eulogy then build your statement on that frankly thats a bad plan at the end of your life it isnt going to matter at all what other people say about you the only thing that will matter is what god says about you
5031413 now that you understand the purpose of life it is your responsibility to carry the message to others

5031435 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5031436 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5031437 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5031438 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5031439 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5031440 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5031441 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5031442 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5031443 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5031444 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5031445 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5031446 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5031447 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5031448 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5031449 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5031450 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5031451 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5031452 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5031453 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5031454 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5031455 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

5031467 a medal of any color is our goal of course preferably gold but im color blind
5031468 whatever happens im sure our athletes will make every filipino proud remember donnie geisler in athens he broke his leg during a match and still begged to continue even though donnie came home without a medal he won the admiration of not only the filipino people but every one who saw his display of courage you can be a hero without a medal
5031469 but we dont expect any fighter to be short changed were anticipating better officiating in beijing than athens because the rounds will now be a minute shorter the action will be fierce right from the start no one will waste any time in trying to score points
5031470 if you qualify from the world championships you re one of the best
5031471 of course a good draw for us is when those with a good kick are in a different group while toni gets to the other half of the draw so she meets them only in the finals
5031472 on our part whatever the draw we are back to the situation where you have to fight everybody thats the only way you prove to yourself that you can be an olympic champion
5031473 i brought two bags from home but there was a third that i left behind in this new country apart from the struggles that made me a stranger were your needs of the ones who bid me goodbye those i left behind among the papers i collected you had put a small bag of sweets i left behind there were divisions at home there were other possibilities there were communities in my town there were communities where i came i found a job called it a struggle for survival everything else i left behind i didnt want to forget my traditions the tradition of forgetting i left behind bags passport my shoes crossed the yellow lines something was left behind here i am a sum of different parts travel agents everywhere are selling ads for the parts that were left behind

5031524 ellen degeneres and portia de rossi were married tonight in an intimate ceremony at their home in los angeles
5031525 shes taught me lessons about myself and i feel like ive taught her
5031526 weve both changed and grown and we just feel like oh okay this is completion
5031527 these stalkers have rigid personalities and maladaptive styles these disorders in themselves are very stable and not treatable
5031528 i had a lot of sleepless nights because i was nervous but this allowed me to concentrate more and train harder
5031529 the teams been building for this for a year a hundred people really working in one direction
5031530 the course was very technical and you had to be careful sapphire didnt touch a fence
5031531 it was even more nerve wracking having to go clear
5031532 i was proud of what i was able to achieve today
5031533 im ending my career doing my personal best at the olympic games and you couldnt ask for much more than that
5031534 i like what i feel when im on the springboard and i just cant possibly give it up
5031535 i was more emotional than ive been in the past but thats understandable
5031536 this last year has been incredibly difficult for me i really worked really hard the entire year
5031537 i started the competition feeling very tight and on the second dive i said youve got to do something to change this and i did i was very proud i was able to acknowledge how i felt and make a change during the competition
5031538 if all of our dives go in and compete like blythe just competed im going to walk away as proud as i can be
5031539 ive seen her in almost every single major and this was her single best event
5031540 the other girls beat her fair and square this sport this type of event is very much like golf in that its about people missing and they didnt miss a great deal
5031541 were going to see sort of a build towards 2012 and i think well be in contention then too
5031542 i do think there is a lot of opportunity on springboard
5031543 we can move to a greater degree of difficulty and move into tougher twisting dives
5031544 shes been a class act the larry robinson of diving if you know what i mean
5031545 she has shown leadership has been always courteous and respectful and all the things you hope to see in an athlete and shes had her struggles too
5031546 im surprised its a little bit late for a trade
5031547 but for me i passed my best times in this organization
5031548 sometimes guys just have off years i think that happens its a part of the game hes certainly healthy and i think a change of scenery will help him
5031549 i think going to a pennant race will help him
5031550 i cant say enough good things about luis he took the ball for us anytime he was asked and did a phenomenal job his entire career hell be missed
5031551 theyre fighting for first place so im going to do my best to clear my mind and try to help the bullpen
5031552 he attacked the hitters i kind of expect the same thing plus hes experienced thats important
5031553 he had requested to be traded this year throughout the year
5031554 we attempted to do so by the trade deadline and just were not able to make a deal that made sense for us with a month and a half left before free agency we felt we needed to get something for him
5031555 to insure fairness sen mccain will not hear the questions of the first hour

5031559 my fathers a farmer and we have a lot of egg laying hens one time we were taking our eggs to market in a basket on the front seat of the pickup when we hit a bump in the road and all the eggs went flying and broke and made a mess
5031560 our family are farmers too but we raise chickens for the meat market we had a dozen eggs one time but when they hatched we only got ten live chicks and the moral to this story is dont count your chickens until they hatch
5031561 yes maam my daddy told me this story about my grandpa who was a fighter pilot in world war two and his plane got hit
5031562 what kind of moral did your daddy tell you from that horrible story
5031563 introducing practical measures to boost morale at this difficult time was vital
5031564 will lose the next election if it does not take tough tax decisions to bail out core voters
5031565 our duty is to act decisively and make tax and spending decisions that show we understand what it is like to cope with rising food fuel and utility bills
5031566 if as a result of the current economic situation the only way to help hard pressed middle class families is to ask the higher earners to pay more then serious consideration should be given to that
5031567 she got caught up in the ropes which lifted her up off the ground and then deposited her back on the ground very quickly
5031568 the bell towers about 30m up inside the church and the only access is a narrow spiral staircase there was no way we could have brought her down that in her condition so we considered loading a platform from the outside or dropping her down the bell tower on the inside

5031570 americans cant afford to wait until the middle of september for congress to address the energy crisis
5031571 with gasoline over 4 00 a gallon many western new yorkers are cancelling their summer vacations we need congress to make the same sacrifice
5031572 not a lot of people know that dan is a chautauqua county businessman
5031573 he owns two stores here he has chosen to invest in this community by employing staff and paying property taxes moreover i really appreciate his call for congress to end their recess and go back to work and take action on achieving a comprehensive energy plan

5031612 as more and more information is collected and kept on all of us we are very concerned that appropriate safeguards go along with that
5031613 people should know what is happening with their information and have a choice
5031614 our concern is that what is kept with the justification of preventing and detecting terrorism can then be used for minor purposes such as pursuing people for parking fines
5031615 companies such as google and internet service providers are building up huge databases of data about internet users
5031616 these companies may be compelled through a legal action to hand over this information to third parties or the government or the companies may lose the data and it can then be misused
5031617 i got a lot of ralph lauren clothing from the 80s and 90s that you wouldnt be able to find anywhere else and for a better price than any clothing elsewhere
5031618 this is what we play for we play each game to get better and we wanted to be seeded no 1 in our pool and go from there the competition is going to get a lot stronger from this point forward and now its one and done
5031619 its about what we do on that day against south korea
5031620 we wont be intimidated and we will try and put on a good performance
5031621 we are much shorter and we must focus on our defense against them
5031622 we will appeal this decision but our appeal will have no meaning the sudanese judge is not independent
5031623 a new china day was born its not just a daily record high but chinas total of golds surpasses sydney and athens a magnificent china day
5031624 im extremely happy and proud today because we have made a breakthrough in the rowing history of china
5031625 the chinese delegation must remain clear headed because according to the competition schedule most of the teams events are in the first half
5031626 this is the main reason that china has been leading the gold medal count
5031627 for a long time people kind of got use to going to the doctors and filing a claim now its like we want the whole bill upfront
5031628 we are like any other business we have to collect our money to pay our bills its far easier to collect upfront than to go after someone on the back end
5031629 its reasonable to go an eye doctor on monday and then visit other doctors on wednesday and thursday and there will be an overpayment

5031640 that mans written more books than ive read see he doesnt even have time to sit down for lunch
5031641 hes done it for 14 months so its not something thats a flash in the pan
5031642 hes gone away to have treatment and physical work to get himself ready to play again were hoping he comes back into the one day series feeling refreshed and ready to go
5031643 physically hes in a better shape than he was 12 months ago but he has had a lot of workload and hes bowled a lot of overs in the test matches
5031644 we rested him for the last test and its given him a bit more of a window to get fully recharged hes had a bit of groin pain and neck pain which they are hopeful of getting cleared up so he is available for the next period to come
5031645 i saw him just before we came up here and hes in good spirits hes feeling very fit and strong so hes doing some work down at the performance centre in loughborough with a view to meeting up with us when we get back down there
5031646 hes worked hard over the last 16 months but he picked up three or four niggles all at the same time and then he compensated for that as hes bowled
5031647 you cant take anything lightly because weve got to play south africa on wednesday so everyones fighting for places and everyones fighting to get ready to go
5031648 by the very nature of that it will be a proper game
5031649 to be fair most of our studies have been about south africa because were going to play them in five one day internationals and a twenty20
5031650 but what i know about scotland is that when they played against sussex they were always massively up for the game so you have to be up for the game as well
5031651 were trying to set trends for how we go about our cricket captain kevin pietersen has said he wants everybody up for it every time they play a game for england so that will be no different tomorrow
5031652 i know its terrible lets not talk about it now shall we walk down to the beach theres no one there now

5031668 i dont see them charging extra material for the inch thick wedge of foam that pads the aa cups so why should i pay more for the extra lace on my plus size bra
5031669 i was going to put my money where my mouth is and offer myself as a guinea pig to the department taking their infamous treadmill test whereby women run on a treadmill and high tech cameras linked to computers measure the distance that their breasts move as they run a treadmill stands before a backdrop of a black curtain five cameras pointing at it this high tech bounce o meter is where 50 other women have run before me and where im about to go for the most unusual and possibly humiliating jog of my life
5031670 i already wish id never come here but the knowledge that 50 other women many with boobs bigger than mine 32g since you ask have already taken up this challenge spurs me on i strip to the waist and clamber onto the treadmill the only shock absorber im now wearing is the gel in my trainers

5031672 the depth of the pools of liquidity is so much larger than it used to be that a disruptive event now needs to be much more disruptive than it used to be at some point the disruptive event will be so significant that instead of liquidity filling in the liquidity will go the other way i dont think were at that point

5031679 tal vez elijo el momento m s oportuno para marcar goles importantes
5031680 me alegr mucho por el gol me pusieron un buen bal n y quer a marcar por encima de todo el 2 0 nos dio la seguridad fue el remate de la confianza

5031685 graziano asserted that apart from un troops lebanese soldiers and hunters no one was armed south of the litani river
5031686 1701 also calls for the implementation of security council resolution 1559 especially the disarmament of the militias and calls for sealing the border between lebanon and syria and forbidding the entering of arms and weapons via the border especially to hizbullah
5031687 we havent seen any weapons coming out of the south after the war of 2006 so did hizbullah throw its weapons used in the 2006 war into the sea
5031688 if we compare what abbas will get in two weeks with what hizbullah got in the recent prisoner swap looks miniscule
5031689 the gestures have become one sided and unidirectional and are all done by israel this fails to serve israel and only harms us any move humiliating israel in the eyes of the palestinian moves shalits release further away
5031690 sitting in an israeli jail has not turned these murderers into righteous among the nations they were and still are murderers and terrorists who will seek to continue harming israelis wherever they are
5031691 the governments gesture to abbas brings us back to the oslo days during which more than 1 400 were killed and hundreds were wounded by released terrorists
5031692 despite the fact that studies on the dangers of pathological gaming and its treatments were known the defendant didnt consider its obligation to warn users of the dangers of dependence
5031693 at the current time there exists no expert recognized by his peers who proposes that vlts are the cause of pathological gambling
5031694 in using the message in moderation a game remains a game the defendant puts the responsibility of pathological gambling on the user
5031695 you got to take care of this to move on
5031696 you cant look at this game and think we played well and were going to move on its about what we do in two days
5031697 they hit a lot of 3s and love to drive and kickout for the open shot
5031698 i just happen to be in the right place at the right time
5031699 i actually thought that i missed a lot of shots early that i usually hit
5031700 i think most of us grew up watching these girls i think i was 10 years old when lisa leslie played in her first olympics it was a good experience i think we played pretty well all things considered
5031701 im surprised its a little bit late for a trade
5031702 but for me i passed my best times in this organization
5031703 sometimes guys just have off years i think that happens its a part of the game hes certainly healthy and i think a change of scenery will help him
5031704 i think going to a pennant race will help him

5031709 i cant remember much from being in a coma but i do remember that when that song came on it took me right back to when i was a youngster
5031710 i could remember how excited i was to get it down at the record shop
5031711 i suddenly had a burst of energy and knew i had a lot more life left in me and thats when i woke up to the sound of the first song i ever bought
5031712 i would love to thank mick and the rest of the stones personally i feel they really did help wake me from my coma
5031713 none of us know the circumstances under which the police felt threatened to the point of repeatedly using the taser
5031714 ill side with the police officers judgement on whether the force used was necessary 100 times out of 100
5031715 repeated prolonged and or continuous exposures to the taser may impair breathing and respiration particularly when the probes are placed across the chest or diaphragm
5031716 and you know its sad its so many incidents in south florida with these tasers
5031717 the story linked to doesnt say anything to indicate improper behaviour by police
5031718 they tased him three different times they just kept tasing him i told the police youre going to kill that man so after they did it a third time i just walked away
5031719 and they just start tasing him and tasing him until they killed him and you know its sad its so many incidents in south florida with these tasers trigger happy tasers and theyre killing people and they try to justify it
5031720 i struggled on the back nine i got a little bit stressed after the two bogeys but i started pretty well
5031721 for me it has been difficult to get that second title its been a long wait

5031727 is that some kind of lame pickup line or something
5031728 i meant it as a compliment i think meg white is a really boss chick
5031729 many of my dates even the more passive ones did most of the talking i listened to them talk literally for hours about the most minute mind numbing details of their personal lives men they were still in love with men they had divorced roommates and co workers they hated childhoods they were loath to remember yet somehow found the energy to recount ad nauseam listening to them was like undergoing a slow frontal lobotomy

5031731 nudity means the showing of the human male or female genitals pubic area or buttocks with less than a full opaque covering or the showing of the female breast with less than a fully opaque covering of any portion thereof below the top of the nipple or the depiction of covered male genitals in a discernibly turgid state
5031732 exposure of a bare female breast violates this law only when it

5031734 today marks the end of the elitist and secretive paraguay famous for its corruption
5031735 the change is not just an election question the change in paraguay is a cultural challenge perhaps the most important in its history
5031736 this is a candidate that won the elections with almost no government program
5031737 lugo is going to have to show that he can form coalitions with the old party structure
5031738 and that is something that fox was not able to do in mexico lugo has no choice but to make deals and pursue allies to help carry out his policy agenda
5031739 i have asked swiss judicial authorities for legal assistance to pass on to us all the data they have on the case and to return chens assets if it is proven that they were obtained illegally
5031740 regarding our request for legal assistance we received a positive reply
5031741 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5031742 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5031743 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5031744 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5031745 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5031746 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5031747 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5031748 i want to send my congratulations to team gb on this golden weekend for british sport
5031749 the whole country has been watching and has been thrilled by team gb we are immensely proud of what they have achieved so far and inspired by their performance
5031750 im lost for words it is such a relief our experience was everything we stayed sure and we got better
5031751 it is a shame they were werent here but huge thanks to them
5031752 i cant believe i actually won nobody expected me to win so there was no pressure
5031753 im so excited i really am i cant wait to get home
5031754 to be silver medallist im really happy it was a challenging time coming to these olympics
5031755 its about time weve been waiting for this so many great athletes have come so close and we were able to pull it off tonight
5031756 man i swear somebody jumped someone got out before the gun
5031757 i think i moved a bit there at the start and i thought they would call it
5031758 i think i false started i moved a little bit my foot
5031759 about 50 metres out i glimpsed to the sides and smiled then i powered through the line
5031760 we continue to have concerns in particular for these eight children which is why we have asked the judge to review the case
5031761 whether the children are in any immediate danger simply because their parents choose to raise them in this religion
5031762 the substance of what theyre doing here is fundamentally the same

5031764 private schools have equal and crucial roles to play in the nations quest to improve the standard of education
5031765 policy development within the education sector should therefore focus on ensuring increased support to alternative forms of learning by the poor and the vulnerable
5031766 eu acho que n o podemos reclamar quase nada do nosso torcedor mas naturalmente o corintiano um pouco impaciente talvez um pouquinho em fun o dos ltimos tempos ent o quando a equipe n o faz o resultado com rapidez e isso aconteceu um pouco dentro de casa nas ltimas vezes que jogamos acontece a cobran a
5031767 um jogador como o douglas que tem como caracter stica definir o jogo em um nico lance acaba errando porque arrisca muito
5031768 foi meu primeiro gol no pacaembu diante da torcida e foi bom porque deu tranq ilidade para a equipe na partida
5031769 a gente fica feliz de ter terminado liderando o primeiro turno mas isso n o vale nada a gente tem que fazer no segundo turno o mesmo que fizemos no primeiro

5031775 the prime minister did not speak during our brief tribute certainly not i dont think he even looked up the snarling business of question period having just ended he was shuffling papers i tried to bring him close to me with my eyes who is this man what makes him tick no doubt he is busy no doubt he is deluded by that busyness no doubt being prime minister fills his entire consideration and froths his sense of busied importance to the very brim and no doubt he sounds and governs like one who cares little for the arts but he must have moments of stillness and so this is what i propose to do not to educate that would be arrogant less than that to make suggestions to his stillness for as long as stephen harper is prime minister of canada i vow to send him every two weeks mailed on a monday a book that has been known to expand stillness that book will be inscribed and will be accompanied by a letter i will have written i will faithfully report on every new book every inscription every letter and any response i might get from the prime minister on this website

5031786 attitude and be severely critical of todd bentley my prayer is that the church will pass this test and take this opportunity to handle this situation with maturity and christ likeness and sincerely intercede for the bentley family and for fresh fire ministries
5031787 we have been in fruitful discussion with the health and education authorities and we are satisfied that the programme to be rolled out across the country now is a responsible and ethically appropriate one
5031788 we wanted to make sure any support materials were appropriate in the catholic schools and we didnt want hpv and cervical cancer to be linked with artificial contraception the factual information about the vaccine and cervical cancer are still there but it doesnt promote particular kinds of sexual behaviour we had discussions about it we looked at various forms of words and came to an agreement it took some months
5031789 the hpv vaccination will only protect young women from two strains of hpv leading to cervical cancer it is critically important that young people understand the need to use condoms to protect them from other stis
5031790 this message should be highlighted and underlined please remember this injection doesnt protect you from sexually transmitted diseases or becoming pregnant
5031791 the moral position is being imposed upon them it seems a bit archaic to let the catholic church decide on this
5031792 the hpv vaccine is about saving lives and protecting future generations of young girls from cervical cancer
5031793 scottish government officials consulted with many stakeholders and undertook research with parents and girls to ensure the right level of information was included in the leaflet the scottish government is absolutely committed to promoting safer sex and we are taking forward our sexual health strategy respect and responsibility

5031795 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5031796 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5031797 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5031798 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5031799 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5031800 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5031801 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5031802 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5031803 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5031804 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5031805 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5031806 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5031807 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5031808 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5031809 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5031810 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5031811 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5031812 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5031813 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5031814 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5031815 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5031816 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5031817 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5031818 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

5031822 i dont know what happened i cant explain what happened here this afternoon
5031823 i had done that exercise 15 or 20 times and everything had always gone well
5031824 i never imagined this could happen to me that is a routine ive been doing for years and it never went wrong
5031825 i am very sorry brazilians i should have won a medal
5031826 two days ago he successfully did that same routine during a training session so we decided to try it here

5031830 ho impiegato molto tempo e ho girato quasi tutto il mondo per imparare quello che so dellamore del destino e delle scelte che si fanno nella vita per capire lessenziale per mi bastato un istante mentre mi torturavano legato a un muro tra le urla silenziose che mi squarciavano la mente riusc a comprendere che nonostante i ceppi e la devastazione del mio corpo ero ancora libero libero di odiare gli uomini che mi stavano torturando oppure di perdonarli non sembra granch me ne rendo conto ma quando non hai altro una libert del genere rappresenta un universo sconfinato di possibilit e la scelta che fai odio o perdono pu diventare la storia della tua vita
5031831 it was a very close match between two hard working sides both teams had a lot of opportunities but they took their chances and we didnt
5031832 nigeria are a good side a mature side and a physical side that wins a lot of battles
5031833 this was our first olympics and we were a little excited and maybe that caused us to switch off for the goals only one of us could go through to the semis and unfortunately for us it was nigeria
5031834 hopefully we can qualify for south africa 2010 and perhaps you might see several of these players in the squad
5031835 it was a big victory for us and we played particularly well going forward
5031836 i was disappointed that we were not ahead at half time but we had a great second half
5031837 it was as important for us to stay tight defensively but i knew that we would create things in attack
5031838 we were very much in the game when we levelled and we could have gone on from there and won it
5031839 come come come this is my territory come play with me
5031840 oh that one ah is the neighbors kids lah it was their mums birthday so they decided to draw her a surprise and play games with her

5031843 a mans moral qualities as much as his physical resources and skills producing thereby the ideal complete athlete
5031844 words are words explanations are explanations promises are promises but only performance is reality
5031845 hes beginning to set a whole new standard for his sport and for america
5031846 the united states olympic committee is very proud of him as is usa swimming and basically every citizen in our country and in many other countries hes a true athlete and represents whats best about the olympic movement
5031847 just how difficult what hes doing is we will never see anything like it again
5031848 its a very happy marriage between someone who needed something like this and this being available
5031849 i think he still sees the water as a haven from everything else
5031850 bob and i both talked about this when im on my best when im training the best im happy im smiling at workouts im joking around im talking for the most part throughout my career im happy going in the pool
5031851 if you enjoy every moment at the pool youre bound youre guaranteed to train your best and swim your best
5031852 when it gets to be game time you can see it in his face im michael phelps and im not going to lose
5031853 when push comes to shove he is going to be there i have never seen him lose a close race
5031854 there is not one single thing person anything that can stand in my way of doing something there is not never has been
5031855 if i want something bad enough then im gonna get there thats just how i always have been if i dont get there watch out because its going to be even worse and im going to have my head on even tighter and you will not get in my way
5031856 he hands it to me and i read it he is right on the money about where he ends up almost always
5031857 pretty amazing i dont know how it comes about but thats part of it
5031858 the plan was to take it out and dare them to try and catch me
5031859 successful people make a habit of doing things that unsuccessful people dont like to do
5031860 thats it they make a habit of doing things other people arent willing to do and thats our game here
5031861 my job is to make him be the greatest michael phelps if he is that all the other things you guys can bestow on him or not my job is to help him go at the end of the day as far as he could go dealing with the other stuff is really counter productive
5031862 i will say he can be the greatest american athlete of our generation
5031863 if he has a successful summer it would be hard to not start believing that
5031864 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

5031866 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5031867 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5031868 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5031869 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5031870 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5031871 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5031872 being promoted to bbc one and gaining a wider audience
5031873 the patient must utilise the technology usefully in the correct perspective instead of dissection discussion and hair splitting
5031874 the internet which is very useful to most of us can supply ideas to the patient to gain knowledge to pose intelligent questions to the urologist and forget the actual purpose of the visit to the doctor
5031875 the urologist may have a tough time treating such patients successfully and satisfactorily
5031876 the doctor said well it looks like hes got all the symptoms of west nile virus
5031877 i called the state health department because i needed to know how long he was going to be sick
5031878 i was just bawling i thought he was going to die
5031879 he was diagnosed with epstein barr virus which is pretty much the same thing but you dont die from it
5031880 i dont blame him because all the doctors are doing it
5031881 id like to know how many people have been told they have west nile
5031882 this has been going on since west nile came into utah some doctors will base things on symptoms and not do tests
5031883 like any medical test they can be expensive and if people dont have insurance then sometimes the doctor will go ahead and try to help the patient
5031884 whether theyre helping or not may be something of a question
5031885 he said well it sounds like youve got west nile
5031886 it was really strange it was just contradictory to what we had heard on the news and what seemed to be happening everywhere
5031887 i ended up going to the doctor in the springtime
5031888 they found out that i was really anemic the question i have now is did i ever really have it am i immune to it am i going to get it again
5031889 people who have been told they have it are out on the lake not really worrying about it
5031890 i cant imagine how many people have been told that
5031891 maybe theres something seriously wrong that they dont know about and they say nah its west nile
5031892 we try to do education for physicians and stuff like that thats the best we can do is try to educate people of what tests to draw and those kinds of things
5031893 thats the only way to tell for sure if theres west nile
5031894 influx from bangladesh is a regular phenomenon with the resultant contributory factor behind the outbreak of insurgency in the state assam
5031895 if this trend is not arrested they will soon intrude upon the corridors of power
5031896 this is the first case that ive seen in my 12 years in a situation where you have patients with legitimate and serious problems who are receiving a drug that is not authorized by the food drug and administration
5031897 it aint for us to say who goes to jail for the rest of their life who am i to judge
5031898 if theres people arguing in front of me and someone gets shot i mind my business thats the hood its principle and theres rules to the hood that you mind your business
5031899 i hope that soon youll see broader support for refuges from the international community which will render all necessary assistance

5031911 di lap terakhir sebelum stoner berhenti saya tertinggal 1 3 detik darinya saya sangat yakin saya dapat mengejarnya balapan masih sangat panjang dan saya berpikir saya bisa setelah itu saya melihat motor merah tergelincir dan saya rasa ah ini sangatlah mudah
5031912 ini merupakan keuntungan yang penting namun masih terlalu dini masih ada enam balapan yang harus dilewati jadi jika saya dapat terus seperti ini saya akan mencoba mengalahkannya kalau tak mungkin saya akan finis di belakangnya tidak di bawah posisi kedua

5031932 he had requested to be traded this year throughout the year
5031933 we attempted to do so by the trade deadline and just were not able to make a deal that made sense for us with a month and a half left before free agency we felt we needed to get something for him
5031934 im so happy with my performance i won an olympic gold for the second time
5031935 the race was fantastic there was no pacemaker and everyone was pushing no one could push any harder
5031936 it is a big gift i will now try to run the 5 000m it is not easy to run the two events it will be a strong race

5031973 this couldnt have happened to her so close to the finish line and just to be like that it must have been horrific for her out there
5031974 i may have to say no actually i was last
5031975 so when it happened on kilometer 39 with two miles to go i thought for sure i was done i thought there was no way i never felt pain like that running in my whole life i dont understand what happened i was drinking every station i was taking three gels i dont understand why i got such bad cramps
5031976 when i was sitting there looking at the stadium and i just couldnt move because it was just pulling so strong i didnt think i was going to finish the race
5031977 i said to myself even if it takes me a half an hour i just have to give myself a chance to finish
5031978 that was probably the most magical moment of my whole olympics
5031979 i went through that gate knowing that whatever happens i have only one lap to go and i will finish this race that i think was the first time that i really believed i was going to finish

5032000 minha maior falha moral e sou uma pessoa muito imperfeita foi o fracasso de meu primeiro casamento
5032001 talvez n o nos tenhamos dedicado suficientemente a quest es maiores que nosso interesse pr prio embora tenhamos sido os melhores nisso
5032002 n s que fazemos as campanhas educativas e projetos de educa o no tr nsito vemos que elas as campanhas n o est o sendo suficientes a curto prazo creio que uma lei mais rigorosa vai reduzir bastante o risco de acidentes graves e mortes principalmente ocasionados por motoristas embriagados
5032003 s de o motorista ter consci ncia de que a puni o ser mais severa ele ter mais cuidado como j est ocorrendo desde a aplica o da lei seca
5032004 essa mudan a de h bito tamb m passa pelo uso do cinto de seguran a da cadeira para as crian as e as empresas colocarem
5032005 em plena guerra fria e ainda sob o tratado de yalta o ocidente n o queria ter nada a ver com nosso combate est vamos novamente sozinhos na adversidade como em setembro de 1938 em munique contra hitler
5032006 por que em agosto de 1968 o ocidente deveria sair em defesa de alguns idealistas que queriam reformar o comunismo contra a hegemonia sovi tica
5032007 o ocidente s via nisso a oportunidade de enfraquecer o campo sovi tico
5032008 a primavera de praga foi a ltima tentativa de reformar o comunismo a invas o foi a morte anunciada do marxismo leninismo
5032009 foi um bom trabalho falta conquistar um dos objetivos tra ados para a temporada pois s se sai satisfeito quando atinge algo maior o retorno primeira divis o sab amos que seria um ano dif cil e n o t nhamos ilus o quanto a isso mas estamos passando bem
5032010 porque ele tinha mais condi es de fazer o que pens vamos para o in cio do jogo
5032011 t nhamos duas op es uma era o morais e a outra era o willian sabia que o willian seria muito dif cil at porque outros clubes j haviam contatado o shakhtar para repatri lo e ouvido o n o como resposta assim como eu
5032012 o presidente confia muito no willian tanto que pagou us 19 milh es por ele e fez contrato por quatro anos ele acredita que dentro de dois ou tr s anos poder vend lo a outro clube da europa
5032013 acho dif cil temos at o dia 31 ainda mas est complicado trazer o brand o ele acabou de renovar o contrato por quatro anos dolo do time na ucr nia maior artilheiro da hist ria do shakhtar dif cil vir para o corinthians este ano
5032014 dif cil voc encontrar um atacante de n vel dispon vel no mercado pois todos os grandes atacantes est o empregados e bem empregados
5032015 se acontecer alguma facilidade o corinthians ir sim contratar um jogador a inten o fazer um contrato mais longo para o pr ximo ano para n o corrermos o risco de perd lo em dezembro
5032016 as equipes estar o certamente melhor preparadas de um modo geral e tamb m mais pressionadas por motivos diferentes
5032017 quando come a o campeonato voc tem 38 rodadas pela frente para manter ou fazer recupera o mas agora s h mais 19 alguns j ficaram para tr s e isso come a a pressionar o am rica que n s enfrentamos hoje s bado perdeu apenas tr s nos ltimos 11 jogos j mostrando uma mudan a de comportamento raciocinou n o podemos descuidar de nada pois os jogos ter o grau de dificuldade maior espero que o comportamento do nosso time pelo menos continue sendo o mesmo
5032018 no primeiro gol dividi com o zagueiro e ela sobrou na frente o goleiro adiantou um pouquinho e marquei no segundo o zagueiro me ajudou um pouquinho mas valeu vencemos por 2 a 0 e est timo todos est o de parab ns
5032019 vamos ter uma conversa como fa o com todos os novos jogadores e deixar alguns pontos importantes absolutamente claros para que o jogador possa render bem
5032020 todo jogador quer atuar bem e ele v no t cnico algu m para ajud lo aqui no corinthians n s vamos fazer de tudo para que o morais se sinta bem
5032021 n o temos que colocar em cima de um s jogador a responsabilidade de resolver os problemas da equipe at porque os nossos problemas n o s o t o graves assim
5032022 n o podemos reclamar de nada do nosso torcedor mas naturalmente o corintiano um pouco impaciente
5032023 quando a equipe n o deslancha acaba sendo criada uma certa impaci ncia mas um jogador como o douglas que tem a capacidade de definir o jogo em um lance tamb m tem o direito de errar quem n o arrisca n o cria nada diferente
5032024 eu sempre tive confian a que ele se recuperaria das fases dif ceis o lulinha muito jovem e s vezes fica um pouco inst vel por isso acaba tentando complicar lances f ceis estamos trabalhando para que seja mais constante e mais decisivo

5032056 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo

5032065 father amertons thoughts it seemed were also responding in the same manner
5032066 where did he live how was he born how did he die
5032067 the key to general happiness is to be born again and reformed in the likeness of god
5032068 happy is the man who succeeds in reforming himself with gods help thereby becoming the image of god in the truest sense representing the maker of man and the universe like a living mirror closely resembling him and accepting him
5032069 apart from this way of returning unto and into ones individual self and unto and into god there is no possible hope of salvation no peace and no happiness
5032070 therefore no matter who you are you must reform yourself according to gods good pleasure and with his help so that angels and pious men are able as it were to read on your forehead the inscription here is a splendid image of god
5032071 acho at que tivemos uma boa atua o mas erramos demais a ltima bola criamos as jogadas e poder amos ter feito gols no primeiro tempo mas no finalzinho come amos a fazer liga es diretas e isso n o poderia acontecer
5032072 nossos volantes ficaram de costas para o zagueiro e a bola come ou a bater e voltar pois o herrera n o pode jogar virado de costas para o gol isso facilitou a marca o do am rica
5032073 pedi tranq ilidade e que mantivessem a organiza o foi o que a gente fez aceleramos um pouco mais e fomos criando at marcar o gol que nos deu a calma para continuar a partida
5032074 quando o torcedor vaia o t cnico n o precisa ser muito veemente ele faz o caminho inverso conversa a equipe foi superior tomou iniciativa a grande mudan a para o segundo tempo foi o aparecimento dos gols que deram tranq ilidade para jogar
5032075 importante ressaltar que jogamos praticamente contra todos os times que est o em cima da tabela em suas casas mas no returno os jogos ser o no pacaembu e todos sabemos que isso pesa e faz mesmo a diferen a
5032076 nossos jogos dentro de casa t m sido mais complicados todo mundo que vem aqui fica com dez jogadores l atr s bem mais complicado para n s jogar em casa do que fora
5032077 no in cio do campeonato as equipes estavam se acertando agora a maioria est em momento ruim e temos que aproveitar isso para crescer de novo na classifica o
5032078 muito dif cil uma equipe liderar desde a primeira rodada e manter sempre o mesmo n vel mas fizemos um bom jogo diante do ava e isso o que estamos procurando tentaremos manter o n vel contra o am rica
5032079 dificilmente uma equipe come ar um campeonato 100 e terminar da mesma forma vamos trabalhar duro pois na hora certa a seq ncia de vit rias voltar como foi no in cio da competi o
5032080 ainda vou decidir o denis n o vive um bom momento mas o alessandro est retornando de les o preciso pensar melhor
5032081 o eduardo ramos est tendo dificuldades no seu novo posicionamento e o lulinha tem feito melhor essa fun o de jogar pelos lados
5032082 vi o brand o atuar algumas vezes pelo s o caetano e em outros jogos pelo shakhtar ele um centroavante de rea algo que faz falta em nosso grupo
5032083 o william est com 32 para 33 anos n o mais um menino e cabe comiss o t cnica ter um pouco de cuidado o dentinho levou uma pancada e procuramos evitar contato nos primeiros dias ap s o ocorrido mas os dois est o confirmados no time
5032084 testei o alessandro no meio e o lulinha um pouco mais avan ado para testar situa es de jogo mas minha d vida entre o denis e o alessandro na lateral direita vou pensar um pouco mais e definir hoje sexta noite
5032085 est vamos precisando fazer um jogo bom contra o ava e mesmo n o repetindo o futebol apresentado contra o juventude conseguimos agora precisamos manter esse n vel
5032086 bom estar voltando e estou em plenas condi es f sicas e t cnicas para jogar se o mano precisar de mim vai faltar um pouco de ritmo mas para mim o importante foi ter me recuperado da les o pois isso estava me incomodando muito
5032087 um jogador que tem bastante mobilidade e boa defini o vai qualificar bastante o nosso plantel
5032088 n o gosto de criar problemas por antecipa o espero que venha para ser uma das solu es do meio para a frente mas preciso ver seu posicionamento e suas caracter sticas ao lado dos novos companheiros no dia a dia
5032089 ele um jogador que aprovou aqui e n s gostamos muito dele o herrera tem a cara do corinthians e se encaixa perfeitamente naquilo que o corinthians
5032090 o corinthians passa por problemas financeiros e estamos tentando uma negocia o para reduzir os n meros quem est cuidando disso pessoalmente o presidente andr s sanchez mas se dar certo ou n o uma outra quest o
5032091 o corinthians um caso parte ele j tem uma vaga seja na posi o que for entre os quatro da frente eles t m um time forte e n o sentem a press o o corinthians vinha de uma derrota foi jogar com a gente em nossa casa e conseguiu o empate
5032092 nossa meta se distanciar do quinto colocado e acho dif cil de ganharmos o primeiro turno porque acredito que o corinthians deve vencer o am rica no pacaembu

5032123 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
5032124 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
5032125 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5032126 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

5032138 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5032139 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5032140 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5032141 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5032142 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5032143 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5032144 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5032145 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5032146 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5032147 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5032148 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5032149 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5032150 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5032151 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5032152 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5032153 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5032154 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
5032155 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
5032156 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
5032157 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
5032158 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
5032159 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
5032160 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
5032161 ha sido un buen rallye y estoy contento de nuestra actuaci n una vez que solucionamos los problemas del primer d a comentaba sordo
5032162 the retail economy is down people are not spending so companies are cutting back on their budgets
5032163 they are scared of the rising interest rates and when they are not spending retail is down and advertising is down

5032168 if youre going to have a rain dance wouldnt you have to have rain dance practice and what im wondering is does it rain during practice because if it doesnt how do you know if you have it right and if it does why bother with the dance in the first place need a little water call practice
5032169 god can make it rain tomorrow he can make it rain next week or next month
5032170 we come here very reverently and respectfully to pray up a storm
5032171 christianity has more of a place in the culture here than in some other region
5032172 god can make it rain tomorrow he can make it rain next week or next month
5032173 universities attack on christians knows no end when believers are prevented from associating with one another
5032174 christian student groups cannot be singled out for discrimination the right to associate with people of like mind and interest applies to all student groups on a public university campus
5032175 we expect you to believe x y and z and do a b and c
5032176 wonder if he also asked what the riders are who is this strider fellow and why is he held in such esteem and how do they know its the one ring

5032182 storm rains down on the farmhouse kitchen at the stourhead show
5032183 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
5032184 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
5032185 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
5032186 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
5032187 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
5032188 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
5032189 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
5032190 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
5032191 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
5032192 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
5032193 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
5032194 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
5032195 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
5032196 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
5032197 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
5032198 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
5032199 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
5032200 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
5032201 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
5032202 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
5032203 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
5032204 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
5032205 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
5032206 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5032207 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5032208 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5032209 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5032210 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
5032211 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5032212 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5032213 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5032214 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5032215 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5032216 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5032217 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5032218 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5032219 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5032220 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5032221 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5032222 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5032223 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5032224 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5032225 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5032226 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5032227 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5032228 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5032229 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5032230 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5032231 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5032232 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5032233 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5032234 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5032235 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5032236 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5032237 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5032238 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5032239 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5032240 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5032241 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5032242 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales

5032244 in todays and yesterdays clashes at least 23 people have been killed on both sides and 28 others were injured
5032245 the standard advice we got was to never agree to an interview unless you will get to see the piece before publication and have a say in whether it will run or not most serious outlets will agree to this
5032246 id like to see my quotes before you run the story
5032247 well at least your paper in x journal sets the record straight
5032248 i work for a state agency on the one hand we are told that outreach and public education are important on the other hand we are often reminded to have our communications with the public run through the information bureau
5032249 take a media training class learn how the media works and how to use it to your advantage just like politicians do
5032250 researchers could also examine how other professions manage the media politicians are misrepresented more frequently and significantly than scientists but they know that attacking journalists is a short sighted strategy instead they have become experts in rebutting inaccurate stories and imparting their own message how far should scientists go down this road scientists as with almost every other profession enjoy more public trust than politicians gaining a reputation for spin could damage this researchers should however learn what the media wants politicians understand the kind of stories that journalists are looking for if more scientists did too they would be better equipped to get their message across
5032251 tough im going with how ive got it im not going to let you make changes unless something is factually incorrect
5032252 im not prepared to answer that at this very second can i call you right back
5032253 its science that has the problem just look around collect data science is the odd man out the rest of our society functions very differently that does science
5032254 but science is also highly artificial and sequestered the rest of society currently undergoing very rapid change doesnt even remotely function like science
5032255 and speaking of arrogance youre being asked to explain something in plain language not to
5032256 the thing is like many games you need to ignore the grognards because they love the game so much they kill it and nail it down under a nice piece of glass where it can stay pristine and untouched

5032324 they were telling us that we had a plane hit us in the pentagon and we now realized we were under attack wtc 7 could have been a target it could have been a serious target
5032325 with a very confused look he said who told you that
5032326 i found chief ganci we got a message that the buildings are going to collapse
5032327 even though these results are very good they may also show that children today live lives where critics may say that they are overprotected
5032328 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5032329 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5032330 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5032331 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5032332 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5032333 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5032334 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5032335 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5032336 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5032337 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5032338 guten morgen wie ich euch vor den ferien angek ndigt habe bekommt ihr einen neuen mitsch ler
5032339 das ist lucian haides er wohnt seit drei wochen in thornway deshalb bitte ich euch ihm in den n chsten tagen etwas unter die arme zu greifen
5032340 wie ich hei e wisst ihr inzwischen ich bin lucian ansonsten gibt es nicht viel ber mich zu sagen wenn ihr fragen habt k nnt ihr sie aber gerne stellen
5032341 stimmt es dass dein vater der neue chefarzt in unserem krankenhaus ist meine mutter arbeitet dort und hat erz hlt dass ein kollege aus nebraska vor kurzem auf ihrer station angefangen hat
5032342 i made a few easy mistakes but he played really really solid
5032343 you would probably have to put him as a darkhorse he s someone to watch
5032344 i think there wasnt an exclusivity to women in this country women between the age group of 25 65 and sometimes beyond 65 come here and they have universal kind of desire that they just want to live life all of them have travel wish lists which they haven t fulfilled and i tell them how to fulfill them
5032345 i love travelling and have travelled to many countries but about a year and half ago i became single and didnt want to stop travelling i think this is a brilliant concept for women who want to travel and are separated from their men folk
5032346 i think with the changing economy women are becoming really independent and having resources to travel by themselves this club is for all the women who have reached a certain status in their lives and are financially independent and i dont think they are feminists they love going out by themselves which they cannot do with men but i think they still love men
5032347 i made a few easy mistakes but he played really really solid
5032348 you would probably have to put him as a darkhorse he s someone to watch
5032349 the lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit
5032350 a cheerful heart is good medicine but a crushed spirit dries up the bones

5032359 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
5032360 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5032361 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5032362 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas

5032383 he wanted to help get children away from a life of crime and violence
5032384 thats why hes the king of comedy he never lost his soul in chicago
5032385 was having some health issues but he always said to me every morning that he was always good
5032386 he always had time to shake a hand he was always that kid from chicago who wanted to make everybody happy and everybody laugh
5032387 thank you bernie for showing that good people do come from englewood
5032388 bernie would wear colors that crayons hadnt even thought of yet
5032389 all he talked about was his family and this city
5032390 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5032391 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5032392 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5032393 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5032394 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5032395 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5032396 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5032397 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5032398 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5032399 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5032400 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5032401 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5032402 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5032403 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5032404 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5032405 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5032406 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5032407 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5032408 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5032409 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5032410 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5032411 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5032412 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5032413 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5032414 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5032415 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5032416 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5032417 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5032418 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5032419 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5032420 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5032421 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5032422 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5032423 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5032424 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5032425 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5032426 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5032427 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5032428 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5032429 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5032430 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5032431 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
5032432 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5032433 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5032434 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
5032435 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5032436 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5032437 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5032438 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5032439 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5032440 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5032441 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5032442 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5032443 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5032444 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5032445 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5032446 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5032447 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5032448 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5032449 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty

5032486 back then i was a chao ah beng who didnt care what i did and whom i mixed around with i disliked going back home and even rented an apartment above bugis market so i could hang out more with my friends around areas nearby clubs and pubs
5032487 when she came to visit me after my transfer to reform school she lost so much weight i couldnt even recognize her
5032488 initially it was tough getting a job especially in the era where a growing number of university grads are vying for a single job moreover im just a psle cert holder

5032490 also its both your family and friends who are suffering while youre placed behind bars
5032491 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5032492 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 wide open
5032493 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5032494 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5032495 we historically dont make our decisions within a 24 hour period it takes time to get everybody in a group and talk about it
5032496 j d was just going to go back and discuss things with his team he was apologetic for what happened to put everyone in this situation
5032497 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5032498 it was the strangest thing ive ever seen they looked as if they were on fire really bright orange orbs
5032499 they definitely werent helicopters or planes and there was no smoke or sound
5032500 we saw one through the trees just as it was disappearing another one came from the same direction

5032509 whatever are you having that on your back for karena
5032510 its a traditional dragon design which all amazonians have when they get married but its not elisia the dragon of good luck and fertility but instead you have morosia the dragon of misery
5032511 it started out with a kiss how did it end up like this it was only a kiss it was only a kiss

5032524 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5032525 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5032526 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5032527 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5032631 we think cap and trade is an important way to go
5032632 it fits in better with what other jurisdictions are doing and it guarantees emission reductions
5032633 this is an exploration of an area of emissions trading that could be included in a future program for us
5032634 if farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers in a better way and reduce those emissions that come off their field then were further ahead in terms of the total amount of greenhouse gases that are getting released from human operations
5032635 instead of opening up the soil by tilling it really actively where you get a lot of carbon released and get nitrous oxide released during that process if you keep it closed it keeps the carbon sequestered in the soil
5032636 by growing new trees youre taking carbon out of the air and youre putting it into the wood and sequestering it there
5032637 on a national scale we are 10 per cent of the problem with greenhouse gas emissions but we can be 20 per cent of the solution
5032638 and the pilots that are being identified here in ontario are also things that can be used at the national scale
5032639 society has to recognize farmers are willing to do this but we cant do it were not paid to assist

5032645 when these students have positive experiences at hopkins they will return to their home institutions with good stories to share with their classmates the next year we always see more admission applications from those schools

5032651 as mechanical engineering looks to 2028 leaders will value people with diverse expertise and experience they will bring this global profession together to keep the promise of technology serving people they will inspire men and women everywhere to believe that grand challenges are a rally cry for a profession that is ready for the adventure of making the difficult doable
5032652 we spent more than two years working with jeremy wariner the best curve runner in the world to design the adidas lone star

5032667 thats where i am right now when we show up and do that kind of stuff at home i take it real serious i think our players do too we have to do something about it
5032668 we need to take a serious hard look at all of this and i know i have to from my standpoint im sure i havent done my job
5032669 there will be some positives and im sure some guys did some good things you can analyze it that way
5032670 its been pointed out to us quite verbally by coach gibbs

5032673 after the great tunes and hanks mournful voice the next thing you think about in those songs is the steel guitar
5032674 it is the quintessential honky tonk steel sound tuneful aggressive full of attitude
5032675 his tuning and the way the tuning made the tone high pitched matched hank williams style just perfectly
5032676 i played him an intro and we sang the song through one time
5032677 he remained an active musician until the day he died
5032678 don would look out over the audience as the lights dimmed
5032679 then hed say now close your eyes and think of hank
5032680 anyone can give up its the easiest thing in the world to do but to hold it together when everyone else would understand if you fell apart thats true strength
5032681 god didnt promise days without pain laughter without sorrow sun without rain but he did promise strength for the day comfort for the tears and light for the way
5032682 there is a sacredness in tears they are not the mark of weakness but of power they speak more eloquently than ten thousand tongues they are messengers of overwhelming grief and unspeakable love
5032683 gods promises are like the stars the darker the night the brighter they shine
5032684 this is my wish for you comfort on difficult days smiles when sadness intrudes rainbows to follow the clouds laughter to kiss your lips sunsets to warm your heart hugs when spirits sag beauty for your eyes to see friendships to brighten your being faith so that you can believe confidence for when you doubt courage to know yourself patience to accept the truth love to complete your life
5032685 if i never met you i wouldnt like you if i didnt like you i wouldnt love you if i didnt love you i wouldnt miss you but i did i do and i will

5032688 shared joy is a double joy shared sorrow is half a sorrow
5032689 it is a curious thought but it is only when you see people looking ridiculous that you realize just how much you love them
5032690 you must not blame me if i do talk to the clouds
5032691 whats the use of a fine house if you havent got a tolerable planet to put it on
5032692 how vain it is to sit down to write when you have not stood up to live
5032693 never look back unless you are planning to go that way
5032694 even though weve changed and were all finding our own place in the world we all know that when the tears fall or the smile spreads across our face well come to each other because no matter where this crazy world takes us nothing will ever change so much to the point where were not all still friends
5032695 being happy doesnt mean that everything is perfect it means that youve decided to look beyond the imperfections
5032696 dream as if youll live forever live as if youll die today
5032697 the most important thing in life is to learn how to give out love and to let it come in
5032698 so many people walk around with a meaningless life they seem half asleep even when theyre busy doing things they think are important this is because theyre chasing the wrong things the way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to christ devote yourself to loving others devote yourself to your community around you and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning
5032699 i dont need a friend who changes when i change and who nods when i nod my shadow does that much better
5032700 dont walk in front of me i may not follow dont walk behind me i may not lead just walk beside me and be my friend
5032701 i laugh i love i hope i try i hurt i need i fear i cry and i know you do the same things too so were really not that different me and you
5032702 i miss you when something really good happens because you are the one i want to share it with i miss you when something is troubling me because you are the one who understands me so well i miss you when i laugh and cry because i know that you are the one that makes my laughter grow and my tears disappear i miss you all the time but i miss you most when i lay awake at night and think of all the wonderful times we spent with eachother for those were some of the best times of my life
5032703 as i look back on all thats happened growing up growing together changing you changing me there were times when we dreamed together when we laughed and cried together as i look back on those days i realize how much i truly miss you and how much i truly love you the past may be gone forever and whatever the future holds our todays make the memories of tomorrow so my lifetime friend it is with all my heart that i send you my love hoping that youll always carry my smile with you for all we have meant to each other and for whatever the future may hold

5032713 it was a great performance im very happy to win a medal but especially the gold at the world championships in canada 2005 everybody said i could not run but today i have showed what i can do
5032714 i dont have a name for it but its its new run i think its not rerun because everything is new the drawing is new the punchlines are new everything is new the only thing that is retro is the way im drawing everything because i want it to flow into the classic material seamlessly if i can and its a challenge but im really enjoying it

5032783 but i believe well wind up ahead weve got the volunteers the excitement his call for economic change the trade issue a lot of these things make north carolina fertile territory for us
5032784 i dont disavow that on paper this could be closer than last time and obama is spending money
5032785 my question is can you move this 13 14 points from where you were when you had a north carolinian on the ticket
5032786 definitely there is the real potential for black voters to become a more substantial part of the electorate this year
5032787 if people see barack obama watching out for them on the economy
5032788 democrats who get elected in north carolina are not northeastern liberal democrats
5032789 democrats who are successful in north carolina and virginia and other conservative states tend to be centrists and moderates especially on the second amendment
5032790 the thought that north carolina could vote for a democrat made me think that if theres something i could do to make that happen that would be valuable
5032791 i figure if my mother in law who is fairly conservative told me out of the blue that she was planning to vote for obama he has a chance in this state

5032887 i am still a student but this was an order from the commander of the academy that we should come out and search the vehicles that is why i am here now
5032888 such a provocation would only be staged by the russian side with the aim of keeping russian military units in the conflict zone
5032889 we were the first in so well be the last out
5032890 every free independent country can together with nato members discuss when it can join nato in december we will have a first evaluation of the situation and we are on a clear path in the direction of nato membership

5032900 i have a mission something bigger than myself and my music
5032901 what we should learn from history is that preventive war doesnt work the iraq war didnt work and therefore we should abandon notions such as the bush doctrine of preventive war we should return to the just war tradition which sees force as something that is only used as a last resort which sees war as something that is justifiable for defensive purposes
5032902 as the imperial presidency has accrued power surrounding the imperial presidency has come to be this group of institutions called the national security state the cia the joint chiefs of staff the office of the secretary of defense the other intelligence agencies now these have grown since the end of world war two into this mammoth enterprise
5032903 the elements of continuity outweigh the elements of change and its not going to happen because ultimately we the american people refuse to look in that mirror and to see the extent to which the problems that we face really lie within we refuse to live within our means we continue to think that the problems that beset the country are out there beyond our borders and that if we deploy sufficient amount of american power we can fix those problems and therefore things back here will continue as they have for decades
5032904 our foreign policy is not something simply concocted by people in washington d c and imposed on us our foreign policy is something that is concocted in washington d c but it reflects the perceptions of our political elite about what we want we the people want and what we want by and large i mean one could point to many individual exceptions but what we want by and large is we want this continuing flow of very cheap consumer goods
5032905 the most obvious the blindingly obviously question is energy its oil i think historians a hundred years from now will puzzle over how it could be that the united states of america the most powerful nation in the world as far back as the early 1970s came to recognize that dependence on foreign oil was a problem posed a threat comprised our freedom of action
5032906 how every president from richard nixon down to the present one president bush declared were gonna fix this problem none of them did and the reason we are in iraq today is because the persian gulf is at the center of the worlds oil reserves i dont mean that we invaded iraq on behalf of big oil but the persian gulf region would have zero strategic significance were it not for the fact that thats where the oil is
5032907 were headed down a path in which not only will we become increasingly dependent upon foreign oil but we will have opted for a false model of freedom a freedom of materialism a freedom of self indulgence a freedom of collective recklessness

5032909 at uc berkeley ee100 is the introduction to electrical engineering class for non ee majors the goal of this course is to serve as a hands on electronics class we use multisim in the ee100 course because it is easy to use and abstracts the messy details of spice multisim also provides very useful features like the breadboard tool and instruments like the multimeter we can show students how to wire an ammeter without blowing fuses multisim also integrates with labview and this helps our students compare simulation data to experimental data

5032913 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5032914 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5032915 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5032916 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5032917 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5032918 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5032919 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5032920 dinner pail was a communication of the time meaning lunch box when dinner was lunch time supper was the evening meal
5032921 many of us grew up when tv guide and the sunday newspaper tv book were king filled with listings stories photos puzzles and special features with televisions popularity who could have imagined their demise
5032922 if this helps anyone out there who is in their middle aged years and has put off what they wanted to do because they thought they were too old or because they have a child and that they cant balance what they want to do with being a parent then thats great what ive done is show them that they can do it
5032923 it was thought that if youre getting to 16 17 or 18 youre getting to the end of your career dara has done a fantastic job in proving that you can continue to improve and that women can have children and get back into the sport she has gotten rid of a mythology in swimming that has been there for so long
5032924 we simply must do everything we can in our power to slow down global warming before it is too late the science is clear the global warming debate is over
5032925 americans are coming to understand that global temperatures have actually cooled over the last 10 years and are predicted to continue cooling over the next 10
5032926 if you look from 1995 you dont see any change that could be regarded as statistically significant for the last 13 or 14 years nothing has been happening
5032927 if you take the last 30 years its completely evident that its going up
5032928 we hate to inconvenience those visitors that had plans to be in the keys the next few days but their well being is our top priority
5032929 weve been living in florida now for 10 years so we need to get some stuff together but were not going to rush out of here
5032930 weve got to get back and buckle up our own house
5032931 my aim wasnt to beat the chinese or any other nationality
5032932 residents should hoist the red and white flag three days before and three days after the independence day
5032933 we have to give the highest appreciation for our independence fought so hardly by our heroes
5032934 i urge residents to report to the officers if there is anybody who did not raise the flag
5032935 naseem said a woman should not be a ruler in an islamic country he said it contravenes islamic principles
5032936 some mdp national council members said it can be done because women have been rulers in other islamic countries and the constitution does not prohibit it
5032937 we considered that he left the party after the primary today is just a formality
5032938 the child on the screen should be flawless in image in her internal feelings and in her expression in the matter of her voice yang peiyi was flawless in the unanimous opinion of all the members of the team

5032947 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
5032948 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
5032949 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
5032950 if its a poor choice you spend the next 60 days worrying about the other plane
5032951 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
5032952 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
5032953 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
5032954 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
5032955 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
5032956 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
5032957 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
5032958 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
5032959 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
5032960 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
5032961 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
5032962 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
5032963 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
5032964 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
5032965 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
5032966 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify
5032967 im not interested in a vice president who i send off to go to funerals
5032968 i want somebody who is going to roll up their sleeves and be willing to work
5032969 i am aware of the enhanced importance of this issue given my age
5032970 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
5032971 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
5032972 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
5032973 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
5032974 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
5032975 a key statistical procedure on which many past epidemiological studies had relied was flawed
5032976 emissions of smog producing pollutants decreased both nationally and regionally between 1990 and 2000
5032977 both decreased substantially nationally and regionally with statistically significant downward trends nationally no levels in 2005 were about 50 lower than in 1991 and no2 about 30 lower
5032978 one million to die from smog related illnesses in the next two years
5032979 the most problematic aspect of the cmas research is the assumption that air pollution kills
5032980 was it about one more blogger in love with the sound of his own voice and not much in the way of insight to offer

5032982 i know what fire does and with global warming and the water issues we have fire looms its ugly head much more formidably than it has in the past
5032983 on august 21 there will be a national premier of the film in 400 theaters across the nation the film purports to be an entertaining analysis of the serious financial situation facing america regarding its national debt and fiscal irresponsibility
5032984 from its trailer and description it sounds suspiciously like a hokey concoction ala al gores an inconvenient truth put together by louis xvis financial ministers on the eve of the storming of the bastille blaming all our troubles on sunspots or the humble snail darter
5032985 the premier will also feature a live panel discussion after the film of distinguished experts filling in to the suckers who viewed this fiasco what they just saw they include peterson walker billionaire investor warren buffet and cato institute chairman william me too niskanen
5032986 heres what we wont be hearing from these esteemed gentlemen
5032987 poor david rockefeller his grandfather senator nelson aldrich created this monstrosity the federal reserve thats responsible for all that we saw in the film and now the ignorant masses will be coming after him in a blind fit of revenge theyll be coming after all of us like they did the aristocrats in france were closing down the harold pratt house in new york and moving the cfr headquarters to a secure bunker in virginia

5032997 if we lose the funding we get we would have to cut even more services to make up that money
5032998 all theyre asking for is just to restore what they had
5032999 first of all its not a 911 tax thats 100 percent false because the only way that that tax can be devoted for 911 service is it has to be deemed a special tax
5033000 theyre sending out this message its for 911 service but there is no guarantee absolutely no guarantee that money will go for 911
5033001 everybody should vote no because all three of these are being presented in a very dishonest manner
5033002 it is very very difficult to get the votes necessary for a special
5033003 the 911 bill is something that needs to be paid every year its not something that we can redirect
5033004 id rather give my buck to the bum than the city officials
5033005 this is nothing against 911 service im not coming along and saying i dont want 911 service this is not against them this is not against those employees
5033006 do we have one less dispatcher on duty its a difficult decision
5033007 all the dispatchers are cross trained so they can do anything
5033008 some days were just sitting here doing nothing and then boom
5033009 you cant eliminate 911 but certainly could reduce it and all of that goes to the response times seconds matter here
5033010 if you can save two minutes well try holding your breath for two minutes
5033011 ive taken the action because someone had to this government is trying to force this on the people and someone had to stand up and say that there is no evidence to support it
5033012 on the face of it this applicant would seem to face some insurmountable obstacles in bringing this action
5033013 i want to win if i lose what a tragedy to think about that 2 billion plus that our country will give for no return each year im not going to let that happen without attempting to stop it
5033014 dr paul is non interventionist and does not want us intervening in the affairs of others
5033015 its certainly good to have attention drawn to the issues of the libertarian party
5033016 being a third party candidate is very different a lot of republicans like to donate to republicans you just have to keep on plugging
5033017 it could be that a few thousand votes tip the balance

5033026 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
5033027 supports privatization tax cuts and government spending cuts and opposes laws that limit spending by non party organizations during election campaigns
5033028 in order to attract votes the harper government has combined tax cuts with big spending the effect being to suck the treasury dry

5033055 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5033056 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system
5033057 georgia will if it wants and it does want to become a member of nato

5033067 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
5033068 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
5033069 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion

5033099 what do i think about western civilization i think its a very good idea
5033100 truth force his force of personality and intelligence his writings take up some 90 volumes andtheyre large ones are legendary
5033101 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5033102 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5033103 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5033104 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5033105 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5033106 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5033107 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5033108 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5033109 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5033110 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5033111 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5033112 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5033113 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5033114 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5033115 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5033116 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5033117 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5033118 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5033119 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5033120 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5033121 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5033122 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5033123 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5033124 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5033125 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5033126 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5033127 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5033128 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5033129 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5033130 this is a planning took where all things are going
5033131 whats the most gut wrenching decision youve ever had to make
5033132 as tough a decision that ive had to make not only because there were political consequences but also because saddam hussein was a bad person and there was no doubt he meant america ill
5033133 we had a code of conduct that said you only leave by order of capture
5033134 in the spirit of full disclosure im very happy i didnt know the war was going to last for another three years or so
5033135 went against party loyalty and maybe even against your own best interest for the good of america
5033136 well ill give you an example that in fact i worked with john mccain on
5033137 and that was the issue of campaign ethics reform and finance reform
5033138 my knowledge and my background told me that a few hundred marines in a situation like that could not successfully carry out any kind of peacekeeping mission and i thought they were going into harms way
5033139 what would be the greatest moral failure in your life and what would be the greatest moral failure of america
5033140 the failure of my first marriage its my greatest moral failure
5033141 he could have avoided that altogether or come up with some other answer
5033142 but he very quickly cleanly and clearly confessed his failure
5033143 the clarity of confessing his failure there will be respect in the evangelical community for doing so
5033144 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
5033145 well i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5033146 but let me just speak more generally about the issue of abortion because this is something obviously the country wrestles with one thing that im absolutely convinced of is there is a moral and ethical content to this issue so i think that anybody who tries to deny the moral difficulties and gravity of the abortion issue i think is not paying attention so that would be point number one
5033147 at the moment of conception i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5033148 abortion and marriage are still pivotal issues but i think that abortion is probably more pivotal than marriage
5033149 abortion is still very very solid with this group even the younger ones who are more liberal on marriage life is a real delineating factor
5033150 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5033151 despite the fact that studies on the dangers of pathological gaming and its treatments were known the defendant didnt consider its obligation to warn users of the dangers of dependence
5033152 at the current time there exists no expert recognized by his peers who proposes that vlts are the cause of pathological gambling
5033153 in using the message in moderation a game remains a game the defendant puts the responsibility of pathological gambling on the user
5033154 do you know what it means to miss new orleans
5033155 this is such a stupid exercise damn this is hard
5033156 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5033157 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5033158 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5033159 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5033160 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5033161 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5033162 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5033163 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
5033164 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
5033165 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
5033166 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
5033167 our 14 offices are part of a highly structured volunteer heavy plan to win in new hampshire
5033168 we are creating neighborhood teams with volunteers who are trained equipped and empowered to build a campaign organization in their own neighborhood
5033169 i think weve built on that grass roots effort from 2004
5033170 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
5033171 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
5033172 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
5033173 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
5033174 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
5033175 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
5033176 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
5033177 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
5033178 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
5033179 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
5033180 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
5033181 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
5033182 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
5033183 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
5033184 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
5033185 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
5033186 these solutions are flexible the student will be moving a few times throughout college and you want something that can be adjusted to different places
5033187 we have in this country an overabundance of supply of health care services
5033188 so as we look to find ways to help stem the increase in cost associated with medical benefits we have to realize thats money coming out of revenue for a provider of care
5033189 the economic cost estimate to central new york for smoking is 763 million
5033190 individuals and society we can act on what we see in the mirror
5033191 you folks cant sustain that we cant as a community sustain that
5033192 i heard on the radio today that the soul put an end to the philly curse
5033193 your cars not starting right your battery may be going out
5033194 it was exciting game for fans some great attacking play some loose defending and a lot of goals i told the guys the result is the most important thing to come out of tonight and weve won so were top of the conference
5033195 i was looking forward to the rest to be honest weve played too many games and then youve got guys missing to injuries callups olympics we were down four or five guys during superliga
5033196 to have three of the five defensive minded players missing is a difficult thing dema kovalenko was missing and he may be one of the most important pieces missing tonight
5033197 we wanted to try to come out early and press them and get a goal early if we could and that happened
5033198 i thought yura and robbie started out great its been a long time coming for yura
5033199 where wasnt the problem from myself all the way out we just werent sharp i wasnt communicating well with the defense and we werent making the right decisions as a core group
5033200 i saw mullan made a great run from his side to the middle its my job just to get the ball behind the defense and he can run onto it luckily nate was aware that if he touches it the refs going to raise his flag so he did well on that part
5033201 findley gives teams problems hes got pace and he makes good runs thats going to give any team problems the second goal was a clearance that hit one of our guys and they pounced on it
5033202 i think thats really the first loose game our team has been a part of we were really loose defensively and we havent been for a long time
5033203 we know if we get down one goal if we just stick to our game plan and have faith in our guys and keep playing eventually were going to come back and create chances and now were starting to score a lot of goals things are starting to click
5033204 ive been waiting for that one for a while i was in the right place at the right time and it just happened to go in it was a big goal because it got us the lead
5033205 we had a good buildup brad played a good ball in and brian had great awareness to find me there
5033206 its houston in august like good luck i dont even know if you should be allowed to play in this heat
5033207 it was a great ball and i think i got a little too far in front of it i think i could have done better with it
5033208 the third goal was them just trying to pump the ball in the box the ball bounces their way and theyre on top of it
5033209 we probably could have scored more goals especially in the second half we kept them hanging around and then it made the game difficult
5033210 if you keep working hard and playing the way we were playing when we werent getting results we think the results will turn in our favor and thats happened right now we are scoring goals were creating more opportunities

5033229 na trama as irm s sempre dizem que ela a mais parecida com laura por isso tento representar essa certa afli o da ot via esse medo intr nseco da loucura
5033230 acho que o fato de ela crescer vendo laura pintar lhe despertou o interesse mas procuro fazer algo meio visceral para parecer com a laura que usa a arte como v lvula de escape
5033231 tive de trabalhar esse lado sensual da ot via com cuidado para n o ficar vulgar escolhi colocar um pouco de frieza junto com gestos impulsivos
5033232 observei como eram as festas daquela poca essa coisa do rocknroll das meninas quererem aprontar
5033233 a brenda lee minha personagem em bang bang novela de m rio prata tinha certa possibilidade de aprontar j que vivia em um bordel mas faltou esse toque apimentado do meu papel atual
5033234 a personagem b rbara tinha muito de parecido comigo daquela hist ria da garota do interior que vai para a capital em busca de seus sonhos
5033235 estou interpretando tanto esse lado louco que at acredito que ot via v ficar mesmo louca ou sozinha
5033236 no interior o mundo da tev praticamente inacess vel muito distante ningu m acha que sobreviver com arte muito menos que conseguir sair do interior e se destacar em uma metr pole
5033237 como eu j estava em s o paulo mesmo fui fazer teatro com o wolf maia depois passei para a oficina de atores na globo aqui no rio descobri que gosto de atuar
5033238 j pensei em cursar filosofia psicologia ou astronomia e at mesmo veterin ria por que n o enquanto n o me decido vou fazendo cursos na minha rea mesmo
5033239 fazer a ot via foi uma oportunidade para descobrir mais a respeito de mim mesma como atriz j que o papel me permite arriscar ser meio m e sem car ter e algu m tem de aprontar ali n
5033240 no rio convivi com muitos vegetarianos eu n o conseguiria comer s saladas
5033241 acho que essa coisa de falar e fazer antes de pensar que a ot via tem muito parecido comigo a quando voc pensa j fez
5033242 while watching the olympics opening night ceremonies i was delighted to see that printing was highlighted as one of ancient chinas four great inventions
5033243 we consider dip pen nanolithography which is nanotechnologys version of the quill pen and now polymer pen lithography to be two of northwesterns most important inventions
5033244 we can go in a sense from an ultra fine point sharpie to one with a fat tip
5033245 the tip of each polymer pen starts with nanometer scale sharpness but if we press down harder the tip flattens out this gives us great flexibility in the structures we can produce
5033246 s es cierto dell me tiene que entregar un notebook a un precio irrisorio porque yo como t pico vivo chileno estoy intentando aprovecharme hasta el m ximo que se pueda soy un sinverg enza y nada m s que eso
5033247 oh exijo mi notebook porque las empresas abusadoras alg n d a tienen que perder siempre se hacen ricas a costillas m as la ley me defiende y los 20 notebooks que compr me corresponden legitimamente
5033248 s lo nos gusta ver el lado bonito de la buena fe cuando se trata de la empresas y cada cosa que haga la empresa es un acto de mala fe terrible de un dolo imperdonable pero cuando se trata de los pobres consumidores cada vez que pasa algo es un atropello a nuestros derechos al querer comprar algo cual blancas palomas
5033249 de una vez por todas aprovecharse de estas malignas empresas que durante tantos a os nos han perjudicado
5033250 ante el precio resultante y ofrecido l gicamente que habr a adquirido uno o dos modelos
5033251 para cuando cada vez que vea una oferta y la compre tendre que pensarlo mas de 2 veces ya que hay una posibilidad real que el precio que vea solo sea un error del sistema
5033252 si no nos pasan los computadores a 77 lucas quiere decir que una vez m s las empresas pisotean a los consumidores

5033256 despite much progress over the past decade with 1 9 million fewer smokers since 1998 smoking is still the biggest killer in england
5033257 smoking related disease kills 87 000 people a year almost the equivalent to the entire population of towns such as ashford dover or tonbridge and malling
5033258 we want to know what people in kent think about these new proposals
5033259 one year on from the introduction of the smoking ban in public places these new proposals aim to take things one step further do people agree or disagree

5033265 we had a phone call from st john ambulance about 2 45am
5033266 they phoned back and said things are not so good so we need to have it happen now
5033267 if you had a four wheel drive and you knew how to use it you were all right
5033268 one of the hairier moments was stopping on the hill next to these cars to check if anyone was inside and hoping the car wouldnt slide backwards
5033269 they had good quality sleeping bags theyd settled down for the night
5033270 its a good illustration that down here we rely a lot on teamwork
5033271 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5033272 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5033273 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5033274 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5033275 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5033276 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others

5033279 we deserve nothing we earn nothing good karma is best achieved through humility
5033280 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5033281 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5033282 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5033283 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5033284 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5033285 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5033286 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
5033287 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
5033288 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
5033289 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
5033290 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
5033291 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
5033292 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5033293 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5033294 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5033295 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5033296 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5033297 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5033298 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5033299 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5033300 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5033301 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5033302 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5033303 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5033304 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5033305 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5033306 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5033307 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5033308 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5033309 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5033310 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5033311 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5033312 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5033313 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5033314 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5033315 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5033316 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5033317 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5033318 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5033319 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5033320 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5033321 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5033322 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5033323 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5033324 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5033325 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5033326 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5033327 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5033328 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5033329 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5033330 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5033331 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5033332 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5033333 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5033334 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5033335 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5033336 u s stocks with a good representation of smaller growth companies
5033337 for most people i recommend broad based total stock market index funds rather than individual stocks for portfolio formation
5033338 then there are small cap value index funds and large cap growth funds

5033347 the express delivery members account for four per cent of the total tonnage of shipments at the klia but pay 26 per cent of fcz charges
5033348 the fees imposed today are not in exchange for any goods or services provided in addition the determination of the fee structure is arbitrary and non transparent
5033349 since overall movement of shipments by express carriers differs from freight fowarders the fcz fee of rm5 is not fair and burdensome to the express delivery industry
5033350 the ministry of finance must make a decision whether it is fair and will benefit the business community freight fowarders express carriers and free zone authority not just the free zone authority
5033351 freight forwarders who form an integral part of the supply chain and constitute 99 per cent of all shipments cleared within the country have been left out
5033352 the owners of the goods or shipments are the importers themselves and they should also be held accountable for any smuggling or under declaration and not the forwarding agent who only acts on instructions and declares as per the attached commercial invoice
5033353 prices have come down so so fast from us 1 200 to us 800 a tonne in 45 days defaults are bound to happen

5033357 but in my view your face is not everything real beauty lies inside a person not outside
5033358 because beauty is all about faces and beautiful girls and skin
5033359 help us bring back a smile to the face of these survivors
5033360 they say that when we come to a beauty salon we come with the expectation that were going to be relaxed in a different frame of mind
5033361 if we come here and we see someone who has gone through so much pain and misery so automatically that gives us that low feeling also they have a point
5033362 once we had a wedding in the family i went there and all the girls were getting dressed and putting on makeup so that time i felt a pain in my heart
5033363 but i dont want to weaken myself with these thoughts
5033364 the peace of mind i have now i never had before i suffered much more mental anguish in my married life
5033365 i feel that her hands call me again and again
5033366 when i see them i want to be like them strong girls
5033367 i want to make a name for myself in this profession
5033368 he played very well but he had some thing with his ankle and it was impossible to continue scolari told sky sports now we have to send a letter and to discuss ballack with oliver bierhoff and joachim low germany coach and the national team from germany because its impossible for the doctor to say that it is a problem or not for the future we hope that next wednesday or next sunday hes in condition to play but i think its difficult
5033369 the creature at your feet dismissed as a bug or a weed is a creation in and of itself it has a name a million year history and a place in the world its genome adapts it to a special niche in an ecosystem the ethical value substantiated by close examination of its biology is that the life forms around us are too old too complex and potentially too useful to be carelessly discarded

5033373 no we cant reissue tickets here were not allowed to touch them youll have to have the redco ticket counter change them
5033374 we cant and we actually staff the redco ticket counter they cant reissue them but they should be able to issue new tickets if you call your company

5033392 poets priests and politicians have words to thank for their positions
5033393 we live in an age of mass production of narratives the prophecy of the european thinkers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries prescribing a paradigm for the creation of narrative has become a reality the result of the mass production of narratives is the leveling of all narratives posing a challenge to authority one grand narrative after another is discarded leaving the european mind longing for a unifying narrative that crystallizes the european identity

5033398 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
5033399 clearly were disappointed that unite here local 681 has spent more time protesting
5033400 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
5033401 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
5033402 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
5033403 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
5033404 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care
5033405 we do remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement thats both fair and equitable providing that union leadership is reasonable and realistic in its approach

5033411 i will take a look at the market value of my condo and consider the possibility of selling at a loss thanks for your input
5033412 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
5033413 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
5033414 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
5033415 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
5033416 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
5033417 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
5033418 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
5033419 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
5033420 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
5033421 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
5033422 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
5033423 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
5033424 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
5033425 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
5033426 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
5033427 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
5033428 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
5033429 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
5033430 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm

5033436 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
5033437 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
5033438 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
5033439 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
5033440 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
5033441 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
5033442 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
5033443 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
5033444 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
5033445 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
5033446 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves

5033453 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
5033454 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics

5033457 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
5033458 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
5033459 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

5033470 i always wondered whether sometime a political protester would hit me with a pie in the face i never thought a friendly birthday cake would attack me from the rear

5033472 education funding is very important part of our economy has to be based on attracting and keeping good paying jobs and we cant do that without a well educated work force

5033475 can you provide any documentation or evidence of your claim that two different securities which attempt to track the same index will not cause an investor to run afoul of the wash sale rule
5033476 tax courts have ruled that if you swap the securities of one company for the securities of an unrelated company then the securities are not identical and a tax loss is allowed therefore swapping a vanguard mutual fund for a schwab mutual fund should not create a tax wash lets apply the same precedence to index funds if you sold the vanguard 500 fund at a loss and simultaneously purchased the schwab s amp p 500 index fund for the same amount in my opinion a legitimate tax loss in created
5033477 theres some debate but no direct authority on the question of whether two mutual funds keying off the same index are substantially identical for purposes of the wash sale rule can you sell one s amp p 500 index fund at a loss and buy a different s amp p 500 fund the same day without having a wash sale because there is no direct authority dealing with this question reasonable minds may disagree its always possible to identify differences between funds managed by different companies such as expense ratios and tax load some people conclude on this basis that funds maintained by two different companies are never substantially identical my feeling is that those differences arent enough to prevent the two funds from being substantially identical the point of the wash sale rule is to determine whether youve changed your position relative to the market if you can lay the price graph for your new investment on top of the price graph for the old one and never see a significant disparity as would be the case for two high quality s amp p 500 funds the investments should be considered substantially identical for purposes of the wash sale rule
5033478 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
5033479 a couple of u s stock funds or even just one a total stock market index fund plus a foreign stock fund and a bond fund are all most people need to cover the bases
5033480 if you have more then eight funds you should slap yourself
5033481 how many funds should you have four to six should do
5033482 as a general rule of thumb the more complexity that exists in a wall street cration the faster and farther investors should run
5033483 it does not take much to outperform the average investor all you have to do is put half your money in the vangurd total stock market and the other half in an intermediate term bond fund

5033502 they cant run me out of this church no matter how hard they try and that sense of inclusion that you feel when you are with other catholics and with people who have been raised in the same way and have the same like mindedness and sense of love and giving is very strong

5033542 the lower manhattan initiative is expected to be in place by 2010

5033552 unlike mark spitz who was known for playing mind games with his teammates phelps appears to be well liked many of them lauded him throughout the competition even when he had beaten them badly in his individual races
5033553 some of the greatest memories from meets like this are the times spent with teammates
5033554 there were a lot of rookies on the mens team some of them i didnt really know as well as others playing spades playing risk relaxing and getting to know everyone on the team being part of team usa and the olympic team is one of the greatest memories i will take from this

5033565 i knew that prilukov could catch me because he did in the 400 freestyle
5033566 we started with everything we could in the first 500 to get ourselves into the race essentially through the middle its a dogfight and everybody wants a piece of it
5033567 we knew that we had a really solid 500 and it was just a matter of not waiting for it but going everyone together we closed our eyes and went for it
5033568 we had to find a little something extra to get beyond them
5033569 our goal was to have a really solid first 1 500 in our previous races weve gotten caught a few times we really wanted to put together a solid last 500

5033585 non sono caduto in miseria e non son mai stato in miseria sappi che vengo dai samana presso i quali sono vissuto per molto tempo
5033586 se vieni dai samana come fai a non essere in miseria non vivono i samana in assoluta poverta
5033587 non possiedo niente se questo che tu intendi dire certamente son povero ma lo sono volontariamente quindi non sono in miseria
5033588 non ci ho mai pensato signore per pi di tre anni sono vissuto nella pi assoluta povert e non ho mai pensato di che potessi vivere
5033589 probabilmente cos anche il mercante vive dei beni degli altri
5033590 ben detto ma egli non prende la roba agli altri per nulla d in cambio la propria merce
5033591 cos pare difatti che stia la cosa ognuno prende ognuno d cos la vita

5033594 that pissed me off i was hearing it so much this year and ive heard it asked of me and other drivers in years before especially since the chase
5033595 in a way i feel like the media knows that every guy gets up in the morning and goes to win the race but to enable them to write their story about the chase whoever its about or whatever its about they have to point out that wins are more important because of the bonus system and all that
5033596 hes asking me if i realize how important the bonus points are
5033597 remember when randy moss said he takes some plays off years ago

5033600 if its a dear diary types endeavor then it doesnt make sense making it public does it

5033603 when you have a hot flame sitting next to you any movie will be amazing
5033604 kalau hendak muzakarah juga kita tanya mereka sebab apa tidak mahu menerima islam dalam semua aspek kehidupan termasuk ekonomi dan budaya kita kena tanya mereka di mana tidak kena islam sehingga umno tidak mahu menerimanya
5033605 hanya ini sahaja yang boleh kalau kita hendak muzakarah dengan umno
5033606 saya hendak tanya siapa yang tidak berikan kalau tidak umno yang sejak dari dahulu lagi tidak mahu orang ramai mendengar ceramah agama
5033607 jadi buat apa kita hendak berunding juga dengan mereka yang tidak mahu membenarkan orang ramai mendengar ceramah agama
5033608 saya pun hairan satu pihak hendak berunding dengan umno dan satu pihak lagi hendak perkukuhkan pakatan rakyat macam mana boleh berlaku sedemikian ini menggelirukan orang ramai
5033609 kalau umno tiada di muka dunia ini orang melayu pun tidak rosak di lima negeri yang dikuasai pakatan rakyat sekarang orang melayu pun boleh hidup juga
5033610 kalau kita sayangkan umno kita keluarkan mereka daripada kegelapan yang tua tua itu biarlah sudah payah begitu juga mereka yang mempunyai duit banyak biarlah
5033611 seperti juga kita payah hendak tebang pokok besar kecuali dengan cara kita buangkan dahulu ranting dahannya dan lama kelamaan pokok besar itu akan mati juga
5033612 cuma kita tumpulah kepada golongan muda dengan mengajak mereka kepada islam
5033613 sukar untuk menerangkan perkara itu kepada ahli dan juga orang umno yang menyokong pas
5033614 saya hendak tanya pkr jumpa ahli parlimen sabah dan sarawak adakah telah dibincangkan dalam pakatan
5033615 adakah kemasukan 30 ahli parlimen itu akan menguntungkan orang melayu dan agama islam
5033616 pendekatan menghukum menyebabkan orang menjadi takut tetapi jika pendekatan dakwah insya allah orang akan mengikut kita
5033617 kita memberi jaminan bahawa semua perkara dirujuk kepada parti dan kalau perlu muktamar khas diadakan untuk mendapat kata putus mengenai perkara tersebut
5033618 orang tidak boleh menggunakan masalah peribadi untuk berkempen tetapi kena lawan dasar antara pas dan umno
5033619 yang bawa cerita sumpah pada hari penamaan calon apa dia tidak ada cara lain lagi untuk berkempen
5033620 sumpah seperti itu letak kitab atas tangan adalah meniru amalan orang kristian ini karut
5033621 saya nak jumpa supaya umno tidak terus menerima islam separuh sahaja kerana jika umno tidak ada islam menjadi lebih baik di bawah pas
5033622 kerana muzakarah bukan hendak membincangkan mengenai kerusi atau kementerian tetapi bagaimana hendak berdepan allah di hari akhirat kelak

5033625 just something so ordinary about it so no nonsense and no pretense about it
5033626 lo m s preocupante es la subida del componente subyacente sobre todo porque en un contexto de d bil crecimiento una espiral alcista de precios puede ser un escollo para el conjunto de la econom a y sobre todo para el mbito empresarial
5033627 la subida de la inflaci n subyacente es el peor aspecto porque es un riesgo que apunta a efectos de segunda vuelta pero sigo pensando que la bajada del componente energ tico desde los pr ximos meses y la debilidad de la demanda har que ese repunte subyacente no se consolide
5033628 en nuestras previsiones esperamos que inflaci n alcance su m ximo en agosto del 5 4 por ciento y baje al 4 3 por ciento 4 4 por ciento en los tres ltimos meses
5033629 el aspecto positivo de esto es que probablemente hemos llegado al techo del a o y a partir de aqu cabe esperar una reducci n de la tasa interanual
5033630 indicamos desde hace cierto tiempo que los fundamentos del mercado se distienden
5033631 mucha gente fue sorprendida por la amplitud de la bajada de los precios del petr leo
5033632 los hechos en el c ucaso crean tambi n amenazas
5033633 muestra que esta regi n crucial para transportar petr leo del mar caspio hacia los mercados consumidores sigue siendo muy vol til
5033634 es una verg enza que tantas corporaciones obtengan cuantiosos beneficios y nada paguen para sostener a nuestro pa s
5033635 la mitad de todos los ingresos empresariales en estados unidos terminan pasando ahora por el c digo de los ingresos de las personas f sicas
5033636 ha llegado el momento de que las grandes corporaciones paguen sus justas cargas
5033637 la recuperaci n del d lar estadounidense y la correcci n de los precios del petr leo desencadenaron la liquidaci n de las posiciones de oro
5033638 asistimos a un movimiento general de correcci n en los mercados de materias primas
5033639 en el contexto actual de crisis de liquidez y de dificultades en otros mercados las instituciones financieras y los particulares necesitan dinero se embolsan los beneficios donde pueden
5033640 la necesidad de liquidez gana sobre las tensiones geopol ticas
5033641 aunque el fortalecimiento de la moneda estadounidense no juega a favor del oro pensamos que el contexto macroecon mico general la desaceleraci n del crecimiento conducir a a los compradores al mercado m s tarde en el a o

5033644 there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future

5033647 que bien que civilizado es viene de los pueblos originarios pero entiende la modernizaci n del estado
5033648 existe una complicada problem tica que data de hace siglos en donde no se valora a las mujeres y se les condena a ser objetos tiene que difundirse dice que se trata de un delito y las autoridades como los ciudadanos deben estar informados de esto
5033649 no se considera a las mujeres como seres humanos hay sitios donde no las dejan ni hablar y menos ejercer su derecho a votar
5033650 el esp ritu de la cedaw tiene como objetivos fundamentales reafirmar la fe en los derechos humanos fundamentales en la dignidad y el valor de la persona y en la igualdad de los derechos de hombres y mujeres
5033651 los ejes centrales son los derechos civiles y la condici n jur dica y social de la mujer los derechos relacionados con la reproducci n humana y con las consecuencias de los factores culturales en la dignidad y el valor de la persona y en la igualdad de los derechos de hombres y mujeres
5033652 este flagelo que adem s de presentar un desaf o a los gobiernos significa una grave amenaza a la convivencia arm nica de los gobiernos significa una grave amenaza a la convivencia arm nica de los pueblos y constituye un brutal ataque a la libertad y a la dignidad de los seres humanos
5033653 had you asked me and some of my colleagues a few years ago we would have said you would have an ice free arctic ocean anywhere from 2050 2070 to 2100 because this was pretty much what our climate models were forecasting
5033654 but we know were losing the ice a lot faster than any of these projections
5033655 there seems to be some aspects of this big loss that we still dont have a handle on some processes that are missing that we dont have a handle on so every time we look at the problem we keep revising our numbers earlier and earlier
5033656 my view is that 2013 or five years is just too aggressive
5033657 computer projections have consistently shown that as global temperatures rise the sea ice cover will begin to shrink while a number of natural factors have certainly contributed to the overall decline in sea ice the effects of greenhouse warming are now coming through loud and clear
5033658 there is nothing in the data to suggest anything but natural cycles at work as we can see from recent history both the extent and thickness of arctic sea ice is certainly subject to variation
5033659 but it would be a mistake to assume that a brief period during which the arctic is in a thinning cycle is anything more than that a cycle
5033660 i am amazed appalled and highly offended by it global warming it is a scam
5033661 there is no significant manmade global warming under way and the science on which the computer projections of weather chaos are based is badly flawed
5033662 the constant urgent message is that global warming is happening now and as the arctic ice cap melts the climate disaster is beginning to unfold before our eyes
5033663 the simple meteorological facts are that the melt happens every year
5033664 in the spring and summer some of the ice melts and in the fall and winter it reforms again
5033665 the problem with the naysayer arguments that this is just some natural cycle is that they refuse to understand that climate doesnt just doesnt change by itself
5033666 something has to force it we know whats forcing it
5033667 if they are to dismiss this huge body of evidence that were seeing clearly now in response to higher greenhouse gas concentration they have to come up with another mechanism
5033668 simply dismissing this as a natural cycle is a cop out
5033669 we know why were losing ice because its warming up the arctic like the rest of the globe is warming we always knew that the arctic would be the place that would be really sensitive to change thats where you see it first its just what were seeing its just that the pace of change is catching us by surprise
5033670 have shown the most rapid rates of warming in recent years the impacts of this climate change in the polar regions over the next 100 years will exceed the impacts forecast for many other regions and will produce feedbacks that will have globally significant consequences
5033671 the complexity of response in biological and human systems and the fact that these systems are subject to multiple stressors means that future impacts remain very difficult to predict
5033672 the growing recognition is that losing that ice cover can have impact on weather that extends well beyond the arctic
5033673 this is a line of inquiry that seems to be very much still very much in its infancy
5033674 the changes are happening almost too fast for us to keep up with what some of those implications could be were only just starting to learn
5033675 the rapid loss of sea ice can trigger widespread changes that would be felt across the region
5033676 recent observations of phenomena such as glacial retreats sea level rise and the migration of temperature sensitive species are not evidence for abnormal climate change for none of these changes has been shown to lie outside the bounds of known natural variability

5033723 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
5033724 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

5033761 young professionals across the nation conservation professionals park professionals have really stepped forward to honor the guys
5033762 i dont think were doing a very good job of telling that story
5033763 i always tell people there is no great value no great story in being poor this is in fact was a slice of history that was all about the economic status of a person there were no rich people in the ccc
5033764 they learned how to take care of themselves they learned a skill it could have been maybe mechanics love of nature and they learned discipline and they learned how to respect each other
5033765 at the time during the depression it was tough and my father was working for a company in waterbury and he was only working a couple days a week

5033776 we all wanted to see him in a different uniform a new place and to see how he reacted
5033777 very much in control of the huddle like he always is and very much in control of the game and that allowed us to be in control as an offense as a unit we felt like everything that we were going to run was going to work

5033804 it looks like a lewis hamilton victory in the formula one drivers championship is the only thing that can deny a british olympian the honour
5033805 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5033806 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5033807 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5033808 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

5033810 il piccolo cimitero per i bambini mai nati sar un posto dove le mamme andranno a pregare e servir da monito per quelle donne che pensano di togliere la vita al bambino che hanno in grembo
5033811 abbiamo letto proprio in questi giorni di amministrazioni comunali che stanziano dei fondi per i cimiteri degli animali
5033812 oggi andiamo verso la perdizione noi vogliamo essere custodi di valori fondamentali come quelli della vita e della famiglia non ci importa se siamo giudicati fuori dal tempo
5033813 per noi la vita intesa come inizio della fecondazione certo la questione annosa e irrisolta chiss quanti di questi bambini che non hanno mai visto la luce per scelta delle loro mamme sarebbero stati daccordo e comunque daccordo o meno con i nostri valori vogliamo solo dare una dignitosa sepoltura e un segno di solidariet a centinaia di donne che non hanno mai superato il trauma e chiedono una tomba su cui pregare

5033815 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5033816 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5033817 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5033818 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5033819 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5033820 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5033821 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5033822 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5033823 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5033824 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

5033826 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5033827 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5033828 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5033829 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5033830 mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused
5033831 lobbies regulatory agencies on alcohol issues that involve public health and safety
5033832 he doesnt listen carefully to people and make reasoned judgments
5033833 if john says im going with so and so you cant count on that the next morning
5033834 mccains personal fortune traces back to organized crime in arizona
5033835 the forecast is based on a number of factors most significantly economic growth in diverse areas of the world
5033836 the key thing is for all of us to work together this means the receivers the customs forwarding associations as well as the shipping lines working together to move containers in and out of the ports fast to eliminate congestion
5033837 that law is going to make a lot better for everyone because congestion costs money for everyone at the end of the day
5033838 yes three days shouldnt be an issue it just requires a positive outlook from everyone communication is the key
5033839 if we see our containers lying in ports factories or warehouses for long periods of time it means we are not being very efficient and it also means we are not being very efficient to our customers because we eventually have to pass the cost back to them

5033871 most of them havent had the chance to see the pyramids and the tombs because when they go back to egypt they stay only for a week to visit their families
5033872 to expect that all the world should and must adopt the pecular political institutions of the united states which often do not work very well even at home is to indulge in the most unrealistic of visions yet just that seems to be the hope and expectation of many neoconservatives such foreign policies are such stuff as dreams are made on yet they lead to the heaps of corpses of men who died in vain
5033873 can you at least have the doctor put in my iud my husband is like dying
5033874 he didnt need any meds he was the kind of kid who if someone had just threatened to call his mother he probably wouldve stopped what he was doing
5033875 i understand drugs for high blood pressure for diabetes but i know mikie and i didnt need emotional stabilizers to live our lives
5033876 the people who are most respected are the ones who talk to drug companies who become consultants for multiple companies because their opinion is really valued
5033877 we prescribe the medication that works best for the patient irrespective of our relationship with a drug company
5033878 if a physician talks to all the companies and prescribes for all the companies then no company has an edge
5033879 in order to ensure that the data procured is as reliable and accurate as possible
5033880 clinical research is a critical element in the development of revolutionary medicines that help patients live longer healthier lives
5033881 you could take statistics and bar charts and make them look pretty much how you wanted them to
5033882 i saw firsthand several circumstances where my minimization of side effects or misinforming a physician had actually resulted in the patient being damaged and or killed
5033883 it makes me wonder what real safeguards there are here to protect foster children in texas from being involved in clinical trials
5033884 whether any wrong is being done or not theres certainly the perception
5033885 but i dont sit there and think hey a concerta rep came in today
5033886 there is more data out for the newer drugs which makes doctors more likely to use them thats why it appears theres something unethical going on with the drug companies when theres not
5033887 he was given three times the amount given to adult patients each of these drugs was given to us by a child psychiatrist
5033888 he was supposed to be in state care but nobody was looking after evan but me
5033889 now my kids dont take medications i wont ever trust doctors again
5033890 the state takes a child that is upset crying yelling and screaming because theyve just been taken from their families and with all those symptoms prescribes them medication
5033891 they think that if the child is unruly its easier to deal with them by medicating them than by counseling
5033892 its a medical model we didnt have any other options
5033893 i always questioned if they didnt need them out there in the real world why do they need them in here but i wasnt about to go against the doctors orders
5033894 eu acho que n o podemos reclamar quase nada do nosso torcedor mas naturalmente o corintiano um pouco impaciente talvez um pouquinho em fun o dos ltimos tempos ent o quando a equipe n o faz o resultado com rapidez e isso aconteceu um pouco dentro de casa nas ltimas vezes que jogamos acontece a cobran a

5033896 foi meu primeiro gol no pacaembu diante da torcida e foi bom porque deu tranq ilidade para a equipe na partida
5033897 a gente fica feliz de ter terminado liderando o primeiro turno mas isso n o vale nada a gente tem que fazer no segundo turno o mesmo que fizemos no primeiro

5033928 to win the champions league the premier league we need more than this
5033929 i said to anelka today you have three or four chances and you have to make one or two goals for me and for the people because i want the people to believe in you
5033930 today they played very well its important but more important is that the fans of chelsea saw a beautiful game
5033931 i bought two strikers and maybe i made a rod for my own back because you cant play 4 4 2 here unless you play 4 5 1 you get overloaded theyre just too good
5033932 he should tender his resignation pack up his bags and go
5033933 whatever little moral authority was left has now been completely eroded
5033934 this thing must be clear to everyone that president musharraf is not going to resign period
5033935 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5033936 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5033937 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5033938 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5033939 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5033940 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5033941 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5033942 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5033943 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country

5034012 and i saw a great and wondrous sign in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars and she being with child cries travailing in birth and pained to be delivered and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born and she brought forth a man child who is to rule all the nations and the child was caught up unto god and to his throne and the woman fled into the wilderness where she hath the place prepared of god that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days and then when the dragon saw it he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child and to the woman were given two wings of the great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent and the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood and the earth helped the woman and opened her mouth and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth and the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the saints of her seed which keep the commandments of god and have the testimony of jesus

5034036 de plaat werkt als een nachtelijke trip van het dromerige soort
5034037 the record is like a trip through the night a dreamy one
5034038 youre the god of this city youre the king of these people youre hope for the hopeless youre light in the darkness there is no one like our god there is no one like our god greater things have yet to come greater things are still to be done in this city greater things have yet to come greater things are still to be done in this city there is no one like our god there is no one like our god
5034039 the race of legends is a highly thrilling event so adding a current f1 driver like timo glock to the mix allows fans to witness a variety of skills of some of the top drivers in the world both past and present
5034040 its a great pleasure for fans and enthusiasts to see their heroes still racing at the highest levels as we saw out here today they remain as competitive as ever
5034041 an event like the monterey historics is an enthusiasts dream you can see people licking their chops when they walk around
5034042 to be here and to listen to the roar of the engines on all these race cars makes my heart skip a beat
5034043 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5034044 inner core shear wave anisotropy and texture from an observation of pkjkp waves
5034045 since the discovery of the earths core a century ago and the subsequent discovery of a solid inner core postulated to have formed by the freezing of iron seismologists have striven to understand this most remote part of the deep earth
5034046 the most direct evidence for a solid inner core would be the observation of shear mode body waves that traverse it but these phases are extremely difficult to observe two reported observations in short period data have proved controversial arguably more successful have been studies of longer period data but such averaging limits the usefulness of the observations to reported sightings
5034047 it is a speck of the dust that cloaks mars such dust particles color the martian sky pink feed storms that regularly envelop the planet and produce mars distinctive red soil
5034048 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5034049 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5034050 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5034051 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5034052 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5034053 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5034054 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5034055 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5034056 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5034057 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5034058 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5034059 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5034060 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5034061 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5034062 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5034063 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5034064 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5034065 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5034066 who are open to doing something on the production side
5034067 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5034068 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5034069 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5034070 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5034071 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5034072 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5034073 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5034074 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5034075 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

5034109 hoy chile est conforme con su statu quo territorial y no tiene reclamaciones pendientes con sus vecinos por lo tanto su gran objetivo no es ofensivo sino defensivo para materializar su defensa ha escogido una estrategia disuasiva

5034131 first and second is great for peugeot and it was an open fight so its very nice to win like that
5034132 we are fighting closely with the no1 audi so we know we are at a good level
5034133 but unfortunately the audi is not at the same level as the peugeot
5034134 we will keep fighting for the championship for as long as we can win it but it is going to be difficult
5034135 the new prime minister yousuf raza gilani who was in washington this week to meet president bush says he is doing his best to convince his country that this is pakistans war but he seems not to have won the argument within his own government
5034136 this complex situation calls for a careful and flexible response from the united states and to its credit the outgoing bush administration is making a relatively good start at fashioning that response
5034137 gillani on his first official us visit since being elected in february was left in no doubt that the bush administration had lost patience with the isis alleged double game
5034138 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5034139 the fact that we have young people over there who have u s passports is of tremendous concern because of their ability to come back into the united states
5034140 we have previously said that increased activity in the pakistani tribal areas gives us some reason for concern
5034141 we have also previously talked about our concerns that al qaida is seeking to recruit western looking sympathizers with no criminal records who could more easily blend in and attempt to travel to the united states
5034142 no credible information at this time to suggest an imminent threat to the homeland or u s interests at the olympics
5034143 i understand there is a problem of extremism at some madrassas
5034144 but to put everyone under this broad net of suspicion is beginning to infringe on peoples civil liberties
5034145 michael mccauls failed publicity stunt shows it is past time for new leadership in texas 10th congressional district
5034146 a nice sound bite that trivializes a very serious issue for this country
5034147 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5034148 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
5034149 it was sort of this aha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof
5034150 and asked about leaked information that tipped militants to surveillance efforts by western intelligence services
5034151 thats probably something the government of pakistan ought to speak to
5034152 we and some of our allies have evidence not only from the scene of the explosion but evidence beyond it that unfortunately indicate a hand like that
5034153 we are fairly confident of what you are talking about
5034154 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5034155 strong evidence and circumstantial evidence of american acquiescence to terrorism inside pakistan
5034156 carrying what were seen as india influenced intelligence inputs had hardened the resolve of pakistans security establishment to keep supreme pakistans national security interest even if it meant straining ties with the us and nato
5034157 not to distinguish between a terrorist for the united states and afghanistan and a terrorist for pakistan
5034158 for reasons best known to langley the cia headquarters as well as the pentagon pakistani officials say the americans were not interested in disrupting the kabul based fountainhead of terrorism in balochistan nor do they want to allocate the marvellous predator unmanned armed aerial combat vehicle resource to neutralise the kingpin of suicide bombings against the pakistani military establishment now hiding near the pakistan afghan border
5034159 pakistans enemy number one and the mastermind of almost every suicide operation against the pakistan army and the isi since june 2006
5034160 the united states military has the capacity to direct a missile to a precise location at very short notice as it has done close to 20 times in the last few years to hit al qaeda targets inside pakistan
5034161 have long been intrigued by the presence of highly encrypted communications gear with mehsud this communication gear enables him to collect real time information on pakistani troop movements from an unidentified foreign source without being intercepted by pakistani intelligence
5034162 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5034163 there is a cold war between india and pakistan they say hands off kashmir we say hands off afghanistan
5034164 there is just enough pakistan co operation with the us to get away with it
5034165 but the us agenda is not innocent either they desire a larger role for themselves in the muslim world
5034166 the isi is going to determine the destiny of pakistan perhaps in the near future
5034167 during the afghan jihad so many things were created by pakistan now these elements are out of control
5034168 the indian statement is not only surprising but shocking too
5034169 some rogue elements in the isi are working against the interest of the country they are being funded by a terror sponsor state the us
5034170 anytime the supreme court called the interior ministry or the defense ministry they could not get the isi into the court
5034171 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5034172 we have received information that nearly 800 militants are waiting to cross over to india at the borders
5034173 the wired fencing at border areas is being further strengthened
5034174 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5034175 mullah rahmatullah tried to show that the afghan government is weak in kandahar
5034176 after the arrest mullah rahmatullah confessed to his crimes and said he received orders and money for all terroristic activities and for the kidnappings from one of the members of pakistans consulate in kandahar
5034177 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5034178 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5034179 what the deputies committee has raised is given the possibility that political fragmentation in pakistan is going to continue do we need to change our strategy
5034180 the argument that we may destabilize pakistan has taken us to where we are right now
5034181 pursuing the policy of public praise and private pressure on pakistan doesnt work
5034182 we need to enhance the capacity of hitting these targets
5034183 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5034184 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
5034185 the only result of the use of airstrikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism
5034186 abandon the idea that the afghan government will be under its control
5034187 we do not want to be the slaves or puppets of other countries
5034188 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5034189 you are butchers liars and hypocrites you keep on talking about terrorism to the media but behind closed doors you support terrorism
5034190 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5034191 this particular air force exercise is important because india is included among some very important allies
5034192 this is definitely an extension of an arc that has been mapped out since 2000 and it really signifies that what india and the united states have is a strategic relationship
5034193 the united states is very keen that india become important
5034194 indias going to be doing what it wants to do in the area that china thinks is important and a more capable strong india will be able to prevent chinese hegemony more so than a weak india
5034195 we will learn how our allies operate in response to similar threats
5034196 it will allow us to build observations to eventually learn those lessons about what it takes to integrate talk fly with employ deploy and sustain air power with places like india korea and france
5034197 pyongyang through its state run news agency the korean central news agency has consistently and passionately criticized such ventures accusing the united states of harboring hostile intentions toward north korea
5034198 beijing would likely remain reticent about such training since it does not see itself as directly and imminently affected by such activities
5034199 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5034200 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
5034201 the only result of the use of airstrikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism
5034202 abandon the idea that the afghan government will be under its control
5034203 we do not want to be the slaves or puppets of other countries
5034204 this is not true we have no reports of missiles being fired into pakistan
5034205 it is not clear whether wazir survived the attack or not but his brother abdur rehman and one of their close relatives abdul salam were killed in the strike
5034206 they were three men who suddenly stood up during the meeting and one of them opened fire on him
5034207 if these kinds of operations continue against us in swat and in the tribal areas we will continue this
5034208 it is our firm resolve that we will root out terrorism from pakistan and all of our security agencies are working together to achieve this goal
5034209 reiterated the resolve of the nation to remain determined and not yield to pressures created by such heinous crimes
5034210 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5034211 were being told by western envoys that its not going to bring more stability to have a long trial and that it is in the interests of stability for him to exit
5034212 we are very clear that we have no role to play in this impeachment process britain has no interest in talking about the fate of individuals
5034213 there is a link between musharraf and the army so humiliating him is like humiliating the army
5034214 the us administration would have much preferred to see a workable political arrangement between musharraf and the government not another looming transition
5034215 whoever abrogates the constitution must be punished or we will never stop these dictators usurping power here
5034216 this is a man who stood up against al qaida who will face al qaida after musharraf certainly not this coalition
5034217 the anti terrorist squad of uttar pradesh has arrested one isi agent of pakistan from rupaideeha in bahraich district we have come to know that his name is mohamad masrur alias manzoor ansari who is son of noor muhammad he is native of 154 4 garden west adul jabbar compound near nazeer hotel karachi
5034218 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5034219 extremists wanted to establish their hold in bajaur and the government had to take action
5034220 until today 462 militants have been killed in bajaur and a similar number have been injured twenty two troops have been killed and some are missing in action
5034221 were approaching a pull the plug kind of decision this is like a last stand for webcasting were losing money as it is the moment we think this problem in washington is not going to get solved we have to pull the plug because all were doing is wasting money were funded by venture capital theyre not going to chase a company whose business model has been broken so if it doesnt feel like its headed towards a solution were done

5034225 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5034226 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5034227 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5034228 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5034229 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5034230 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5034231 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5034232 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5034233 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5034234 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5034235 it is one of the biggest liabilities of the tournament for us if bolt runs a record well be running for the hills
5034236 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5034237 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5034238 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5034239 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5034240 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5034241 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5034242 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5034243 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5034244 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5034245 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5034246 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5034247 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5034248 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5034249 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5034250 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5034251 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5034252 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5034253 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5034254 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5034255 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5034256 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

5034280 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5034281 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 per cent wide open
5034282 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5034283 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5034284 we historically dont make our decisions within a 24 hour period it takes time to get everybody in a group and talk about it
5034285 j d was just going to go back and discuss things with his team he was apologetic for what happened to put everyone in this situation
5034286 ruski tenkovi na ulicama gruzijskih gradova podsje aju nas na invaziju 1968 godine ali to nije samo povijest i dalje ak i sada pitanje ho emo li ili ne emo pripadati ruskoj sferi utjecaja ostaje relevantno
5034287 i learned a lot about processing and how the industry operated
5034288 i was instrumental in guiding them through a tough time they were having with a management group in 1999 and with a few friends assisted them to overcome a very perilous situation it was then and there that i realized what i was truly good at which is solving other companies problems i learned a lot at epoch they taught me a lot about this space and a lot about third party billing
5034289 i then engaged with new frontier media a public adult company in colorado and guided them through a tricky transition from a billing standpoint it was interesting to learn how a public company operates and i experienced a lot
5034290 i received some of the greatest guidance regarding this industry from flash cash
5034291 they are a smart group of people and run their business very well i am happy to have worked with them so closely
5034292 that is a true testament to listening and then providing solutions to the problems of your clients
5034293 charles truly had a superior product when i met him in phoenix
5034294 his particular challenge was that people had been burned by other traffic offerings in the past he needed a recognized and trusted entity to deliver his message and thats where i came in
5034295 i am very proud of my relationship to wildline they are a quality company run by a very talented and creative hands on president and they will do very well as they continue to grow
5034296 anything i can do to be of assistance to joan i am happy to do it
5034297 we as an industry owe her a lot and she deserves all of our respect and assistance in any way we can provide it
5034298 i believe that companies who provide solid service are worthwhile to everyone in this space and most importantly to the space itself i intend to make sure i do what i can to increase the longevity and growth potential of the online adult entertainment space in a safe and thoughtful manner

5034313 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5034314 he explained he is pro choice but not pro abortion and that he thinks women dont make the decision to have an abortion casually and wrestle with it

5034318 i dont think ill be there you dont even know your way to the post office
5034319 ask for the reason for the hope that is in us
5034320 good teacher what must i do to inherit eternal life
5034321 one thing you still lack sell all that you have and distribute to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven and come follow me
5034322 you have answered correctly do this and you will live
5034323 when the son of man comes will he find faith on the earth
5034324 i tell you that this man went down to his home justified rather than the pharisee
5034325 i tell you the truth whoever does not receive the kingdom of god like a child will never enter it
5034326 i have wholeheartedly obeyed all of these laws since my youth
5034327 sell all that you have and give the money to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven here is the test
5034328 let go of your desire to have a boyfriend right now and follow me
5034329 keep your clothes on and your eyes pure and follow me
5034330 believe that i can change your spouse you forgive him or her and follow me
5034331 if you wish to gain your life you must lose it but whoever loses his life will keep it
5034332 youre right you are allowed one carry on bag but im supposed to check its contents before letting it through
5034333 it was far less about religion and a lot more about values
5034334 on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception and you are consistent then i cant argue with you on that
5034335 what i can do is say are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
5034336 for me as a christian it is a sacred union gods in the mix
5034337 i can afford those civil rights to others even if i dont have that view
5034338 i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5034339 john mccains going to be a much tougher opponent for barack obama in the debates than anybody ever might have imagined just a few weeks ago
5034340 for a minute there we were just two christians worshipping together
5034341 i thought barack obamas answer tonight was helpful to him and addressed a couple of things because theres been a lot of doubt about his christian faith
5034342 i think he also helped to dispel the myth that hes such an elitist and hes arrogant he was quite humble in that answer and many others
5034343 i was so obsessed with me and the reasons i might be dissatisfied i couldnt focus on other people
5034344 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
5034345 i dont think he was a strong enough jurist or a legal thinker at the time for that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation
5034346 this nomination should be based on the criteria of a proven record of strictly adhering to the constitution and not legislating from the bench
5034347 mit tony und seinen leuten zu sprechen schien mir die beste entscheidung aus den richtigen gr nden zu sein
5034348 es ist eine tolle gelegenheit denn ich sch tze tony sowohl von einem pers nlichen gesichtspunkt heraus als nat rlich auch vom fahrerischen her
5034349 tony hat dies als fahrer und als teamchef bereits bewiesen er ist ein rennfahrer der alle facetten des sports kennt er wei was zum sieg n tig ist und ich wei dass er mir all das geben wird um erfolgreich zu sein
5034350 wir teilen die gleichen ziele den gleichen background und die gleiche einstellung

5034355 her new effort appears to be just another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices
5034356 there was a crisp immediate forceful response by john mccain clearly in a comfort zone because he was with his base
5034357 sooner or later our president is going to say or do something that goes too far and then it will start
5034358 what happened here in the last week certainly came as a shock not only to georgia but to a lot of others as well
5034359 a lot of people will as a result of this want to build a closer relationship with their western partners as quickly as possible
5034360 i would like to believe it will be russia because we are fraternal nations and have to support each other
5034361 russia will not disappear tomorrow as well as in a century or two
5034362 we will always wake up and it will be there not canada

5034401 fuerte incremento de las denuncias de hombres lo que demuestra que la v ctima no siempre es la mujer
5034402 herir al hombre en su integridad ps quica en diferentes modalidades como por ejemplo en su sexualidad su profesionalidad su trabajo en casa o su val a
5034403 otra de las formas de maltrato m s habituales contra los hombres
5034404 de forma fraudulenta a la hora de denunciar a su pareja por malos tratos en detrimento del hombre
5034405 cuando hay nimo de venganza o de ganar el m ximo de beneficios con el divorcio y de la forma m s r pida a trav s de los denominados
5034406 marginan brutalmente al hombre al ser el m s perjudicado ya que es quien se queda sin casa paga pensiones muy altas y no ve a sus hijos
5034407 hacen falta medidas de prevenci n de educaci n y de intervenci n preventiva y terap utica si se quiere acabar con la violencia dom stica
5034408 condenar con prisi n las denuncias falsas de malos tratos
5034409 existe un porcentaje de mujeres que se aprovecha de esta protecci n mediante denuncias falsas
5034410 las que realmente est n viviendo los malos tratos no est n siendo o das por lo que se esta produciendo una desproporci n tremenda
5034411 no es cuesti n de g nero sino que realmente la violencia corresponde al que es violento y no a un g nero determinado
5034412 porque todav a siguen con mucho complejo pero en lo que no hay duda es que el maltrato no tiene ni pantalones ni faldas
5034413 retroceso que ahora se mezclara un fen meno social como es el maltrato hacia las mujeres con lo que puede ser una an cdota personal es decir el maltrato a algunos hombres
5034414 existir n casos individuales de violencia dom stica en el que alguna mujer por circunstancias personales puede aprovecharse de una posici n dominante para ejercer alg n tipo de maltrato al hombre pero son casos individuales y no un problema social

5034416 we hope our republican colleagues will join in a bipartisan effort not only to increase domestic supply but also to help consumers and to protect the environment
5034417 if speaker pelosi and her democratic colleagues were truly serious about increasing production of american energy and lowering the price of gasoline they would call congress back into session immediately to vote on our all of the above energy plan rather than taking a five week break away from washington
5034418 another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices
5034419 we are going to put them to the test on this issue
5034420 during the past eight years our energy policy has been directed by the two oilmen in the white house
5034421 their failed policy has increased our dependence on foreign oil damaged our economy and left consumers paying record prices at the pump

5034430 each bin costs 550 a year to be emptied if they have to be emptied more often that penalises everyone else
5034431 with petrol at around 2 a litre its probably costing them more than it would to buy a rubbish bag
5034432 we dont blame the council they have been very good and are doing all that they can
5034433 the city is simply too small to support and sustain two full service private hospitals
5034434 at least one of the two hospitals most likely southern cross will shut down of its own accord
5034435 in essence no provincial centre in new zealand has been able to sustain more than one private surgical hospital and palmerston north is no exception

5034463 last years seniors had such high expectations so it was kind of a disappointing year
5034464 all the classes were separate last year and i think that was a big part of why the season fell apart
5034465 this year were pulling together as a team were more like a family weve learned from our mistakes last year
5034466 theres not a position on the field where a guy shouldnt be looking behind him we tell these guys that our job is to put the best 11 guys on the field so that we can win right now
5034467 in two years theyre going to win it for sure
5034468 the younger guys on this team all work hard and they all know what they are doing they are going to be great and im planning on coming back to watch them
5034469 ive been in the weight room nearly every day to make sure this is a good season for them
5034470 all the seniors we have were sophomores that played varsity at one time so they know how tough it is for us now they are the leaders and someday well be in their positions trying to help the younger guys on the team

5034476 i wont be the lonely one sitting on my own and sad a 50 year old reminiscing what i had
5034477 if you believe all that you also have to believe you were rubbish five months ago when nobody cared
5034478 i just wanted to express ideas and be sincere as long as it was real to me why these themes i dont really know why to be honest you dont think that far down the line that people are even going to hear these songs
5034479 and when youre not very numb the downfall is youre too sensitive to human things certain things are just so heartbreaking they stay in my mind and i cant shake them off the hurt the fear or the euphoria and so you sit down with a guitar and it pours out of your brain

5034490 there are definitely frustrations in the youth which have been in our culture for quite a while but no matter how many times you read about it it strikes you with total shock the lack of humanity or like i say in ice cream van the albums closing hymnal which sounds like the requiem mass for morality itself pure community freedom of faith act of citizenship yknow theres actually saying grow a heart man how could you actually harm another person whats happening to us man

5034512 every day i think i had it for breakfast the other day
5034513 i get so tired and i dont feel like eating any of the other dishes i eat some duck drink some rice porridge and take off
5034514 the famed beijing duck is a hot gold medal contender for the most popular food in the host city of the ongoing olympic games
5034515 the skin is very thin and very crispy their sauce is not too salty or too sweet one bite and the oily duck juice spurts into your mouth
5034516 its the best representation of our country you have to climb the great wall you have to go to a hutong traditional alleyway you have to buy silk and you have to eat peking roast duck
5034517 its the most authentic its taste is different from all the others

5034528 i know everyone likes to make fun of kevin keegan but he engineered a pretty good finish to the season for newcastle united and the additions of jonas gutierrez and fabricio coloccini arent insignificant why cant newcastle assuming they dont sell milner and keegan doesnt walk out make a run at a top six finish
5034529 i see why ferguson doesnt want to sell fraizer campbell
5034530 what is it about scoring a goal that causes teams to switch off
5034531 everton yesterday and newcastle today each score and then concede within a minute
5034532 dont you think its a bit unfair to be referring to them manchester as united and us newcastle as newcastle
5034533 i think it would be fair to give both their proper titles there are two uniteds playing today
5034534 i have recently taken to wasting an inordinate amount of time playing football manager 2007
5034535 can anyone recommend any players who turn out to be wonderkids so i can get on with making bradford european champions
5034536 rather than whipping out his spiderman mask from his y fronts when he scores do you think gutierrez has considered the advantage that might be gained from keeping it on throughout the entire match it would probably contravene some premier league guideline article xi players shall not intimate fictional superheroes while the ball is in play and it might obscure visibility somewhat but think of the bemusement value for opposition defenders
5034537 it was three agbonlahor goals in about six minutes for that 4 1 lead
5034538 i noticed the manchester players are wearing black arm bands do you know why
5034539 the commentators on the us feed im watching havent mentioned anything
5034540 re stephen forsters two uniteds point at 40mins to be fair newcastle fans chant newcastle themselves united dont sing manchester when referring to themselves because we have another team called manchester
5034541 although newcastle fans could just be referring to their home town and not their club anyway happy to have cleared that up for you
5034542 is frazier campbell a good player or not and if so how good is shay given the best goalie in the premier league
5034543 although newcastle fans do sing newcastle they also chant united so im not sure steve hewitt has cleared anything up
5034544 re your given remains an excellent shot stopper though petr cech his blips last season notwithstanding has to be the best premier league keeper thats like saying im the best premier league player apart from the slight lack of pace power control goals and the fact that i am eight time zones away in malaysia
5034545 is this respect thing working or is everyone on best behaviour on the first day back at school there seems to be few cards about even paul scholes hasnt added to his vast collection

5034548 in less than three years the value of gold has more than doubled now selling for more than 900 an ounce chanel must have noticed how much people have been lovin on gold lately because both of their upcoming fall and holiday makeup collections go after gold in a mad crazy way
5034549 when it came time in the class to apply my lip color one of the makeup artists ceremoniously presented me with a nude lip liner dual ended pencil gazing intensely into my eyes with the seriousness of an initiate in a cult
5034550 did you know chanel provides free makeup classes for customers the sessions are called chanel master classes and i went to my very first one last saturday at my neighborhood macys store
5034551 the collection just arrived at chanel counters nationwide i fell in love with five of the products in this release two of the glossimers delight and gold light facettes dor highlighter in gold fever and two of the lipsticks pepeete and formentera
5034552 even though coco mademoiselle is in the oriental fragrance family it doesnt smell stuffy or old lady at all its youthful and sophisticated you wont smell like an old lady who lunches and totes small terrier dogs in burberry outfits you will smell like a confident young woman strutting down the street in a classic black suit
5034553 heres the lip look im wearing this morning done with chanel papeete aqualumiere lipstick and gold light glossimer from the fall 2008 collection what do you think fun and sparkly
5034554 the sparkle factor is high on these glosses its very grown up glitter though i love looking at the color and seeing the different flecks of gold silver pink and green glossimers are thick but arent as sticky as mac lipglass you can still feel them on your lip unlike thin lipglosses

5034561 we talk about poverty in africa but theres poverty here in invercargill theres people that really need money from the government
5034562 i dont think i have a staunch allegiance to a party
5034563 they need to look more like people and less like politicians
5034564 i think its a good concept but the way they did it and the way people are using it they havent done it properly
5034565 many people i know only vote because of the leader of the party

5034569 we feel the same things at the same time we start singing the same lines from the same songs at exactly the same time without any prompting and we always know what each other is feeling and going to say or do next when i was 11 i fell through a window and badly cut my arm
5034570 at exactly that point even though we werent together sophie started to feel really unwell
5034571 it is weird but i guess we are used to it so dont notice it as much as everyone else
5034572 we didnt do any of that swapping boyfriends or playing tricks on restaurant customers thing we never thought we would get away with it
5034573 even though weve only played four gigs with the band we are starting to get noticed
5034574 we are still trying to find our sound and are quite experimental but we both seem to know exactly which harmony to sing at which point even though it may be the first time weve sung a particular track
5034575 when people talk about experience what they really want to know is does he have good judgment you would hope that if someone has more experience it gives them better judgment but everyone knows many 50 60 and 70 year olds who dont have good judgment because they keep making the same mistakes over and over again what we want to talk about is judgement common sense and how we get stuff done
5034576 commission to assess the threat to the united states from electromagnetic pulse attack
5034577 a single nuclear weapon exploded at high altitude above the united states will interact with the earths atmosphere ionosphere and magnetic field to produce electromagnetic pulse emp radiation down to the earth and additionally create electrical currents in the earth emp effects are both direct and indirect the former are due to electrical systems and the latter arise from the damage that shocked upset damaged and destroyed electronics controls then inflict on the systems in which they are embedded the indirect effects can be even more severe than the direct effects
5034578 the major impact of emp weapons is on electronics so pervasive in all aspects of our society and military coupled through critical infrastructures their effects on systems and infrastructures dependent on electricity and electronics could be sufficiently ruinous as to qualify as catastrophic to the nation
5034579 i mean think about it iran cuba venezuela these countries are tiny compared to the soviet union they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us you know iran they spend one one hundredth of what we spend on the military if iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance
5034580 when a country doesnt recognize the individual rights of its own citizens it cannot claim any national or international rights therefore anyone who wants to invade a dictatorship or semi dictatorship is morally justified in doing so because he is doing no worse than what that country has accepted as its social system it is improper to attack a free country because it recognizes the individual rights of its citizens

5034585 none of us know the circumstances under which the police felt threatened to the point of repeatedly using the taser
5034586 ill side with the police officers judgement on whether the force used was necessary 100 times out of 100
5034587 repeated prolonged and or continuous exposures to the taser may impair breathing and respiration particularly when the probes are placed across the chest or diaphragm
5034588 and you know its sad its so many incidents in south florida with these tasers
5034589 the story linked to doesnt say anything to indicate improper behaviour by police
5034590 they tased him three different times they just kept tasing him i told the police youre going to kill that man so after they did it a third time i just walked away
5034591 and they just start tasing him and tasing him until they killed him and you know its sad its so many incidents in south florida with these tasers trigger happy tasers and theyre killing people and they try to justify it

5034598 a brain tumor the best thing that ever happened to me
5034599 i quit watching the news on tv in the morning i prefer reading the news on your website why start the day with negative information when you can start it with positive information it really has improved my attitude towards everyday life im in a good mood after reading the news on your website everyday people need to learn to focus on the postive rather than the negative theres so much good in this world
5034600 thank you for writing your newsletter some good news i enjoyed reading the positive stories i am heartened by thegoodness and generosity that i see in people keep up your good work
5034601 when the war in iraq started i went into a depression state i feltconstantly worried and agitated and it was hard to enjoy doing things iloved to do then i found your site it lifted my spirits and helped get me out ofthe funk i was in now im going to school and enjoying the things ilike to do whenever i feel depressed i visit your site
5034602 when i get to work in the morning iget my coffee jump online and read the news every day i went home sadand depressed then i found your site and after reading the first storyi immediately felt my spirits lift i never went home sad again reading ordinary news gives us a sense that thats all there is butyour site reminds us that there is more and the world is not as bad asthe news would lead us to believe thank you for everything
5034603 i wont ever date you cos i dont want to hurt you

5034606 eine mannschaft die schwer zu spielen aber zu packen ist
5034607 i think its a beautiful thing that 13 years later shes even more powerful as far as her name and her music just carrying on and that i think is a beautiful thing a lot of children come here to the museum that werent even born when selena was alive and they speak of her as if they know her and that comes from their parents in a weird kind of way its a little southing to my soul to know that she is not going to be forgotten as a person and also as an artist
5034608 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
5034609 from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings for courtenay so did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing but eventually she just gave in and at every party theyd kiss and touch each other in the corner its a miracle nobody found out both of them would do lines of cocaine in the toilets then head home and fall into bed together
5034610 back then samantha and lindsay didnt have a physical relationship she once said samanthas the father i never had apparently samantha acted in a paternal way towards her giving her advice and cuddles
5034611 courtenay would throw fits of rage writing her hundreds of angry e mails from another room in the house the sexual attraction between them was electric though and theyd still kiss and make up
5034612 courtenay still cant understand how lindsay is now so open with samantha every time she sees a picture of them together it kills her
5034613 my bottom line is that those taking antidepressants with highly depressed mood do perform significantly worse than a control group
5034614 would you really want to have brain surgery done by someone who is really depressed or would you rather have them on an antidepressant or no medication at all
5034615 ich war vom freitagstraining her zuversichtlich denn wir haben nach dem warmup etwas umgestellt dadurch war ich in einigen passagen schneller unterwegs
5034616 nach zwei runden wurde mir klar dass mein motorrad sehr flott war
5034617 am start verlor ich eine halbe sekunde als ich von hopkins berholt wurde casey war da unglaublich schnell als w re er schon zehn runden unterwegs ich machte mir sorgen aber nach zwei runden wurde mir klar dass mein motorrad sehr flott war ich kam n her an das rote bike heran und stellte mich schon auf einen harten zweikampf ein als er pl tzlich seinen fehler machte ich konnte es kaum glauben denn das machte es mir deutlich einfacher
5034618 hatte ich einfach freude am fahren meine reifen hielten locker durch und meine m1 f hlte sich sehr gut an nat rlich z hlt dieser sieg f r mich nicht voll weil casey ausgeschieden ist das tut mir leid f r ihn aber thats racing die punkte nehme ich gerne nun haben wir 50 punkte vorsprung was schon eine ganze menge ist trotzdem kann es noch eng werden wenn der gegner so stark ist wie casey wir werden uns nicht zur cklehnen
5034619 wir m ssen so weitermachen und d rfen die konzentration nicht verlieren wir hatten aber zwei sehr gute rennen und sind in sehr guter verfassung
5034620 jetzt gehen wir zwei tage testen das ist sehr wichtig f r die restlichen sechs rennen gerade beim heimrennen in misano wollen wir die scharte vom vorjahr ausmerzen
5034621 das rennen lief nicht ganz gl cklich f r mich denn wir hatten das potential daf r deutlich besser abzuschneiden
5034622 wenn man aber in betracht zieht was an diesem wochenende schon alles vor sich gegangen ist und wenn man die probleme mit den vorderreifen ber cksichtigt dann haben wir wohl das bestm gliche getan ich wollte am start nicht zu viele risiken eingehen und f hlte dass der frontreifen mit jeder runde schlechter wurde
5034623 der hinterreifen wurde immer besser ich wei dass wir diese probleme schon das ganze wochenende ber mit uns herumgeschleppt haben aber michelin arbeitet hart an einer l sung wir werden den test also daf r nutzen einige verbesserungen zu finden ich muss mich bei meinem team f r die geleistete arbeit bedanken valentino zu seinem sieg gratulieren und auch toni elias zu seinem podium
5034624 wir h tten kaum besser sein k nnen aber mit dem zehnten platz kann man nicht zufrieden sein im gro en und ganzen hat jorge einen guten job gemacht und ist ein gutes rennen gefahren er fand im mittleren rennabschnitt einen guten rhythmus konnte diesen bis zum schluss halten und einige fahrer berholen au erdem hat er punkte geholt die motivation ist nach wie vor hoch denn es liegen noch viele rennen vor uns
5034625 die fehler die man macht werden in der bundesliga gnadenlos abgestraft
5034626 die niederlage ist hart aber auf der art und weise k nnen wir aufbauen
5034627 wir haben unsere chancen genutzt mit der ersten halbzeit kann man zufrieden sein
5034628 wir haben uns mehr vorgenommen und leider nicht im richtigen moment das tor gemacht
5034629 dont hang off the balcony my dog has no nose
5034630 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5034631 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 per cent wide open
5034632 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5034633 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5034634 we historically dont make our decisions within a 24 hour period it takes time to get everybody in a group and talk about it
5034635 we want the complete truth about abu ghraib to be told the world must know what happened
5034636 caci has repeatedly made and continues to make knowingly false statements to the effect that none of its employees was involved in torturing prisoners in fact co conspirators have admitted that big steve and several other corporate employees were involved in the torture
5034637 contrary to the revisionist history some are propagating the defendants are not victims of anything when it comes to abu ghraib no pseudo patriotic book campaign will change that fact the real victims the people who were senselessly tortured and are now pursuing legal claims just as americans rightly would if they or their families suffered these abuses look forward to having their day in court
5034638 private military contractors cant act with impunity outside the law they have to be held accountable for their participation in the atrocities at abu ghraib and the other facilities we believe what they and their employees did clearly violated the geneva conventions the army field manual and the laws of the united states
5034639 this lawsuit represents another voice for the innocent victims of abu ghraib but also for decent people throughout the world who decry torture mr al janabi and others like him have suffered enough they deserve the right to hold the defendants accountable for their conduct

5034645 the begging mafia is the biggest problem says jose maveli president of the janaseva sishu bhavan in aluva keralas largest charitable rehabilitation centres for children picked off the streets or handed by the police courts and ngos
5034646 sometime ago we trailed a racketeer in thrissur driving around in his big car with his staff collecting the days proceeds from children he had left to beg in the town but these days the mafia mostly lie low
5034647 what are you trying to do hang me or something
5034648 ive never really been on the pill so when my husband and i decided we wanted to have kids several years ago i thought it would just be a matter of time in fact i remember how a close friend and i both decided to start trying at the same time
5034649 wouldnt it be lovely to announce our big news next time were home at christmas new year diwali xs wedding
5034650 i wanted a child not a pregnancy so i decided to adopt
5034651 thanks for the reviews sharon is right about searching for comedy in the muslim world it was a total disaster the muslim world in india and the protagonists narcissistic stupidity is only matched by the total unfunniness of the dialogue plot and situations
5034652 i think it has a lot to do with london this last time i returned to visit london it struck me as a discourteous unpleasant city this is definitely not the vibe one gets in say wash dc and its not the same as say life in cambridge uk sad to say though the english are not as open by far as americans for all their faults americans are more open and less distant and yes less snotty
5034653 finally youre back i was wondering what you were doing all this time eh well ive been meaning to formally interview my dad about his family history for ages my grandfather was involved in congress and then switched sides to the muslim league when he was convinced by jinnahs arguments and even spent some time in jail but i havent gotten around to it yet me well you know my history sorry about the job but glad you got a break
5034654 what would papa have done im not sure how papa would have reacted maybe this she scorned at the lawn then jotted down the infringement she was no longer scornful but she liked to scorn before she took breakfast she drove on while the scorn percolated through her it felt good she drove through the avenues past the fronds of bananas and palms the trees were dessicated someone else had infringed while she foraged for her pen a second time she knew today would be a day of scorn

5034673 desde el momento en que la mir supe que era alguien especial
5034674 la noche del 14 de julio la recordar toda mi vida no por lo que pas sino por lo que signific para m
5034675 all of the young men were able to get out of jena high and go to other schools and they have succeeded
5034676 the main thing these children needed to make the transition from high school to adulthood was a supporting environment canterbury is an incredible opportunity and jesse ray knows it
5034677 we have great confidence that its going to work out
5034678 that will determine to a large extent how a person comes out of a high profile situation
5034679 on some level kids are more accepting and understanding and they wanted to weigh all the issues while many adults come to quick conclusions
5034680 we look at all the factors not just the legal result because society has a certain belief system and values
5034681 the six jena students who became enraged about the nooses and beat up someone has great historical meaning compared to someone who beats up someone else for some drugs
5034682 how people handle race and their deep ingrained beliefs will play a factor in how they respond to this situation to some extent its about violence but its still about race and how were a divided society
5034683 i will never condone violence on any level but you can understand how something like this could happen when this symbol was used to frighten
5034684 just because we dont condone it violence doesnt mean we shouldnt help people understand it if you use the n word or a noose its a powerful provocative act
5034685 a bunch of people are crocheting at school you should try it its fun
5034686 but i think we should teach women in uganda to crochet
5034687 sewing is already a competitive trade if we teach them to crochet for a living it will give them a marketable skill that sets them apart
5034688 the world and most zimbabweans pray for a free and fair election not marred by violence and intimidation as in the past
5034689 we urge the sadc observers to produce a report characterised by integrity and honestly we have let down the suffering people of zimbabwe for too long already they deserve better
5034690 since the runoff was announced the violence in zimbabwe has gotten even worse zimbabweans cant vote freely if they fear their vote may get them killed
5034691 johannesburg a two day summit of southern african development community sadc leaders ended sunday in johannesburg without achieving a much hoped for power sharing deal between zimbabwean president robert mugabe and opposition leader morgan tsvangirai
5034692 but to no avail as the cause now is as just as it was then and the same spirit is in todays republicans as was present in eamonn ceannt and his comrades
5034693 for blogs with substantive content and deemed useful to those searching for information
5034694 strip searches in armagh jail from women behind the wire magazine 1984
5034695 hopefully the process is to spot things that would be grist for the funny mill
5034696 in some respects the heavier subjects are the ones that are most loaded with opportunity because they have the most you know the difference between potential and kinetic energy they have the most potential energy so to delve into that gives you the largest combustion the most interest i dont mean for the audience i mean for us everyone here is working too hard to do stuff we dont care about
5034697 may be exaggerated on the show its grounded in the way jon really feels
5034698 all these data points of spin and transparent falsehoods dished out in the form of political discourse
5034699 fish from that what is the true meaning what are red herrings false leads
5034700 we often discuss satire the sort of thing he does and to a certain extent i do as distillery
5034701 you have an enormous amount of material and you have to distill it to a syrup by the end of the day so much of it is a hewing process chipping away at things that arent the point or arent the story or arent the intention really its that last couple of drops youre distilling that makes all the difference it isnt that hard to get a ton of corn into a gallon of sour mash but to get that gallon of sour mash down to that one shot of pure whiskey takes patience
5034702 would be very unpleasant for most people to watch its really a gathering of curmudgeons expressing frustration and upset and the rest of the day is spent trying to mask or repress that through whatever creative devices we can find
5034703 those types of stories that can almost like the guy in the green mile
5034704 suck in all the toxins and allow you to do something with it that is palatable
5034705 money is important in life it does not give you happiness we all know but it sure calms the nerves
5034706 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
5034707 for the past two years crude has followed the dollar almost lock step
5034708 the strength weve seen in the dollar is almost certainly helping bring crude down at this point as you move backward it actually acts as a stimulus on the economy
5034709 it was a horrible thing you could hear them screaming but there was nothing you could do
5034710 she tried to put the water hose on it to do what we could do but by that time it was too late
5034711 it was too much fire the water hose wouldnt do nothing
5034712 it burned so quick and there was so much fire
5034713 we feel it and we are very disappointed because that makes a shadow on the olympics definitely
5034714 because they china are the host of games the country is changing politically the doors have begun to open
5034715 i dont know anyone out there who would get tired of playing with venus williams
5034716 we were really focused from the first point we really wanted to win
5034717 we feel like weve contributed to our country in a huge way thats really what its all about
5034718 during the olympic games we fought really hard and we want to show this sichuan spirit that we are brave

5034726 auntie has cancer that means shes going to die right
5034727 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5034728 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5034729 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5034730 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5034731 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5034732 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5034733 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5034736 im sorry miss we dont have any ketchup in the restaurant but if youd like i could check if we have any roasted tomato puree or tomato confit
5034737 grief is so private but you want to be there out of respect
5034738 even with her charges we are not feeling anything bad about tressy she has been through so much
5034739 i dont want people to forget what happened to donna and darrell and the people that they were
5034740 one of our first priorities is protecting our own soil and i think mccain will do that
5034741 national security is the priority over all these issues we have in the country
5034742 hes much more appealing when it comes to a brighter outlook and a better attitude
5034743 its infectious you finally have someone whos out there trying to pump you up and say good things
5034744 you have a number of democrats who are unsure about obama for a variety of reasons his race may be part of it also that hes new on the scene and there are all these rumors that are going around
5034745 the expected track and timing would yield significant widespread rainfall across the area late next week
5034746 at times traffic would get heavy because they were blocking everybody off
5034747 im surprised its a little bit late for a trade
5034748 but for me i passed my best times in this organization
5034749 sometimes guys just have off years i think that happens its a part of the game hes certainly healthy and i think a change of scenery will help him
5034750 i think going to a pennant race will help him
5034751 i cant say enough good things about luis he took the ball for us anytime he was asked and did a phenomenal job his entire career hell be missed
5034752 theyre fighting for first place so im going to do my best to clear my mind and try to help the bullpen
5034753 he attacked the hitters i kind of expect the same thing plus hes experienced thats important
5034754 he had requested to be traded this year throughout the year
5034755 we attempted to do so by the trade deadline and just were not able to make a deal that made sense for us with a month and a half left before free agency we felt we needed to get something for him
5034756 un asilo de eeuu a musharraf no est en discusi n

5034759 oh by the way i posted my first diary earlier
5034760 deus disp s os membros colocando cada um deles no corpo como lhe aprouve
5034761 i do not think i am being pessimistic more realistic when i say spurs may have trouble keeping fifth spot
5034762 to be a top four team you have to play in the ugly games and win
5034763 si dejamos de lado los detalles y los remilgos a que obligan sus buenos modales ese
5034764 tener imagen motivos y programa no bastan para ser candidato todav a se requiere tener apoyos org nicos y esa es la cuesti n por diversos motivos su intelectualismo su delectaci n por la liturgia c vica su desprecio del latinoamericanismo los partidos se le resisten

5034766 this is the first drug of its kind in the world and the implications are enormous
5034767 if this comes to fruition and were confident with the results so far it would be up there with the cervical cancer vaccine gardasil even bigger
5034768 it would be the biggest blockbuster since blood pressure lowering drugs
5034769 this would basically mean taking one tablet a day rather than requiring eight hours of dialysis every few days
5034770 creates an empty space where your creativity can reassert itself
5034771 i begin each day of my life with a ritual i wake up at 5 30 a m put on my work out clothes my leg warmers my sweatshirts and my hat i walk outside my manhattan home hail a taxi and tell the driver to take me to the pumping iron gym at 91 st street and first avenue where i work out for two hours the ritual is not the stretching and weight training i put my body through each morning the ritual is the cab the moment i tell the driver where to go i have completed the ritual
5034772 religion is regarded by the common people as true by the wise as false and by the ruler as useful
5034773 why not give him batsman out lbw to a ball not pitched between wicket and wicket providing he makes no attempt to hit the ball this would be a great encouragement to the leg spinner
5034774 those who claim recent events may have rectified the trouble may well be right in the short term but in 10 20 years it would certainly return and be a bogey once more and i think our responsibility is to provide now against such a contingency
5034775 but i think it germane to say that throwing has been a recurring evil for nearly 100 years and if modern legislators can devise ways and means of curing this evil once and for all they will do cricket a great service
5034776 there is no doubt the packer protagonists are cleverly using the press for propaganda purposes
5034777 i would not willingly support any move to have government interference in tv rights which may control packer because as i have said many times before it would inevitably bring control of the fees that might be paid
5034778 the subject is so political that i cant see us playing in south africa we have the problem of our govt the unions and the demos
5034779 i think you will get a good and sympathetic hearing from the cricket fraternity in london but what use is that if the powers that be wont let tours take place
5034780 the media and a large chunk of the public including some of johns supporters still question whether hes told the whole truth
5034781 happy to take a paternity test and would love to see it happen
5034782 anybody whos been around campaigns knows that folks come and go
5034783 i would only have positive things to say about him as being a helpful friendly and pleasant co worker to a new employee
5034784 if the supply of homes is increasing and the sales are declining theres only one place price can go
5034785 if the supply of homes is increasing and the sales are declining theres only one place price can go
5034786 these creditors certainly their counsel have to know that they will never collect so much as 35 from mike nifong
5034787 we knew there were risks because this is a species that is extremely susceptible to problems under anesthesia
5034788 it was a calculated risk that we had to take
5034789 i am confident that none of the documents have been released
5034790 i was shocked that something like this would occur i never dreamed it would i deeply regret that this happened
5034791 well i would but its gonna be a lot quicker if i just go in this one
5034792 i would go in the 10 items queue if i had 10 items but i dont i dont
5034793 it will be a landmark by election it will be a deciding factor for anwar
5034794 i am touched by the overwhelming support it is no longer just a by election it is a lot more than that
5034795 it is a historic moment for malaysians especially the silent majority to convey how they want the nation to move ahead
5034796 that is what he is crying for we cannot ignore that
5034797 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
5034798 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5034799 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it
5034800 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
5034801 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states
5034802 i think its the responsibility of the vice president if youre unwilling or unable to do that then i think you should defer to someone else
5034803 geeez im tired of all these bands that sound like conor oberst
5034804 within 24 hours either a bagman will come with our winnings or well be asked to leave our dues with the local chai wallah
5034805 i know industrialists and politicians who will risk millions of rupees on one over since the match fixing scandals of the 1990s the business has become more complex and sophisticated
5034806 odds are relayed via a live service which bookies subscribe to
5034807 the whole thing is very secretive even the big bookies never meet the really big fish face to face they say only a handful of people at the top mastermind everything
5034808 we are constantly moving around nowadays there are certain officers who are after us
5034809 no i pay large bribes to many police officers and politicians
5034810 it is very difficult to talk to players and each game is closely scrutinised
5034811 with that kind of insider knowledge they can manipulate the odds and make a killing
5034812 the criminal nexus that controls gambling has become very adept at influencing the results to its own advantage
5034813 there are certain players in certain teams who are open to bribery blackmail and coercion
5034814 ibrahim is involved in drugs weapons counterfeiting and contract killings
5034815 the odds suddenly look too enticing you notice it a lot when pakistan or the west indians are playing many of their players are definitely for sale
5034816 my wife didnt want me going to the west indies
5034817 tell them to look up tell them to remember the stars
5034818 another fine slice of indie pop brilliance to grace my speakers as i go a little crazy on my office dance floor with a whiff of morrissey two dashes of guillemots and a sprinkle of rumble got one hell of a sonic cocktail here
5034819 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5034820 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
5034821 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
5034822 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
5034823 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5034824 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5034825 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5034826 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
5034827 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
5034828 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5034829 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5034830 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5034831 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5034832 para m fue un gran impacto pero debo decir que soy el nico responsable del positivo de daniela
5034833 siempre procur comprar medicamentos de laboratorios conocidos para su recuperaci n f sica pero durante el ltimo verano compr algunos art culos medicinales en grecia y turqu a y lo m s probable es que fueran los que causaron el problema obviamente consumi suplementos alimenticios contaminados
5034834 pensaba en retirarme despu s de los juegos de pek n pero ser a una pena hacerlo en estas cirucunstancias es una situaci n muy dif cil y necesitar tiempo para darme cuenta de lo que pas
5034835 ha sido la peor carrera de mi vida la m s no se puede llegar a decir ni que haya corrido una carrera he pensado en meterme en el box he estado a punto pero pod a coger un punto
5034836 yo soy una persona muy vergonzosa pero nunca en mi vida hab a sentido tanta verg enza la gente de michelin no reconoce los errores adem s son arrogantes hacen ver como si tampoco fuera tan malo eso es lo peor de todo
5034837 ha sido la peor carrera de mi vida la m s no se puede llegar a decir ni que haya corrido una carrera he pensado en meterme en el box he estado a punto pero pod a coger un punto
5034838 he salido bien he intentado mantenerme en la primera vuelta pero en la segunda de seguida se me ha empezado a ir mucho la moto de delante a la que intentaba forzar y ya iba con cuidado para no caerme ha habido una vuelta que he estado a punto de caerme dos veces y he intento llevar un ritmo m s lento pero era imposible
5034839 para colmo he empezado a tener problemas con el neum tico de atr s y al final iba con tiempos de las motos de 250 cc muy despacio ha sido muy vergonzoso tener que pilotar de esa manera no s lo que sienten en el equipo para m hoy no he corrido he dado unas vueltas un paseo
5034840 lo primero es volver a motivarme y seguir hay que intentar no perder la ilusi n en las cosas antes de venir al gran premio los propios de michelin ya te dijeron bueno los entrenos no fueron muy bien aqu ya no llegas con la ilusi n que deber a ser
5034841 creo que el mundial est perdido con el error de stoner rossi no debe tener ninguna presi n aunque alg n d a quedemos por delante de l
5034842 lo importante cuando uno se equivoca es afrontarlo ponerte cara a cara y decir no lo hice bien esto es lo mejor que uno puede hacer ponerse de cara al problema y apartarlo de delante esta es la nica opci n que tengo
5034843 el error no es ni de honda ni de dani pedrosa el error es de quien hace los neum ticos que no los hace bien ese es el error si los neum ticos fueran competitivos en todas las carreras no habr a ning n problema
5034844 try it out right now we wont mind if we see you texting

5034846 im just going to ride tomorrow like its any other race

5034848 the track is rough and there are a lot of different lines

5034857 por que em agosto de 1968 o ocidente deveria sair em defesa de alguns idealistas que queriam reformar o comunismo contra a hegemonia sovi tica

5034860 politicians try to express a view out of the mainstream their words are pounced on and quoted out of context by hostile media and political opponents now it seems politicians must feel obliged to dissociate themselves from reports published by independent bodies which they have not commissioned and whose authors may not even belong to their political party
5034861 it was kalams counsel that inspired me to take the final decision i would have committed a historic blunder had i not entered politics

5034865 the afghan government is involved in protecting the opium trade by shielding it from american designed policies while it is true that karzais taliban enemies finance themselves from the drug trade so do many of his supporters he is not going to let the narco trade disappear
5034866 the cost to society of illicit drug abuse alone is 181 billion annually

5034881 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
5034882 back in the day we had some creative control over our own individual characters we were allowed to develop our own personalities and our own style and thats what made everybody unique and different
5034883 it would be very hard for me for somebody to hand me a written script as to what they think my character might say no matter how good they may be or how talented they might be at what theyre doing i dont think i would have succeeded in that environment i just needed to know when i did an interview what were the bullet points then i would put on my thinking cap and try to think of a new approach something to make my interview different from everybody elses and different from my last interview
5034884 the little small fiefdoms couldnt flourish anymore because everybody was seeing what everybody else was doing with cable television
5034885 part of the problem with world championship wrestling was you had non wrestling people who didnt understand the product trying to compete with a company that was headed by a third generation family in the wrestling business and understood the core product even though the wcw was beating them in the ratings the wwf was still remaining profitable with pay per view it was really a situation where they just gave wcw enough time to create their own demise and thats really what happened
5034886 its like a minor league baseball team you can have a beautiful park some outstanding players and a great product that youre putting on the field but the perception is that its still the minor leagues and the big show is over here and everybody is going to see the disparity between the two i dont think theres any way that the minor league team can elevate themselves to the place where theyre seen at the same level
5034887 the original horsemen will always be special to me because they were what started it all and it wasnt molded creatively it was an impromptu thing the fans really made it happen and it was because of the uniqueness of the talent
5034888 but in terms of the in ring product and the capability of the type of matches about the third time through when barry windham was there was the best in ring product because barry had everything barry was young tall good looking had an amazing athleticism could really do anything in the ring and would have made a great world champion so thats my favorite group in terms of what could happen in the ring
5034889 without so much as an introduction the much talked about opening shot establishes carlos reygadass silent light stellet licht as more of a transcendental contemplation elevated by a pantheistic evaluation than a high art austere glorification whatever you call the mexicans third feature it requires nothing but patience and an open mind for as rewarding as it may be its virtues are matched by a test of endurance

5034893 you are correct in identifying the shrinking of humanitarian space and the problems of confusions between the military and humanitarian purposes of foreigners who are here
5034894 the international rescue committee is firmly committed to protecting humanitarian space and distinguishing humanitarian workers from any military employees
5034895 i think it is important that the worlds oldest democracy must stand with one of the newest when its been illegally invaded by another country
5034896 as a determined determinist i would say that yes you bet an experimenters choice what to measure was fixed from the dawn of time and so were the properties of the thing he decided to call a photon
5034897 if you believe in determinism you have to believe it all the way no escape possible conway and kochen have shown here in a beautiful way that a half hearted belief in pseudo determinism is impossible to sustain

5034904 i dont know what happened i cant explain what happened here this afternoon
5034905 i had done that exercise 15 or 20 times and everything had always gone well
5034906 i never imagined this could happen to me that is a routine ive been doing for years and it never went wrong
5034907 i am very sorry brazilians i should have won a medal
5034908 two days ago he successfully did that same routine during a training session so we decided to try it here
5034909 the heroes are less likely to provide excuses for themselves and one of the common excuses is everyone is doing it or for some reason or another i am entitled to do it
5034910 i think that the basic honesty of the heroes extends a little bit to other people in that they may think that theyre more honest than others but they dont see other people as extremely dishonest or willing to cheat
5034911 even at schools that have extensive cheating based on what other students are telling me theres always a group of students who will wonder why im bothering to do this survey on their campus because they never see any cheating and they dont think anybody else cheats
5034912 as a result of that if theyre hanging out in groups or cliques that dont cheat therefore they dont see a lot of cheating
5034913 to me those are the people who have met the requirements of what theyre doing and to call that heroic is i think to minimize our basic expectations of students
5034914 we expect them to perform on these assignments and other things without cheating so when they do that thats great and i dont want to minimize that but at the same time im not sure they should be called heroes
5034915 for people that assert that they are definitely going to cheat and people who assert that they are not at all going to cheat it might be difficult to influence their behaviour but people who assert theyre uncertain suggests a population that might be more amenable to interventions
5034916 its a matter of having students involved having faculty administrators families peers anyone who could possibly be involved should be

5034924 we will work on accomplishing it within the coming weeks
5034925 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated
5034926 we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take
5034927 this year the pilgrimage was nice except for the iskandariya incident
5034928 i am certain that such a scenario is not possible in ukraine
5034929 prosperity peace and calm in crimea is the very foundation on which the interests of ukraine and neighboring russia coincide everything else is of secondary importance
5034930 if we complete this stage and go on to the next one we can be confident that there will be no russian or any other destabilization scenario in crimea
5034931 i have therefore sent an urgent proposal to the president of russia to start talks on signing an agreement that would regulate our relations in the event of military action like that which we saw at the beginning of august
5034932 in other words we need to come up with clearer rules that would ensure ukraines national security in such situations
5034933 we want the palestinian people to understand that they can achieve far more for themselves through a process of dialogue through a process of negotiation through a process of reconciliation than the extremists can ever deliver for them
5034934 this government has blood on its hands because they release these murderers that will go tomorrow to do more terror attacks on israeli civilians and the blame will be on the government

5034939 i dont think i could be where i am today with any other coach
5034940 hes so intelligent in this sport and cares about every one of his athletes hes so thorough hes always on top of things im fortunate to have a coach like him
5034941 because thats how he gets better its not like every day im in his face but when somebodys that good you have to coach hard to keep him going
5034942 we had breakfast at 8 we usually have breakfast at 7 but this morning it was at 8 before that he usually takes a shower so at 7 30 he was up and showered we went at 8 for breakfast at 8 30 we were on a bus to the water cube then we did some stretching and warm ups for 30 to 40 minutes then he puts on his competition suit and does more warm ups then he swims and after that he has lactose testing to make sure everythings in order today he had a massage normally he has doping but he didnt today he always has a massage then hell eat take a nap and then come back on the bus and do it all again usually twice a day i always plan those warm ups so they are exactly timed he starts stretching two hours before a race and is in the water an hour and a half before hes always done those things really
5034943 you couldnt get any better or more specific training than that

5034949 es un tema que ya no tiene que ver necesariamente con la producci n de la droga sino con el consumo que es un aspecto que nos preocupa mucho porque el consumo es un tema que poco a poco va afectando a nuestros pa ses y que no le hemos puesto la atenci n debida
5034950 siempre he cre do que el problema no es s lo de los productores sino tambi n de los consumidores este es un problema mundial es un tema que no se puede tratar con desd n es un problema que debe tratarse con compromiso

5034964 postmodernism is a change or be changed world the word is out reinvent yourself for the 21st century or die some would rather die than change
5034965 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5034966 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5034967 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5034968 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5034969 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5034970 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5034971 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5034972 in view of americas determination to set up a missile defense shield in europe the military is reviewing all its plans to give washington an adequate response
5034973 none of us know the circumstances under which the police felt threatened to the point of repeatedly using the taser
5034974 ill side with the police officers judgement on whether the force used was necessary 100 times out of 100
5034975 repeated prolonged and or continuous exposures to the taser may impair breathing and respiration particularly when the probes are placed across the chest or diaphragm
5034976 actually all cops get tazed as part of their training bet that is big news to you isnt it
5034977 and you know its sad its so many incidents in south florida with these tasers
5034978 the story linked to doesnt say anything to indicate improper behaviour by police
5034979 they tased him three different times they just kept tasing him i told the police youre going to kill that man so after they did it a third time i just walked away
5034980 and they just start tasing him and tasing him until they killed him and you know its sad its so many incidents in south florida with these tasers trigger happy tasers and theyre killing people and they try to justify it

5035014 i like that theres heaps of different types of singing you can express yourself in many different ways doing it

5035020 in an effort to ease the concerns that the satellite duo would use its monopoly status to gouge consumers the companies proposed new price plans like 50 channel and 100 channel a la carte offerings that would cost 13 and 15 a month
5035021 talking about such a dishonorable thing saddened me it was strongly reminiscent of former president ferdinand marcos
5035022 people in taiwan need not spend money to maintain special treatment for a former president who committed crimes
5035023 the law says that the special treatment reserved former presidents and vice presidents should be canceled if they are found guilty of treason or corruption but such regulation could not meet peoples expectations we need a stricter law banning chen from receiving such treatment from the county
5035024 i respect shihs suggestion but we should not amend the statute for a specific individual
5035025 no democratic country would condone corruption embezzlement or money laundering not to mention when such crimes are committed by the head of state
5035026 it may be a crisis for the dpp and its supporters but it is a good opportunity to examine the legislation
5035027 it is also a good opportunity to see whether prosecutors have used this incident to engage in political maneuvering and secure political points
5035028 at the time chen tsung ming said that if no concrete evidence was available the bureau could deal with it on its own therefore i did not pass the formal documents to him
5035029 its better not to have a deal than to have a bad deal
5035030 the troika continues to engage with this matter and indeed after we have formally closed the organ will convene again it is an indication of the seriousness with which sadc approaches this question
5035031 they need to reach a speedy conclusion of negotiations so that it indeed becomes possible to address the enormous challenges that face the masses of the people of zimbabwe

5035062 as far as being negative though people should be reminded that both brad wall and roy romanow were acclaimed as leaders of their parties and went on to lead their parties to success
5035063 this exclusion of the silent majority means that many problems may never be solved and one such issue is the embarrassing treatment of natives living on reserves there are 1 2 million aboriginals in canada some 700 000 of them live on reserves in conditions similar to those of third world countries despite massive federal government spending alcoholism is widespread and the suicide rate among young natives is three times higher than in the rest of the population
5035064 can we do better of course we can if we focus on two main issues a settlement to replace the pre confederation treaties signed but never respected and a better accountability system to see how the 12 billion from ottawa is spent
5035065 you need to give away more to us to make this work
5035066 aboriginals are still frustrated with their leadership because their quality of life is deteriorating

5035075 the title china taiwan has nothing to do with political ideology for people in the dominican republic when they say china they are referring to our country
5035076 the title china taiwan has nothing to do with political ideology since you live in taiwan you consider it a way of downgrading the nation but for people in the dominican republic when they say china they are referring to our country
5035077 our country has had ties with the dominican republic for more than 60 years the peoples republic of china prc hasnt
5035078 when people in the dominican republic say china mostly they are referring to us not the prc but gradually they are realizing were also called taiwan
5035079 the dominican republic is our ally and the china it recognizes according to its one china principle is the republic of china

5035085 if i would ask you in response to the same question how fast the american forces can leave iraq for example the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there

5035109 no evidence sufficient to support the claim that an observed association between abortion history and mental health was caused by the abortion per se as opposed to other factors
5035110 ik vraag me af waarom u uw verstand kwijtraakte sir lancelot want ik en menig ander meenden dat het door de liefde voor de schone elaine was koning pelleas dochter bij wie men zegt dat u een kind hebt bij de naam van galahad en men zegt dat hij vele wonderbaarlijke daden zal verrichten
5035111 als ik enige dwaasheid beging kreeg ik wat ik zocht
5035112 het volkskrantblog leidt regelmatig tot onverwachte verschijnselen zo heeft ook goedmakers vaker nieuwe toepassingen bedacht van dit blog hij poneerde een tijdlang stellingen waarop anderen konden reageren via het aanbevelingssysteem dat we hanteerden en nu kopieert hij een idee van de bbc door fotos z nder een onderschrift te plaatsen en zijn bezoekers uit te nodigen om daarbij het bijschrift te bedenken ik vind dit mooie ontwikkelingen ze tonen voor mij aan dat het volkskrantblog een eigen leven begint te leiden en dat het zich een plaats verovert in het leven van de gebruikers
5035113 ik weet alles want koningin gwenivere zond mij een brief hoe alles is gebeurd omdat ik u moest vragen hem te zoeken maar nu god zij dank
5035114 is hij genezen en gezond en teruggekeerd aan het hof
5035115 maar nu moeten u en ik ons gereed maken want wij moeten beiden op dat feest zijn
5035116 als u het goed vind zal ik daar niet zijn want door mij hebben vele goede ridders hun merktekens op u achtergelaten en om mijnentwil hebt u veel meer moeten doen dan eigenlijk nodig was
5035117 want dan zullen alle koninginnen en dames van stand schande van mij spreken want hoe kunt u die n van de edelste ridders van de wereld wordt genoemd en een ridder van de ronde tafel zijt ontbreken op dat feest en wat zal er onder de ridders over u gezegd worden och zie sir tristram toch jagen en zich vermaken met zijn valken en zich in zijn kasteel verschuilen met zijn dame en ons in de steek laten helaas zullen sommigen zeggen dat hij ooit ridder werd gemaakt en dat hij ooit de liefde van een dame verwierf en wat zullen de dames en de koninginnen van mij zeggen dat het jammer is dat ik leef als ik zo een edele ridder als u van zijn roem afhoud
5035118 dat is heel goed gezegd en een nobele raad van u en ik zie nu wel dat u van mij houdt en uw raad zal ik deels opvolgen maar er zal niemand met mij uitrijden behalve ikzelf en zo zal ik komende dinsdag uitrijden met geen andere wapens dan mijn speer en mijn zwaard
5035119 sir tristram nu zullen we elkaar treffen en eer we scheiden zullen we al onze oude geschillen vereffenen
5035120 er was nog nooit een christenmens die kon pochen dat ik voor hem gevlucht ben en weet wel sir palomides gij saracijn ook gij zult u er niet op beroemen dat sir tristram van liones ooit voor u is gevlucht
5035121 zou het moeilijk zijn hem te laten ophouden met vechten maar als ik nu omkeer en hem dood maak ik mij te schande overal waar ik kom
5035122 gij lafhartige ridder wat voert gij in uw schild en waarom wilt gij niet met mij vechten want twijfel niet dat ik u en al uw boosheid zal weerstaan
5035123 u weet heel goed dat ik mij zou schamen met u van doen te hebben want u bent hier naakt terwijl ik gewapend ben en als ik u zou doden zou schande mijn deel zijn en u weet wel
5035124 dat ik de kracht en de moed ken waarmee u een goede ridder weerstaat
5035125 nu vraag ik u een vraag te beantwoorden die ik u zal stellen
5035126 en ik zal u de waarheid antwoorden zo helpe mij god
5035127 stel nu eens dat u in alle opzichten gewapend was zoals ik nu en ik naakt zoals u nu wat zou u met mij doen bij uw ware ridderschap
5035128 nu begrijp ik u sir palomides nu moet ik mijn eigen oordeel vellen maar met gods zegen wat ik zal zeggen zal niet uit vrees voor u zijn sir palomides en het is dit weet wel sir palomides deze keer zou ik u laten gaan omdat ik niet met u van doen wilde hebben
5035129 ik kan kiezen om te rijden of te gaan maar sir palomides
5035130 er is n ding waarover ik mij zeer verbaas dat gij die zo een goede ridder zijt zich niet wilt laten dopen terwijl uw broeder sir safire al sinds jaar en dag gedoopt is
5035131 ik kan nog niet gedoopt worden vanwege een eed die ik vele jaren geleden heb gezworen ofschoon ik in mijn hart en in mijn ziel reeds lang een sterk geloof heb in jezus en zijn goede moeder maria ik moet echter nog n gevecht leveren en als dat is gedaan zal ik mij laten dopen
5035132 wat dat ene gevecht betreft daar zult gij niet lang naar hoeven zoeken want god verhoede
5035133 dat gij door mijn verzuim langer als een saracijn zou leven ginds is een ridder die gij hebt neergeworpen en verwond help mij nu om mij met zijn wapenrusting te wapenen en ik zal uw eden snel vervullen
5035134 mijn naam is sir galleron van galloway een ridder van de ronde tafel
5035135 het spijt mij werkelijk van uw wonden maar wat ik wil vragen is of u mij uw hele wapenrusting wilt lenen want u ziet dat ik ongewapend ben en ik moet slag leveren met deze ridder
5035136 sir ik geef hem u graag maar u moet oppassen want ik moet u waarschuwen dat deze ridder de taaiste ridder is die ik ooit ontmoette maar sir
5035137 ik verzoek u zeg mij uw naam en hoe is de naam van die ridder die mij heeft verslagen
5035138 sir wat mijn naam betreft weet wel dat die sir tristram van liones is en wat hem betreft zijn naam is sir palomides broeder van de goede ridder sir safire en toch is sir palomides ongedoopt
5035139 het is heel spijtig dat zo een goede ridder en zulk een edele krijgsman ongedoopt moet zijn
5035140 of hij mij nu zal doden of ik hem maar eer wij afscheid van elkaar nemen zal hij gedoopt worden
5035141 uw roem en uw vermaardheid zijn goed bekend in vele landen en moge god u deze dag behoeden voor schande of verwijt
5035142 want nu heb ik u in het nadeel zoals u mij eerder vandaag had maar het zal aan geen hof noch onder goede ridders ooit worden gezegd dat sir tristram een ridder heeft gedood die zonder wapen was neem daarom uw zwaard en laat ons een eind maken aan deze strijd
5035143 die wil ik wel be indigen want ik heb geen grote lust om langer te vechten en wel hierom mijn vergrijpen jegens u zijn niet zo groot dat we geen vrienden kunnen zijn want alles wat ik heb misdaan was en is uit liefde voor de schone isolde en van haar durf ik te zeggen dat zij geen gelijke heeft onder de vrouwen maar ook dat ik haar nooit oneerbaar heb benaderd en door haar heb ik het grootste deel van mijn roem verworven en omdat ik haar nimmer iets heb misdaan en de vergrijpen die ik heb begaan tegen u persoonlijk waren en u me daarvoor vandaag vele harde klappen hebt gegeven hoewel ik u er enkele heb teruggegeven en ik durf nu te zeggen dat ik nooit iemand heb meegemaakt met zo een kracht en zo een lange adem behalve sir lancelot du lac daarom smeek ik u mijn heer vergeef mij alles wat ik u misdaan heb en breng mij vandaag nog naar de dichtstbijzijnde kerk en laat mij daar eerst te biecht gaan en zie daarna voor uzelf dat ik waarachtig gedoopt wordt en dan zullen we allen samen naar het hof van koning arthur rijden zodat we daar zijn voor het komende hoogfeest
5035144 en zoals u zegt zo zal het geschieden en moge god u vergeven zoals ik het doe en binnen een mijl van hier is de bisschop van carlisle die u het sacrament van de doop zal geven
5035145 its so great to hear from someone who absolutely knows a technology but is not an evangelist just like dave thomas talking staight about smalltalk recently on the industry misinterpretations and agile toolkit podcasts
5035146 im surprised its a little bit late for a trade
5035147 but for me i passed my best times in this organization
5035148 sometimes guys just have off years i think that happens its a part of the game hes certainly healthy and i think a change of scenery will help him
5035149 i think going to a pennant race will help him
5035150 i cant say enough good things about luis he took the ball for us anytime he was asked and did a phenomenal job his entire career hell be missed
5035151 theyre fighting for first place so im going to do my best to clear my mind and try to help the bullpen
5035152 he attacked the hitters i kind of expect the same thing plus hes experienced thats important
5035153 he had requested to be traded this year throughout the year
5035154 we attempted to do so by the trade deadline and just were not able to make a deal that made sense for us with a month and a half left before free agency we felt we needed to get something for him
5035155 we won one event which was the first new zealand championship event that the band had won in 10 years
5035156 recently women have been entering the business at increasing levels at every level of the drug cartel
5035157 but most women in the trafficking business dont get caught so incarceration and indictment rates may not fully speak to the issue of who is doing it
5035158 there are risky huge implications for carrying drugs but there is a susceptibility among these women because they may not be as aware of these risks or the economic circumstances are so bad at home
5035159 so their life situation is used as an enticement to enter this line of work
5035160 another way they join the drug trade is by being coerced by a male actors husbands boyfriends
5035161 there have been more women women with children and whole families caught smuggling
5035162 drug traffickers think that they can use women to cross the drugs because they may look less suspicious but we are checking everyone
5035163 if you happen to see more instances of females caught with drug loads recently it may not necessarily be indicative of an overall trend because we have seen it before and we will likely see it again
5035164 now in the last three years the number of women searched has increased
5035165 but money is still a strong motivator for women to join the business
5035166 i dont care how much talent a team has if the boys dont think tough practice tough and live tough how can they play tough on saturday
5035167 it was a perfect rally for me but mikko has become a lot stronger on asphalt
5035168 this result does not mean the title is already decided
5035169 i would have preferred third but fourth on tarmac is not so bad for me
5035170 weve done some good stage times and set some good splits so if we can increase the consistency its not looking so bad for the tarmac rallies later in the season
5035171 reflective polished and conversational truer to the spirit of the event
5035172 whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is you know above my pay grade
5035173 im absolutely convinced of is that there is a moral and ethical element to this issue
5035174 mccain was energetic and forceful but relied more on his favorite lines treating it more like one of his townhall meetings he had the advantage of an overwhelmingly friendly crowd mccain was the elder statesman telling his best stories
5035175 without a doubt the lowest moment of the night was obamas smear of clarence thomas he like harry reid cant simply disagree with thomas he has to try to degrade him on obamas best day he cant hold a candle to thomass intelligence obama can barely make it through a press conference and ducks town hall debates with mccain because of his inability to speak in complete sentences when pressed to show his much noted but usually absent brilliance
5035176 i wouldnt have nominated clarence thomas i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i disagree with his interpretations of a lot of the constitution
5035177 now the one thing that i think is very important is for us to have some humility in how we approach the issue of confronting evil you know a lot of evil has been perpetrated based on the claim that we were trying to confront evil in the name of good and i think one thing thats very important is having some humility in recognizing that you know just because we think our intentions are good doesnt mean that were going to be doing good

5035200 they will take the reservation but not necessarily hold the reservation
5035201 as soon as we found out we had to make arrangements for it to be excavated because of the danger of it going into the sea
5035202 we dont know how tall he would have been because the long bones were fragmented little is known about him but he may have been of importance to the small community that he would have come from as it appears that special care was taken over his burial
5035203 i was walking along the coast which is a particularly rich area for remains i was actually looking for flint and there was one area that was particularly eroded from pedestrian access while searching one particular area i found a front tooth and another piece of bone and i looked to see where it had come from i could see from the bit of flint sticking out of the ground that it was actually a stone lined cisk
5035204 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5035205 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5035206 that fraud has increased and appraisal fraud has increased in a way to exacerbate the problems
5035207 the higher the loan amount the more money brokers and lenders make in the deal
5035208 and they threaten you they say if you dont play ball with us well go somewhere else and they do ive seen my business shrink theyre all doing it its hard to stay honest
5035209 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis
5035210 we got to this point by a lack of enforcement the public has the right to expect the appraisal boards are taking care of that problem
5035211 do you know what that would have meant the net effect is it would have effectively shut down mortgage lending in that state
5035212 to take that action would have been an unbelievable disruption to the economy i wasnt going to do that
5035213 either you shut it off completely in a state or you just send letters
5035214 the threat of the atomic bomb is the only thing
5035215 they know they can keep doing what theyre doing because they can get away with it
5035216 theyre not getting punished and states arent doing more because they know regulators wont do a thing
5035217 i wasnt alone we had appraisers from all over the nation writing in and urging them to take action
5035218 resulting from inappropriate pressure being placed on real estate property appraisers to hit a certain value
5035219 people who say we should have done more dont understand how the system works
5035220 agencies just dont lobby to change things we had no interest in doing anything like that it just wasnt our area
5035221 good position to work with bank regulators and others on the problem
5035222 everything related to the issue went into a black hole why i just dont know
5035223 i tried to push but nobody wanted to hear what i was saying
5035224 problem appraisals are being allowed and in some ways even encouraged by a regulatory structure that promotes lax enforcement and ineffective oversight
5035225 we are here to alert congress that the licensing system it created for appraisers is broken and needs to be fixed
5035226 but states dont have the money to hire personnel to carry out what the system was designed to do
5035227 may have been rude or said my house wasnt worth as much as i thought
5035228 just because youre disciplined that doesnt make you a bad appraiser
5035229 i may have done some technical things wrong but ive done a good job im proud of my work
5035230 why should he get super zapped for doing a lot of little things that a lot of other appraisers are doing every day but havent had complaints turned in on them

5035235 the ana are very well equipped to conduct counter insurgency operations
5035236 the fact is the ana are afghans they speak the language and understand the culture they are able to do a great job of counter insurgency because the people truly identify with them
5035237 our mp platoon has done an absolutely fabulous job mentoring the ana and anp and their hard effort has paid off by making this transition possible
5035238 our whole goal is to transfer as many district centers to ansf control as possible so we can begin to concentrate on different areas that we need to focus our combat power at

5035245 of course youngs right hes just blaming the wrong party apple sells music via their itunes store at the best quality levels the music cartels will allow if you want to criticize then criticize those responsible for the problem please leave apple out of it we suppose you could stretch far beyond the bounds of reason and attempt to blame apple for not including 500 audiophile quality headphones with every ipod but lets stay realistic apple ipods are perfectly capable of playing pristine high fidelity sound with frequency responses of 20hz to 20 000hz apples itunes can import using the extremely high quality apple lossless encoder in fact apple even offered encoding in mp3 format at bit rates up to 320 kbps at no extra cost long before most other applications of course youll sacrifice hard drive space for sound quality bottom line the music cartels not apple are to blame for not allowing real high resolution music to be sold online which is youngs real criticism we believe apple apple ipod and apples itunes software are not to blame you can easily get very high quality music into and out of an apple ipod using apples itunes software

5035250 hey can we go to the place with the little donuts
5035251 he was choking the s t out of me and i wasnt fixing to die that night
5035252 i didnt have my music on and my windows were rolled up
5035253 plus it was cold and i had my leather jacket on
5035254 they slammed me down on the ground put pistols and tasers to my back
5035255 i didnt know what they were here for they said it was for assaulting a peace officer
5035256 whenever he told me to watch my mouth i looked at him like he was crazy like he didnt look like an actual police officer to me
5035257 decker was calling me a chicken s mother f get out and i will beat your ass
5035258 there was nothing we could do but make the best of it
5035259 i dont ever want to deal with a storm like that again believe me it will change your attitude for the worse
5035260 here it is the first issue of businessweek created in collaboration with readers in surveys blogs and polls you identified problems at work together we found answers
5035261 like savvy coaches savvy entrepreneurs mind their stores using a flurry of metrics some are obvious things like revenues gross profit margin and dollars of scrap but many others arent or at least theyre not monitored and while you dont have to be a wall street securities analyst to run a successful small business having a handle on these numbers can make a huge difference both in day to day management and in long term planning
5035262 in 40 years every single american could be overweight according to a recent study employing that same logic 13 out of every 10 adult americans by then wont have landlines the phone forecast is impossible of course but its arguably no less solidly grounded than the obesity forecast the weight projection uses three data points spread out over nearly three decades to estimate a linear trend then brazenly draws that line into the future
5035263 the news this year is that even those chief executives who deliver subpar returns are showing unexpected staying power
5035264 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5035265 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5035266 we know millions of dollars are being made yearly so how about distributing a little back to the little people
5035267 what really gets me is the smaller branches are getting time and a half and our production rate is a lot higher this is the head office
5035268 when the police asked us to move we moved to the side and let the trucks pass
5035269 we will play each day as it comes were willing to go into negotiations right now all we are waiting for is the company to give us a call
5035270 there is simply no excuse for not adhering to road rules and regulations at intersections
5035271 the officer who attended the first crash was at the scene completing the investigation when the second crash occurred in front of him
5035272 both crashes occurred because of basic driver error in failing to ensure the way was clear before moving out into the line of traffic
5035273 drivers who fail to pay attention or comply with give way and stop regulations are gambling with not only their own lives but the lives of other road users
5035274 we will be enforcing and concentrating on areas where motorists fail to give way or fail to comply with traffic signals and do not come to a complete stop at stop signs
5035275 we will be focusing on historical high crash rate areas which apart from silverdale include the coatesville riverhead highway intersections with state highway 17 at albany and state highway 16 at kumeu
5035276 the skulls were found plastered that is to say sculpted which is a phenomenon that is identified with the neolithic
5035277 the practice included the reconstruction of all of the facial features of the deceased by means of sculpting the skull with a variety of materials such as plaster that was specifically intended for this on the skulls that were found in the excavation the nose was entirely reconstructed
5035278 some time thereafter the residents would dig up the grave retrieve the skull from the rest of the skeleton and recover the grave
5035279 i knew it was an exciting find and i did show it to some people but never to any real experts
5035280 i had been doing my lawn and dug it out accidentally with a digger it was a big round circle with a tiny dark tunnel leading off it which seems to go quite far
5035281 my children couldnt believe it when we found it it was great and the tunnel seems structurally safe and dry so eventually i might do it up and maybe try and put some kind of lights in there to make going in there a bit easier
5035282 these graves reveal istanbul used to be home to some of the earliest types of settlements during the stone age when people migrated from anatolia to the european continent
5035283 they also show that the marmara sea used to be a small and shallow water in ancient times
5035284 it is the first finding of this kind on the european mainland which we have been able to fully excavate and which shows a structure we have until now only seen in britain
5035285 the way it is built with many concentrated rings of graves walls palisades and pillars are very similar to the british monument at stonehenge
5035286 for years these people have wrongly been thought of as individuals whose only wish was to eat reproduce and protect themselves from the elements and predators
5035287 now we discover that 12 000 years ago they granted their babies the same rights as adults
5035288 we cant rule out the possibility that the stones were placed as markers to indicate the graves of children
5035289 the infants were carefully buried in a seated or reclining position
5035290 the stones were deliberately placed above the bodies and may have served as grave markers the careful burial ritual suggests that the infants were a valued part of their community
5035291 we discovered that sometimes to make room they moved the bones from older graves but never those of newborns no grave of an infant has been disturbed
5035292 the infant skeletons are exceptionally complete and well preserved and will allow us to undertake studies of infant health growth and diet
5035293 the adult skeletons will reveal information on illnesses and injuries diet and activity patterns
5035294 some believe the female owners of the insignias used them to place their seal on valuable documents others believe the owners may have used the seal to indicate their lofty status in society

5035332 discerning christians recognized the tell tale signs of a disaster in the making at the lakeland revival weve seen these sorts of tragedies occur time and time again in the body of christ over the decades
5035333 we all hoped to see a different outcome here but the fruit of bentleys personal life reveals he was not ready for the level of public ministry he received and that he should never have been commissioned in an internationally televised apostolic alignment commissioning service stepping down is an appropriate move in the right direction our concern is not only for the bentleys but the thousands of people around the world who are questioning everything they saw on god tv from the meetings at the lakeland revival a lot of healing is going to be needed in the days ahead and many questions answered
5035334 todd bentley has agreed to step down from his position and to refrain from all public ministry for a season to receive counsel in his personal life
5035335 we are deeply saddened by these recent events but it hasnt shaken our faith
5035336 many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life some to shame and everlasting contempt
5035337 it is appointed for men to die once and after this the judgement
5035338 all who are in the graves will hear his voice and shall come forth those who have done good to the resurrection of life and those who have done evil to the resurrection of condemnation
5035339 your dead shall live they shall arise awake and sing you who dwell in the dust
5035340 larry can you be any more of a yankee apologist just look past your yankee myopia and try some objectivity
5035341 wow larry youve produced 25 of the comments on this thread and said nothing meaningful thats impressive even for you
5035342 after reading all your postings and daily weblog i believe you have truly become the phil pepe of this generation now this is not necessarily a good thing
5035343 you blog sucks it reeds as it was written by the queer son of mike lupica and roids clemens i could write a better column by letting a monkey fuk a typewriter i dont need no 181 million dollar team to write a blog fukkk the spankeees

5035349 for the past two years crude has followed the dollar almost lock step
5035350 the strength weve seen in the dollar is almost certainly helping bring crude down at this point as you move backward it actually acts as a stimulus on the economy
5035351 as for housing starts i think everyone is expecting them to remain soft ppi wont be much of a market mover as commodities have been moving lower which makes last months numbers irrelevant

5035357 were unlikely to be given keys to pick up after hours so we have to do it in day time when businesses are open
5035358 our trucks end up having to double park in busy streets and we have been fined for that
5035359 but i dont believe the council wishes to go down that track
5035360 a lot of places are teaming up with other people or putting their material where someone has got a backyard and can store it
5035361 there are other solutions out there and the council doesnt see it as appropriate that the footpath be used as a storage ground for other peoples recyclables
5035362 were very pleased with the way the vast majority of businesses are meeting the clear street objective
5035363 in the past week we have received numerous very disturbing reports from tourists and locals alike regarding the wholesale killing of wildlife in particular elephants
5035364 guys seem to have an innate fascination with watching demolition
5035365 add to this the science behind it and the idea of two brothers doing all the demolition physically and we think human wrecking balls is an excellent addition to our programming line up
5035366 its happening all over town were aware of a number of suburban shops that have been converted to worker accommodation
5035367 the owners are obviously looking to get a return on them using them as cheap accommodation
5035368 theyre generally housing migrant workers and are often high density in terms of sleeping when we pull up at a premise which is supposed to be a shop and we discover there are a whole lot of people there it can be quite a problem
5035369 they could potentially be liable if there was a loss of property or even of a life if they havent done things by the book
5035370 you knew it was used by prehistoric people because you can see the artifacts right on the surface
5035371 its where you start to see milk really being used
5035372 as you go to other locations the cattle evidence is much weaker and the milk residues also show up much more weakly
5035373 this study shows that if you get into serious milk consumption where youre using pottery and preparing your milk its really related to cattle suddenly coming onstream
5035374 the human skeletons as well as the associated artifacts such as pottery ornaments and food remains like shells and animal bones are currently being analysed in order to extract more information about the burials and lifestyles of the ancient people who lived in the niah subis region during that time
5035375 there is information on the summoning of the six guards black water company accused opened fire and killed 17 iraqis in the eagle square last september
5035376 the government stresses that the government retains full rights to prosecute the guards for committing this offence
5035377 it appears that on present form the iraqi government probably wont proceed with most of these or all of them
5035378 but i think that some of the companies are open to continued discussions even on relationship grounds and some of the companies dont think its worth their time
5035379 para la comunidad de madrid es un orgullo que los nadadores puedan disfrutar y trabajar en instalaciones de primer nivel como esta en las que disponen no s lo de todas las facilidades en lo que respecta a infraestructuras sino tambi n de la m xima atenci n y apoyo por parte de los t cnicos de la federaci n madrile a
5035380 el ejemplo de patricia es claro y nuestro deber es ofrecer las mejores condiciones para entrenar a nuestros deportistas y a cualquiera que lo necesite
5035381 es una pena que tenga que marcharse porque no encuentra el apoyo y las instalaciones necesarias unas condiciones que sin duda encontrar a en este centro de nataci n m 86 y que nosotros le ofrecemos para que l s lo tenga que preocuparse de entrenar y de mejorar el nivel de la nataci n espa ola
5035382 yo soy una persona muy vergonzosa pero nunca en mi vida hab a sentido tanta verg enza la gente de michelin no reconoce los errores adem s son arrogantes hacen ver como si tampoco fuera tan malo eso es lo peor de todo
5035383 ha sido la peor carrera de mi vida la m s no se puede llegar a decir ni que haya corrido una carrera he pensado en meterme en el box he estado a punto pero pod a coger un punto
5035384 he salido bien he intentado mantenerme en la primera vuelta pero en la segunda se me ha empezado a ir mucho la moto de delante cada vez que intentaba forzar y ya iba con cuidado para no caerme ha habido una vuelta que he estado a punto de caerme dos veces y he intentado llevar un ritmo m s lento pero era imposible
5035385 para colmo he empezado a tener problemas con el neum tico de atr s y al final iba con tiempos de las motos de 250 muy despacio ha sido muy vergonzoso tener que pilotar de esa manera no s lo que sienten en el equipo para m hoy no he corrido he dado unas vueltas un paseo
5035386 lo primero es volver a motivarme y seguir hay que intentar no perder la ilusi n en las cosas antes de venir al gran premio los propios de michelin ya te dicen bueno los entrenos no fueron muy bien aqu ya no llegas con la ilusi n que deber a ser
5035387 creo que el mundial est perdido con el error de stoner rossi no debe tener ninguna presi n aunque alg n d a quedemos por delante de l
5035388 lo importante cuando uno se equivoca es afrontarlo ponerte cara a cara y decir no lo hice bien esto es lo mejor que uno puede hacer ponerse de cara al problema y apartarlo de delante es la nica opci n que tengo
5035389 el error no es ni de honda ni de dani pedrosa el error es de quien hace los neum ticos que no los hace bien se es el error si los neum ticos fueran competitivos en todas las carreras no habr a ning n problema

5035406 acting administrator jovita carranza has been a good friend to the hispanic business community
5035407 we look forward to working with administrator baruah as we continue collaborating with the sba to expand opportunities for hispanic owned businesses
5035408 there is a lot of time left for this administration to help reform sba programs and promote the cause of minority entrepreneurship
5035409 while a recess appointment may not be ideal and may even be challenged as stakeholders we will meet with administrator baruah and take on the responsibility of informing him about our business communitys needs and priorities
5035410 the financial strength and stability of our families and our businesses is vital to the economic empowerment of our community
5035411 in light of this fact and consistent with our mission at the ushcc we are honored to work with s usa life insurance company the countrys first truly bilingual life insurance company to provide a membership program that will offer affordable and accessible options for our business owners and their employees
5035412 hispanic owned businesses and families deserve greater access to life insurance and financial security
5035413 in a study conducted by limra nearly 35 percent of hispanics with dependents stated they were very concerned about not having adequate protection in the event of premature death s usa is honored to have the trust of the ushcc to offer solutions to concerns such as these to its membership
5035414 we are excited to begin our california pilot programs which will assist us in measuring the needs and demands for life insurance products and services within our hispanic communities
5035415 s usas financial stability premier product offerings and state of the art technology platform puts them in a great position to take on this exciting initiative
5035416 it would be the best bet to say that at the thursday meeting he would be given a 10 day notice
5035417 weve had a strong caucus over the last parliamentary term all of whom have worked very hard by placing them all in the top 50 we are presenting a united and experienced team who are now able to get on with the job of campaigning hard for the party vote
5035418 six sales remains a very weak performance compared with july 2007 at 17 or 65 down on the same month last year however this months results should be read as positive news albeit only just
5035419 because of the small data set we need to take care with interpreting the median value but this statistic is showing us that the property market is remaining notably stable although travelling at a much lower level of activity
5035420 our australian cousins are featuring strongly in our buyer make up
5035421 with the australian dollar currently about 25 stronger than the nz dollar australian buyers in a position to purchase property have clearly noted that the new zealand market is offering value to them
5035422 the downward moving official cash rate and the new zealand dollar are both seen as positive indicators although they are both lights that are far off at the end of the tunnel
5035423 i am surprised i am so low on the list but thats life thats politics
5035424 i thought i had done quite a bit of work for the party during the campaign last time and behind the scenes on policy i expected a higher ranking
5035425 but were very aware that the polls move around and historically once the campaign proper starts the major parties often drop and the smaller parties lift
5035426 so we have to be mindful of that and work very hard to the final hour its going to be a fight
5035427 i am determined to do a good job for the party and the people of the city
5035428 we have a lot of major issues affecting the city such as tertiary and health we have to have someone on the ground to deal with them even though this is a labour stronghold a lot of people give national their party vote and they deserve their own person to reflect their views in wellington
5035429 you may think it quite unreasonable to lay these challenges on you at a time when you are here to celebrate success
5035430 but a university qualification carries with it an expectation that you will be in a better position than most to make a contribution to our future
5035431 your real strength lies not only in your individual accomplishments but in the power you have as a group and the vast range of knowledge and subjects that underpin your collective scholarship
5035432 answers to the global challenges over the next 50 years will require more collaborative approaches to problem solving scientists and philosophers working together food technologists and language teachers historians and geographers horticulturists and social workers mathematicians and doctors teachers and geologists indigenous scholars and economists
5035433 it has been an overwhelming honour to receive a doctorate from my old university not only for myself but especially for my wife and my family my colleagues and for my people
5035434 anything i may have accomplished is a tribute to the many who have made it possible
5035435 national has concluded that gas will be a critical part of the generation mix
5035436 we believe this policy will be positive for vector as embedded or close to market gas generation at rodney and otahuhu will be constructed
5035437 we see this as positive for contact through its geothermal strategy and trustpower through its hydro and wind development portfolio
5035438 no details of the scheme are outlined we believe this will be a very tough process politically for national and is unlikely to be successful given that labour will have failed twice in its endeavours to introduce emission trading legislation
5035439 i think the survey results were a good reflection of what we were hearing anecdotally from businesses in dunedin
5035440 its a very good question its a bit like when you throw a pebble into a pond there are ripples near where it hits the water but further out the benefits are less
5035441 hospitality was closely impacted but further out suppliers of food to restaurants may also benefit but are not as noticeable the survey might not have picked up these types of businesses
5035442 i havent read the report but i think anecdotally there were a lot of people in town having a good time i would take the conclusion from that that the game had a good impact on businesses
5035443 the absurd move to fence a second section highlighted the complete disrespect of heritage values on that site was remnants of the last remaining true gold miners hut
5035444 mistaken if they believe any benefits from the land will automatically return to the community via the council
5035445 its a fallacy for anyone to think those titles will automatically return to the council the public trust is statutorily obliged to auction that land and the proceeds will be held for the absentee landowners it will go on the market to the highest bidder
5035446 awesome and friendly staff here serving up great inexpensive organic coffees that are always fresher than i am in the morning even though
5035447 is this it really this is the smallest cup of espresso ever
5035448 australian circulation and readership results continue to be among the highest in the world reinforcing australias seemingly irrepressible appetite for magazines
5035449 the latest results reflect a solid outcome in light of the deterioration in consumer confidence the magazine industry is now entering a phase of unprecedented marketing and launch activity and is well placed to benefit from improvements in the underlying economic environment
5035450 the latest circulation audit confirms pacific magazines strength in its key publishing categories home and lifestyle womens weeklies fashion tween mens lifestyle youth and health
5035451 it is a tough market and i dont say were immune but we have had a very strong year
5035452 were not deeply concerned about levels of consumer confidence were a little bit protected from that because we dont have that exposure to weeklies
5035453 we need to be relevant to what is happening in the industry
5035454 there are massive changes going on and delivery of content through web and digital media is becoming increasingly important from a media buyers and an advertisers point of view it is critical that some sanity be brought to web measurement
5035455 but none of it is public none of it is comparative none of it is done in an audited way
5035456 because there is no industry standard people can say what they like and there is any number of cowboys out there making the wildest of wild claims on what their websites are doing if you want to sell space on a website advertisers want to know how many users it has and how long they spend and these are definable metrics one thing we can do as part of the audit process is to define the metrics and make sure people adhere to it
5035457 there are a number of different ways people are putting forward their cases for ad dollars advertisers need a trustworthy uniform system of measurement so they can determine where their money is best invested
5035458 how do you feel that your record has been broken
5035459 how will you make the world a better place with your celebrity
5035460 how dare you make fun of a vietnam veteran and get a hair cut young man
5035461 the brrs bruces rave and rant of the world are the cause of the poor education our children receive in maths and the numerical sciences at least
5035462 meaningless sites like bwuces rave and five pubes is a waste of time
5035463 if the full emissions costs of producing these fuels are taken into account they cause more greenhouse gasses than conventional fuels
5035464 show that the entire surface of the earth cannot create enough additional biomass to replace more than 10 percent of current fossil fuel use
5035465 billions in assets geared toward buying moving storing and processing corn
5035466 lowest fuel yield per acre of any major biodiesel crop
5035467 we just knew that if we just kept driving and we just kept pushing that we could do something and you can see that theres a lot of love here now
5035468 the reasoning was that those who were offended could turn away
5035469 but that doesnt prevent the state from criminalizing a verbal assault of repeated loud profanities in a public place that disrupts the rights of others
5035470 but you dont have the right to continue to assault people with offensive speech once theyve indicated they dont want to hear it
5035471 for the past two years crude has followed the dollar almost lock step
5035472 the strength weve seen in the dollar is almost certainly helping bring crude down at this point as you move backward it actually acts as a stimulus on the economy
5035473 as for housing starts i think everyone is expecting them to remain soft ppi wont be much of a market mover as commodities have been moving lower which makes last months numbers irrelevant
5035474 i dont think were out of the woods yet on financials because i dont think were out of the woods on housing
5035475 when we have new orders thats going to tell you are people ready to put stuff on the shelf
5035476 its important because one of the big drags on the gdp in the second quarter was inventory
5035477 any geopolitical developments whether it be the iranian situation or further developments with russia and georgia those will influence oil markets

5035486 at the time of graduation nearly three out of five class of 2006 two year college graduates 59 2 percent on average had a job at the time of the follow up survey nearly three quarters 74 4 percent had secured employment
5035487 die finanzkrise ist ein externer faktor der uns in diesem jahr belastet f r unsere kunden wird sich hieraus jedoch kein nachteil ergeben
5035488 im very happy to have won here germany is a special rally for me
5035489 we had a good feeling in the car all weekend and had no real problems to contend with everything worked out well and now i am in the best position to start the rest of the season
5035490 maybe new zealand will be a little more difficult now i will be first on the road because there is a lot of loose gravel especially if its dry but at the moment im happy to take the lead of the championship and pleased with the job dani and i did for citroen
5035491 im pleased because second is a good result for both championships for me in the drivers and its helped citroen to the lead of the manufacturers
5035492 of course im still trying to win a rally myself but it wasnt this event i made a few mistakes and lost a lot of time on the first day but on the second i changed some suspension settings and the feeling was very good since then for citroen a one two is very encouraging for the rest of the season
5035493 i would have preferred third but fourth for me is not so bad on tarmac
5035494 i knew today would be very difficult with casey stoner so strong and his first lap was impressive
5035495 i lost a bit of time with john hopkins in the first corner because he overtook me this time we had the pace with stoner and i was catching up with him i knew my setting and the tyres were working well
5035496 i think i could possibly have beaten him in a battle unfortunately he crashed and then i was ahead with an 11 second lead if he hadnt have crashed then things would have been tougher for sure
5035497 it has been a difficult season until now the situation changed at sachsenring with some new parts which helped me at laguna seca i made a mistake but i knew that it would be possible to podium here
5035498 qualifying was really difficult and so i started further back on the grid here i passed many riders and the last seven laps i was comfortable with my pace
5035499 im really happy after barcelona i was not in good enough condition to ride well after three weeks off in the summer break i am fit
5035500 for the past two years crude has followed the dollar almost lock step
5035501 the strength weve seen in the dollar is almost certainly helping bring crude down at this point as you move backward it actually acts as a stimulus on the economy
5035502 as for housing starts i think everyone is expecting them to remain soft ppi wont be much of a market mover as commodities have been moving lower which makes last months numbers irrelevant
5035503 when we have new orders thats going to tell you are people ready to put stuff on the shelf
5035504 its important because one of the big drags on the gdp in the second quarter was inventory all about oil
5035505 any geopolitical developments whether it be the iranian situation or further developments with russia and georgia those will influence oil markets
5035506 all the works of man have their origin in creative fantasy what right have we then to depreciate imagination
5035507 a place where the collision of nature and spirit became a reality
5035508 the hardest thing at the olympics in the high jump is just getting to the finals once youre in the finals youre carefree you dont have to worry about anything
5035509 my clearance at 7 4 1 2 wasnt that great i knew i needed to give a lot more at 7 6 i definitely put forth the effort it just wasnt good enough
5035510 there has been just so much support from my family and friends especially back in raleigh
5035511 itll be hard to go home and face everyone i let myself down i know i didnt let all of them down because i made it to beijing but i really expected to do a lot better you put so much effort in one meet so when you dont do well it really hurts it sucks
5035512 yeah my coach will make me ready but i was ready today thats the thing
5035513 im in great shape probably the best of my life i could have gotten a personal best

5035516 the fact that ukraine is no longer a party to the 1992 agreement allows it to launch active cooperation with european countries to integrate its information
5035517 the international community is clear that south ossetia and abkhazia are part of georgia and the us fully recognises this reality
5035518 the phone was ringing a month ago with people saying whens it coming
5035519 the fruit was delayed near kaikoura by weather and slips and everyones put in a huge last minute effort to make it come together we find with this project people really get behind it too make work
5035520 you cant restrict people from going in there but its irresponsible if there are warnings out there especially given the recent weather
5035521 walking around in avalanche country is dicing with death its not only putting yourself at risk its the rescue people involved who are also put at risk
5035522 you know what though i might not and thatll be okay
5035523 no really im serious because ive already met one soul mate and thats more than most people get to meet in their lifetime
5035524 if im not destined to meet the man of my dreams than so be it i have to come to terms with that gloriously morbid fact
5035525 i was a bit disappointed as we needed a clear round
5035526 she rolette jumped slowly and touched the rail a little but we held it together to finish the course inside the time
5035527 but she is an unbelievable horse we are not out of it yet and still have a chance
5035528 how does it feel meeting with someone who tore down your democratic colleague in the last election
5035529 you know he has a lot longer track record than that
5035530 he has been doing he is you know a legendary entrepreneur and there are a lot of things that i think we have to unify the country around it is having an intelligent energy policy
5035531 we are going to be over the long term putting enormous pressure on ordinary families here in america who just arent going to be able to afford you know skyrocketing gasoline prices and home heating prices
5035532 so this is one of those issues that i think should unify the country and that is what we are going to be talking about
5035533 it was a very bad batch of diaries and it will get washed out very quickly
5035534 as alan said when he held a press conference we are looking to extend him
5035535 so we are not looking to a future beyond alan jones we are looking forward to the future with alan jones
5035536 the most successful athlete in olympic history is michael phelps and his triumphs are pushed back to make way for gossip in hollywood entertainment program access hollywood
5035537 we feel sorry for the 300 million americans whod have seen the swimming live on seven in australia
5035538 the problem for seven in this instance is because beijing is so close to the sydney timeline thats the good news because audiences go through the roof
5035539 and because its so close to sydney time thats the bad news for seven because they cant win people are thinking i know fred smiths swimming at 10 30 and theyre waiting at 10 30 for that race
5035540 i dont know that anyone knows the speed at which its going to happen because weve badly predicted it all the way along and we havent got it right
5035541 and here unfortunately people hold on to economic models as long as they possibly can whether its advertising or the tv industry and the consumers are going to say weve had enough of that theres options now
5035542 here when a channel pays so much for the rights it has to protect the rights and its not going to be able to do that much longer certainly it wont be the case in london
5035543 in theory every event should be able to be seen live in 2012
5035544 its going to be an interesting four years because the ioc wants to continue to sell the rights and the consumer is expecting they wont have to pay for it by looking at advertising so this whole model could be turned upside down in four years
5035545 broadcasters should be thinking deeply about what else they can add to those rights
5035546 there will be increased hours in all areas i cant quantify that at this stage but there will definitely be increased hours whether its on free to air subscription tv or mobile
5035547 a lot will change before 2012 but the fundamentals of viewing are probably still pretty sound
5035548 from that perspective we dont see the internet as being a substitute for subscription television at all its an adjunct to it
5035549 the linking of delivery to hand held devices will be the big thing in 2012
5035550 those services are now good enough when you look at the likes of the iphone for us to be satisfied by watching a telecast on a hand held device and not go to the tv
5035551 why with a 10c fairfax dividend likely to be on the table next week and with the stock trading at a low point are they selling now
5035552 since i am a process control engineer i would like to call to your attention something we learned a long time ago when you really need predictability you create a feedback system that can respond to change as it occurs rather than a predictive system that is incapable of dealing with variation
5035553 there are defined processes for problem solving that do work
5035554 the sketches in the american comic papers made us yearn
5035555 mr traill by the by went to london and discovered mr phil may and commended him also to australia
5035556 look here mr may hopkins puts a good deal more work into his drawings than you do cant you finish yours up a bit
5035557 when i can leave out half the lines i use now i shall want six times the money i am being paid now

5035559 it was the dearest wish of all black and white artists to get into the bulletin
5035560 damn it id expect an association lasting 60 years to count for something youd think i was an office boy theyd caught pinching stamps
5035561 the new editor was a person named donald horne slight pale stooping and intense he prowled from room to room fixing people with a single glittering eye and under its power they melted somewere sacked some resigned some just ran
5035562 i guess we are unique in the fact that we are the oldest continuously running commercial organisation in australia
5035563 we will have been around for 200 years in april of next year
5035564 we have a strong brand in terms of trust we are real and people see us and trust as we have a very human face
5035565 even in terms of letters it is still a vital form of communication and businesses continue to send their letters through australia post
5035566 i think the essence of the brand really comes down to trust
5035567 there has been external research with different customers and we are consistently rated as one of the most trustworthy brands
5035568 it increases i guess because there is a lot of consumer distrust in brands
5035569 australia post has done a lot of work to understand its branding and then make sure all the tools are in place internally and are part of our own everyday business
5035570 then in terms of everything we do in internal communications trust permeates all that
5035571 it came back to a brand campaign that showed the fact that we touch millions of people every working day
5035572 we do a lot of staff attitude surveys and i think they perceive australia post well there is a lot of internal communication
5035573 at the executive level we have a brand review forum and the job for senior executives is to continue to protect and build the equity of the brand
5035574 inflation costs have not been addressed by the state funding formulas for three years
5035575 unless the state adjusts the formula well be looking at cutting something
5035576 i believe the finance system needs to be reformed so there is not only an index for inflation which includes gas utilities and insurance costs which are going up for all school districts as well as an ability for the school districts to keep more of their money
5035577 we talked quite a bit about our offense today some different actions were trying to incorporate we tried to bring those out in a live setting so we got out our guys that were working against
5035578 tomorrow well break down our defense a little bit more
5035579 the italians are great fans but they love you when you win and they hate you when you lose we were booed right out of that gym when we lost at home in front of a sold out crowd

5035583 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5035584 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5035585 that fraud has increased and appraisal fraud has increased in a way to exacerbate the problems
5035586 the higher the loan amount the more money brokers and lenders make in the deal
5035587 and they threaten you they say if you dont play ball with us well go somewhere else and they do ive seen my business shrink theyre all doing it its hard to stay honest
5035588 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis
5035589 we got to this point by a lack of enforcement the public has the right to expect the appraisal boards are taking care of that problem
5035590 do you know what that would have meant the net effect is it would have effectively shut down mortgage lending in that state
5035591 to take that action would have been an unbelievable disruption to the economy i wasnt going to do that
5035592 either you shut it off completely in a state or you just send letters
5035593 the threat of the atomic bomb is the only thing
5035594 they know they can keep doing what theyre doing because they can get away with it
5035595 theyre not getting punished and states arent doing more because they know regulators wont do a thing
5035596 i wasnt alone we had appraisers from all over the nation writing in and urging them to take action
5035597 resulting from inappropriate pressure being placed on real estate property appraisers to hit a certain value
5035598 people who say we should have done more dont understand how the system works
5035599 agencies just dont lobby to change things we had no interest in doing anything like that it just wasnt our area
5035600 good position to work with bank regulators and others on the problem
5035601 everything related to the issue went into a black hole why i just dont know
5035602 i tried to push but nobody wanted to hear what i was saying
5035603 problem appraisals are being allowed and in some ways even encouraged by a regulatory structure that promotes lax enforcement and ineffective oversight
5035604 we are here to alert congress that the licensing system it created for appraisers is broken and needs to be fixed
5035605 but states dont have the money to hire personnel to carry out what the system was designed to do
5035606 may have been rude or said my house wasnt worth as much as i thought
5035607 just because youre disciplined that doesnt make you a bad appraiser
5035608 i may have done some technical things wrong but ive done a good job im proud of my work
5035609 why should he get super zapped for doing a lot of little things that a lot of other appraisers are doing every day but havent had complaints turned in on them
5035610 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
5035611 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5035612 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the would rally around it
5035613 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
5035614 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice
5035615 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5035616 en casa seguimos con mucha atenci n su desarrollo una vez que se hubo abierto comenzaron a venir las mocas a las pocas horas vimos que hab an puesto huevos en el centro de la flor al rato vinieron hormigas coloradas que comenzaron a llevarse los huevos de las moscas todo el ciclo de la vida nacimiento muerte alimentaci n se reunieron en pocas horas en el centro de esa flor tan rara
5035617 i personally object but must allow choice in a pluralistic society
5035618 children are a gift of the lord they are his reward
5035619 you formed my inmost being you knit me in my mothers womb
5035620 but we also know that roe v wade is about more than a womans right to choose its about equality its about whether our daughters are going to have the same opportunities as our sons
5035621 lader was a fascinating farrago of paradox he was economically secure having been left a considerable trust fund upon the death of his father many years before yet he had worked for vito marcantonio the only card carrying communist ever to be elected to the u s house of representatives he was an ardent feminist and a great admirer of margaret sanger and a patriarchal bully in his own household and he was obsessed with abortion
5035622 our favorite tack was to blame the church for the death of every woman from a botched abortion
5035623 there were perhaps three hundred or so deaths from criminal abortions annually in the united states in the sixties but naral in its press releases claimed to have data that supported a figure of five thousand fortunately the respected biostatistician dr christopher tietze was our ally though he never actually staked himself to a specific number he never denied the authenticity of these claims
5035624 consult on political strategy and tactics with pro abortion leaders in many other states
5035625 the first thing i will do as president is sign the freedom of choice act
5035626 this act applies to every federal state and local statute ordinance regulation administrative order decision policy practice or other action enacted adopted or implemented before on or after the date of enactment of this act
5035627 statement of policy it is the policy of the united states that every woman has the fundamental right to choose to bear a child to terminate a pregnancy prior to fetal viability or to terminate a pregnancy after fetal viability when necessary to protect the life or health of the woman
5035628 the first thing i will do as president is sign the freedom of choice act
5035629 who among us is so cold blooded as to vote to deny health care to a baby born alive during a late term abortion and allow that baby to die
5035630 thats because this pro abortion position is antithetical to the biblical view of babies
5035631 nurse stanek spoke to legislators in formal testimony offering her detailed eyewitness account of live infants tossed out to die alone amidst the medical waste
5035632 it was the bolshevik atheist communists who first promoted this thoroughly twisted baby as hardship ideology just as it is the communist countries today that so wholeheartedly support abortion as a way of managing population growth and female workers utility
5035633 by the hands of a few diehard bolsheviks and 7 supreme court justices
5035634 these 300 state statutes have faced numerous constitutional challenges and have been upheld by the supreme court again again again and again
5035635 its about whether our daughters are going to have the same opportunities as our sons
5035636 but if they make a mistake i dont want them punished with a baby
5035637 do you think youd feel the same way had your mother decided not to have you
5035638 after forty plus million abortions since roe v wade do you think its possible that one of those babies would have grown up to discover a cure for cancer
5035639 how many of those abortions were performed because the mother would have been

5035645 she got up in the middle of the night to watch the race its been a long haul for us and i wanted to share the excitement with her
5035646 coming into the last 500 we seemed to get our rhythm and brambell said go for it we committed everything we had
5035647 it was exhausting there wasnt anything left in the end
5035648 i had been on the team since 1995 and thought i was done
5035649 basically my life was rowing and i hadnt had a chance to develop other aspects but bent believes you can have a job and still row i wasnt done with the sport i was just done with devoting my whole life to it
5035650 he was sick all week and i think it was really important for us to make sure that he didnt leave his home and his country for nothing when he was in that condition
5035651 im proud of them really proud of them the last 20 strokes

5035654 with the 3000 other shops in this town there is no reason to put up with this jerk lets go somewhere else
5035655 this restaurant served up a wonderful dinner for me and the ladies on friday night
5035656 we can expect an exciting and closely fought match between these two greatest badminton players today
5035657 once again it turns out that the real decisions in this organization are being made between berlin and paris
5035658 saying that the union will have a common policy toward russia is laughable

5035665 for the past two years crude has followed the dollar almost lock step
5035666 the strength weve seen in the dollar is almost certainly helping bring crude down at this point as you move backward it actually acts as a stimulus on the economy
5035667 as for housing starts i think everyone is expecting them to remain soft ppi wont be much of a market mover as commodities have been moving lower which makes last months numbers irrelevant

5035672 when you find a doctor that is not only professional and knowledgeable but also passionate about their practice you have struck gold my
5035673 after working in the area today i decided to grab a late lunch very early dinner and i felt like korean food
5035674 it is an honor to be with you today to mark 50 years of ministry

5035677 a challenge not to come to church sunday morning to be comfortable and refreshed but to come to church to be renewed and excited you and i belong to a god of love and thats what we need to share
5035678 have your hands been the hands of god have your lips invited anyone to church in the last month have your lips cried out for love and justice in the past year
5035679 im really excited to see the success of the church and the challenges its faced over the years
5035680 resiliency is part of island culture it is really powerful
5035681 originally when the church was founded in 1958 there were no real buildings to occupy because everything was destroyed during the liberation
5035682 the church bought three quonset huts which it bought from the navy for one dollar
5035683 what classic movies do you recommend to novices such as myself
5035684 we have gone on missions to orphanages schools and childrens hospitals and service men and women that go on these missions get the benefit of seeing first hand the importance of taking care of peoples personal needs for example food shelter and clothing before a nation can be rebuilt and stabilized
5035685 isaf missions put afghanistan and our mission in context in four dimensions and helps isaf not spend four six or even 15 months in a make believe world behind an iron curtain
5035686 for the past several weeks donations have come from all over the world
5035687 we were receiving 30 boxes a day filled with school supplies clothes shoes medical supplies toys stuffed animals snacks candy blankets and sleeping bags
5035688 it really puts things into perspective and makes you appreciate everything you have in life
5035689 being able to see a smile on the faces of the children made it all worth it to me
5035690 the fact the refugees were going to benefit from the many things we distributed was satisfying
5035691 we are the gift our love for these people and our actions
5035692 when i go back home to the states there is no way i can ignore the need here in afghanistan
5035693 after 31 missions we have been able to take a total of 440 military personnel from 14 different nations outside the wire
5035694 humanity humility and harmony are three words that should unite us at isaf we have made a huge difference and together we can change the world
5035695 this is the first drug of its kind in the world and the implications are enormous
5035696 if this comes to fruition and were confident with the results so far it would be up there with the cervical cancer vaccine gardasil even bigger
5035697 it would be the biggest blockbuster since blood pressure lowering drugs
5035698 thats right sometimes it has been closed for 3 weeks
5035699 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

5035701 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5035702 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5035703 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5035704 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5035705 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5035729 100 in one test but that doesnt mean you are the best
5035730 100 and themselves and suddenly they grow up and request for more challenge
5035731 100 doesnt mean you are good for the current work you still need to prove that you are ready for more challenge for getting more and more
5035732 we are still absolutely committed to looking at international opportunities
5035733 are we absolutely committed to the idea and format we talked about last february no because we said wed take a year to look at it and were still looking at it
5035734 game 39 was the book end and everything back from that is worth exploring
5035735 the idea of playing a league game abroad still has to be a possibility but whether it happens in my lifetime who knows
5035736 but if we dont others will it happens in other sports like the nfl and baseball
5035737 we could be over taken by other nations were strong at the minute but there are opportunities we must look at
5035738 the window cant close soon enough as far as i am concerned because if he carries on playing like that it wont be long before a lot of clubs are after him
5035739 i was trying to sign mathieu flamini for birmingham at the time and had agreed a deal with arsenal but he didnt want to come
5035740 but then arsene phoned me and told me about a player he had on trial
5035741 we just wanted to play as well as we can we wanted to start all guns blazing
5035742 last year we had a difficult start and the football we played in the first half today was top drawer
5035743 we can build on that the first half was as good as we can play
5035744 having not won anything last year we go in to this season with a real determination and i think we showed that
5035745 i have to check on the form before the qualifiers but experimenting is finished
5035746 it is an important game because i hope to get the answers from the players that i hope to achieve i hope to get what i expect
5035747 when i started working with the players they were a bit scared and afraid after a lot of players played better
5035748 its not fear about me but it was soon after not qualifying and for the players it was like an examination or test it is not so
5035749 i think they know me what i ask of them about my style the movement around the pitch they know and its better now
5035750 the first and second games were different teams and it was hard enough i think they know better because at the end of the season we had 10 days together
5035751 i was really pleased with my goals especially to get them so early
5035752 and the fact that they were the ones that won the match was really nice
5035753 we are asking people who want to help their community and village to give us a call
5035754 we have been working with mayors offices to get out the word
5035755 we have also been working with the navy since theyre right down there by agat
5035756 people who have been doing this say its fun fulfilling and that they have seen the impact its had on the kids
5035757 it allows me to feel like im actually making a difference in a childs life
5035758 if its going to be for the help of the community and surrounding area then im all for it
5035759 we dont want to be sending rescuers to rescue our rescuers when they get stuck
5035760 a new site is a welcome addition to our response facilities inventory
5035761 it is important for kids to have a change of pace and scenery to release excess energy built up in the day
5035762 it is also a way for them to relieve stress
5035763 research has shown that healthy students do better in academics
5035764 the better condition they are in the better they are able to learn plus it helps with their self confidence
5035765 instead of having the kids do the standard pe routine of running sprinting up and down the court or playing the popular sports of basketball or soccer i introduce them to other sporting activities such as dancing tennis ultimate frisbee flag football and others at the same time not keeping score
5035766 the kids are hesitant about it in the beginning but when they give it a chance they end up having a good time and a good workout
5035767 we believed it would be more fiscally responsible and more prudent
5035768 guam needed its very own local dancewear store to service the rising dance community in the island
5035769 its better than the hassle of ordering online or through mail in catalogs
5035770 it saves time saves money and is very accessible our community is appreciating performing arts in dance more nowadays especially with the several dance reality shows being shown
5035771 its really hard to open a dancewear shop on guam because its a small niche community
5035772 but i put that aside if its in your heart to make a difference then do it
5035773 you need to enjoy what you do the most rewarding feeling is servicing the customers with their needs and seeing them leave the store with a smile

5035791 santos en casa es muy fuerte va a ser un duelo dif cil obviamente nosotros tenemos presi n por los ltimos resultados pero en el futbol hay revanchas y ma ana hoy la tendremos aunque sabemos que ellos tampoco han ganado y somos del mismo grupo por lo que ser un atractivo juego
5035792 estoy muy contento de venir aqu a jugar en lo personal me da nimo y motivaci n por tener una buena participaci n ganas de estar en el corona soy el capit n del equipo pero lo que importa es que el equipo gane y sume puntos
5035793 no hay presi n en el equipo por el tema del descenso ahorita estamos m s ocupados y preocupados por ganar este equipo lo ha hecho bastante bien en los tres partidos anteriores desgraciadamente no hemos podido contar con esa poca o gran fortuna de anotar goles no la hemos aprovechado pero esperamos que el domingo cambiemos la tendencia para cosechar tantos y unidades
5035794 esperamos comenzar a sumar sabemos que santos laguna es un rival complicado pero tenemos una actitud positiva que nos ayudar mucho a pesar de que ellos guerreros tienen algunas bajas no tendremos ninguna ventaja ya que se crecen m s en su estadio y ante su gente
5035795 its certainly our most successful day in olympic games history not just the fact weve got five medals but that theyre across three different sports
5035796 weve already equalled our athens haul and theres still a week to go with the potential optimistically to double that
5035797 i got home about half past one or quarter to two and to have to a whole bunch of kiwis outside our whanau house was pretty awesome
5035798 it was so late but they were still waiting up for me
5035799 still waiting for someone to tap me on and the shoulder and tell me it was a big dream it hasnt sunk in yet
5035800 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5035801 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5035802 that fraud has increased and appraisal fraud has increased in a way to exacerbate the problems
5035803 the higher the loan amount the more money brokers and lenders make in the deal
5035804 and they threaten you they say if you dont play ball with us well go somewhere else and they do ive seen my business shrink theyre all doing it its hard to stay honest
5035805 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis
5035806 we got to this point by a lack of enforcement the public has the right to expect the appraisal boards are taking care of that problem
5035807 do you know what that would have meant the net effect is it would have effectively shut down mortgage lending in that state
5035808 to take that action would have been an unbelievable disruption to the economy i wasnt going to do that
5035809 either you shut it off completely in a state or you just send letters
5035810 the threat of the atomic bomb is the only thing
5035811 they know they can keep doing what theyre doing because they can get away with it
5035812 theyre not getting punished and states arent doing more because they know regulators wont do a thing
5035813 i wasnt alone we had appraisers from all over the nation writing in and urging them to take action
5035814 resulting from inappropriate pressure being placed on real estate property appraisers to hit a certain value
5035815 people who say we should have done more dont understand how the system works
5035816 agencies just dont lobby to change things we had no interest in doing anything like that it just wasnt our area
5035817 good position to work with and others on the problem
5035818 everything related to the issue went into a black hole why i just dont know
5035819 i tried to push but nobody wanted to hear what i was saying
5035820 problem appraisals are being allowed and in some ways even encouraged by a regulatory structure that promotes lax enforcement and ineffective oversight
5035821 we are here to alert congress that the licensing system it created for appraisers is broken and needs to be fixed
5035822 but states dont have the money to hire personnel to carry out what the system was designed to do
5035823 may have been rude or said my house wasnt worth as much as i thought
5035824 just because youre disciplined that doesnt make you a bad appraiser
5035825 i may have done some technical things wrong but ive done a good job im proud of my work
5035826 why should he get super zapped for doing a lot of little things that a lot of other appraisers are doing every day but havent had complaints turned in on them
5035827 we had a phone call from st john ambulance about 2 45am
5035828 they phoned back and said things are not so good so we need to have it happen now
5035829 if you had a four wheel drive and you knew how to use it you were all right
5035830 one of the hairier moments was stopping on the hill next to these cars to check if anyone was inside and hoping the car wouldnt slide backwards
5035831 they had good quality sleeping bags theyd settled down for the night
5035832 its a good illustration that down here we rely a lot on teamwork
5035833 all my locks were locked on my gate and my buildings and no sign of entry or anything that we can tell
5035834 its looking like snow close to sea level in the east of the south island for christchurch and thatll be more the evening and overnight but dunedin and otago will probably be getting close to that during the day
5035835 its just one burst so conditions will improve from the south early tuesday
5035836 clear skies on wednesday means itll be pretty icy with snow on the ground
5035837 we are strongly advising people not to go on tracks in nelson lakes national park and that includes lakeside tracks due to the avalanche risk the weather conditions and risk of tree fall due to snow
5035838 she tried to manhandle me which is probably not a good idea
5035839 all i wanted to do was get over to the fence and give my coach a massive hug and just celebrate the moment and soak it all in
5035840 ive dedicated a lot to my parents but tonight was all about val and all about kirsten and just the hard work weve put in in the last 10 years
5035841 watched gi jane and went down to the team lounge to watch a few events
5035842 tackling impersonations is a key priority for the agency as failing to identify offenders presents a significant danger to road safety
5035843 in this case mr johal undermined the driving test system public safety and created a useful tool for id fraud the agency is very pleased that the judge sent a message to others when he said that anyone engaging in this activity should expect a prison sentence

5035848 no drinking no nothing he loved the job he was the kind of guy you wanted to have in your barracks
5035849 i was surprised in a way that the guy walked back to him
5035850 rode with the guy who shot the guy that shot charlie
5035851 its hard for me now but i just have to look forward and hopefully do better next time
5035852 i lost my two matches like this so its disappointing
5035853 overall it was a great experience next time ill just have to finish the job
5035854 i didnt win it but at the end of the day thats what sport is all about
5035855 i think hes acknowledged that military action in this particular situation is unlikely but as commander in chief he wants to make sure all options remain available to him and thats understandable
5035856 and one of the questions this crisis raises is who do you want sitting across the table from vladimir putin and people like him john mccain or senator obama
5035857 as you saw with the surge and as you see even before this crisis broke out he said last year weve got a problem we should be thinking about having russia be disinvited from the g 8
5035858 if we were georgians and the russians were invading our country and killing our people wed be in a state of war
5035859 i think barack obama has consistently demonstrated superior judgment to senator mccain on a whole host of national security issues
5035860 whether to go into iraq or not barack obama was correct how to get out of iraq the iraqis embrace barack obamas position even george bush is coming around
5035861 he was right about afghanistan finally john mccain is coming around on that he was right about engaging iran george bush has come around on that and he was right about georgia months ago he was calling for this conflict to be diffused instead the president and john mccain are so obsessed with iraq we dropped the ball if wed listened to senator obama and his judgment perhaps we wouldnt be here today
5035862 the surge has been singularly or at least very predominantly one of the main reasons for the turnaround in the war
5035863 senator mccain saw that the need for it because of his judgment his experience and wisdom senator obama to this day to this day denies the value and the strategic benefit of the surge thats a startling lack of judgment in my view
5035864 barack obama has consistently demonstrated the kind of judgment that we want in a commander in chief
5035865 hes strong hes cool hes smart thats what we need in these difficult times
5035866 the problem is first of all that the russian president has given his word several times and its not been honored by russian troops so i assume that this time russian forces are indeed going to withdraw
5035867 president bush has offered an opportunity for russia to behave as a partner offered an opportunity for russia to make a strategic choice in favor of integration into the international economic political diplomatic security structures made an opportunity for russia to finally act like a 21st century modern power
5035868 and i do think that russian behavior calls seriously into question whether russia is prepared to make that choice
5035869 in fact russia seems to want to have it both ways it wants to be part of these institutions that are so essential to the international economy and the international order and on the other hand it wants to engage in kind of soviet style behavior of intimidating and invading allies or neighbors both cant be true
5035870 all the united states has done is encouraged democratic government in georgia encouraged market based economic reforms encouraged fight against corruption and encouraged the georgians to look towards the modern institutions of the west
5035871 the united states and georgia have had a very good relationship this is a pro western pro european government that wants to be a part of those institutions
5035872 as to this particular conflict we have encouraged georgians and all parties to resolve this conflict in south ossetia and abkhazia peacefully we have supported peace plans we have supported diplomacy we have told all parties not to get involved in military conflict
5035873 georgia of course has been a state that has been westward looking has been a friend of ours we have indicated to them through cultural exchanges and other exchanges that we want to be supportive of them
5035874 but i havent seen any evidence that the united states of america has overpromised and when you look at the reactions of the two candidates senator mccain senator obama senator mccain came out saying you know this really is bullying behavior by russia against one of our friends the state of georgia senator obamas statement came out and essentially implied that were going to equally blame our friend georgia and russia and then he revised his statement two or three times but again it shows a lack of surefootedness by senator obama
5035875 let us not forget that barack obama has been calling for a resolution of these disputes for many many months now long before hostilities broke out
5035876 if we followed his advice perhaps we wouldnt be talking about this here today if the president and senator mccain werent so obsessed on an open ended commitment to iraq perhaps we would have paid greater attention to some of these issues
5035877 are you quitting on me well are you then quit you slimy fucking walrus looking piece of shit
5035878 this is a gesture to abu mazen and the palestinian people for the upcoming month of ramadan
5035879 we welcome the release of any palestinian prisoner it is considered a victory for palestinians
5035880 we ask israeli to change its conditions for releasing prisoners and we ask for the release of all prisoners without exception
5035881 palestinians see israels justice system as unfair and have elevated prisoners to hero status
5035882 israeli officials also said sundays vote was meant to send a message that abbas can make progress through peaceful means in contrast to his opponents efforts to use force and abductions against the jewish state
5035883 weve come to a mutual conclusion on what we shall present to the leaders of the coalition government
5035884 once they have cleared it we will be presenting it as part of a resolution and charge sheet in the joint houses and god willing that should happen this week
5035885 president musharraf says he will not bow to these pressures will not quit and will defend himself
5035886 we want stability in the country we want political stability we want to make progress in the light of the mandate that has been given to our government

5035889 now justin theraux who wrote tropic thunder is writing it and jon and i are working on the story with him its pretty great and i think its going to be cool i think its going to appropriately well thought out so that we dont forget what got us the response that we appreciated so much which is we didnt say great now that this is like this now were going to twist it and do this with it its now im not saying were going to do bits i think more of the same it is a very rich feel because it was a very simple movie if you ask me it was an origin story
5035890 my whole thing is that that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie i loved the prestige but didnt understand the dark knight didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so f king smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what f ck dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from
5035891 you know youre never too old to burn your bridges because i believe i have offended everyone
5035892 i think ive got a couple more ill burn that bridge when i come to it is my favourite phrase ive ever coined

5035894 plan change 24 is founded on the premise that plan changes and resource consent applications discretionary and non complying enabling commercial residential and visitor accommodation activities generate demand for affordable housing
5035895 that premise is flawed because development both drives and responds to growth
5035896 further there are other activities that influence demand for affordable housing
5035897 while those objectives are related they are not identical and i believe the plan change as currently structured confuses the community and workforce components which is likely to result in cross subsidy double dipping and inequitable outcomes

5036142 we saw this in a theater full of kids and there wasnt a single moment that caused spontaneous cheering
5036143 ziro the hutt is perhaps the most bizarre character ever created in the series history yes including jar jar a jabba shaped slug who wears face paint and feathers the creature speaks english rather than huttese except that he she somehow has the accent of truman capote by way of eric cartman of south park
5036144 i found it impossible to concentrate on much of anything she he was saying except to imagine that all of this would one day make for a great book entitled in cold hutt naturally
5036145 the character was so bad so incredibly awful that it was a slap to the face it is many times worse than im actually describing this character was actually too much for me
5036146 after meeting ahsoka we really understand why he killed all the younglings id have done it with my bare hands she calls him skyguy which is amazingly annoying and he calls her snips

5036196 it has been brought to my attention that everybody is a pedophile as i sit here stroking my pig on this cold christmas morning it is a time to consider the families and the children they provide for us all to eat it is time to acknowledge that every teacher who offers a helping hand to a troubled child is a pedophile every plumber who brings water to our houses does so only to pour his filthy water in to our childrens innocent mouths there are now only seventeen children left in the world as the rest have already been horrifically murdered and turned into curtains for celebrities i have gathered these precious mites especially for the consumption of the faceparty community as it is the only community in the world who has never had a prepubescent child to devour now who wants to be eaten first

5036208 it was a strange feeling as soon as i saw oscar signal to the bench i was wracked with nerves i had to come on late in the game and in a really difficult match i wanted to prove as quickly as possible that i was up to the job to give a sense of security to my team mates
5036209 for me being involved in an olympic games is priceless
5036210 ive always been mad about basketball and my brother plays professionally so to have visited the olympic village and met people like kobe bryant was incredible i had my photo taken with him and when i told my family about it they couldnt believe it that alone made this experience worthwhile
5036211 it did me a lot of good especially confidence wise
5036212 even though we had already qualified by the time we played serbia that match was crucial to helping me feel secure and prove i was up to the challenge
5036213 argentina and brazil know each other very well and yes we cant deny that theres an age old rivalry between us
5036214 we always want to beat brazil and theyll always want to beat us too its a really special match
5036215 i played against them in a south american competition and we ended up drawing 2 2
5036216 i know people are saying that theyve beaten us in several big matches recently but then again weve got a lot of players in this team who have won youth competitions havent we

5036226 nowhere in my best dreams i can imagine something like what i did this year
5036227 i know how difficult it is to win these things and especially here because you only have one chance every four years
5036228 the reason probably i won this title is because i have a fantastic time here enjoying a lot in the village that was amazing experience for me always was a pleasure to know new people no
5036229 its unbelievable for me this is the best moment in my career ill never forget it
5036230 it does mean more for me to win it with serena to share this kind of moment with your sister

5036297 our expectations going into the season were that we thought we were a playoff team
5036298 i really felt going into the season that this was the best team that i had had in my five seasons as general manager i told the team that i told the community that i told the fans that
5036299 we have experience we have an inside game we have an outside game we have some veterans we have some toughness sometimes its played itself out but there have been times weve been in games and had some things transpire and it ends up getting away from us quickly those are growing pains that weve had and we assumed would take place but not to the level it has to this point were certainly not happy with our record but when youre in the eastern conference you still feel like youve got a chance even as well under 500 as we are
5036300 it was a perfect rally for me but mikko has become a lot stronger on asphalt
5036301 this result does not mean the title is already decided
5036302 i would have preferred third but fourth on tarmac is not so bad for me
5036303 weve done some good stage times and set some good splits so if we can increase the consistency its not looking so bad for the tarmac rallies later in the season
5036304 people are different people have different chemistry i ended a relationship to be alone because i didnt want to waste someones time
5036305 make sure you put down that his name is crockzilla
5036306 the defence was just massive every time they got the ball we knocked them over and it was pretty awesome
5036307 when they did make half breaks we scrambled quite well and that effort from timmy i was probably about 90 metres away hoping he was going to get him you look up and you see that and it was just a magnificent effort and it lifts everyone it was massive psychologically
5036308 at the beginning of the game we got a couple of good hits but they came back and for a good portion of the match it was a good tussle up front
5036309 i dont know about that rule really it just means youve got to fight to stay up and help each other out and just prop guys up that are getting pulled down but it did go quite well for us
5036310 the guys are playing pretty smart footy and young sladey first five eighths colin slade is playing some good footy and getting us on the front foot
5036311 the earnings guidance is likely to be more uncertain than usual
5036312 weve had weakening passenger trends currency changes oil price volatility and some positive pacific blue announcements that should help stimulate growth on the tasman
5036313 the falling dollar would provide some lift to arrivals but its departures new zealanders travelling overseas where were quite concerned about the outlook
5036314 theyve had an ok year i guess the risk is it gets a little slower before it gets better
5036315 its not going to be as lucrative for the airport to operate two
5036316 it means i can go back into working in manchester its my expertise its what i know best
5036317 thirty five years of my life went into arbuckles its a tragedy to see that its closing
5036318 payless is my life its where i work 15 hours a day seven days a week payless will be better and bigger than arbuckles
5036319 as a monster few have been able to win over
5036320 i like the arrangement that comes about when i have only one light source and various subjects that i need to need to shoot
5036321 the lightnings direction cannot be altered so i have to stand by and either wait for it to be where it is needed or for the circumstances to shift to my advantage
5036322 if they succeed they take a bit of everyone with them to better places they recognize that and so do the people
5036323 we had a phone call from st john ambulance about 2 45am
5036324 they phoned back and said things are not so good so we need to have it happen now
5036325 if you had a four wheel drive and you knew how to use it you were all right
5036326 one of the hairier moments was stopping on the hill next to these cars to check if anyone was inside and hoping the car wouldnt slide backwards
5036327 they had good quality sleeping bags theyd settled down for the night
5036328 its a good illustration that down here we rely a lot on teamwork
5036329 im really pleased with the outcome and i think theres still a wee way to go performance wise
5036330 i think its very early days all i would say is that theres a group of young players who are going to be really special players for canterbury in the future
5036331 theres 11 colts age players and when we played manawatu we had 12 with sam whitelock in our group
5036332 theyre all learning and theyre all feeding off this little bit of energy thats been created and theyre playing against and competing against teams like auckland and otago and thats got to be good for someone
5036333 well come crashing down to earth at some point when youve got young men performance fluctuations will occur but the boys should celebrate their win
5036334 the artist is nothing without gift but gift is nothing without work
5036335 its certainly our most successful day in olympic games history not just the fact weve got five medals but that theyre across three different sports
5036336 weve already equalled our athens haul and theres still a week to go with the potential optimistically to double that
5036337 i got home about half past one or quarter to two and to have to a whole bunch of kiwis outside our whanau house was pretty awesome
5036338 it was so late but they were still waiting up for me
5036339 still waiting for someone to tap me on and the shoulder and tell me it was a big dream it hasnt sunk in yet
5036340 why no mam theres much more to see p g mo th n
5036341 im surprised its a little bit late for a trade
5036342 but for me i passed my best times in this organization
5036343 sometimes guys just have off years i think that happens its a part of the game hes certainly healthy and i think a change of scenery will help him
5036344 i think going to a pennant race will help him
5036345 i cant say enough good things about luis he took the ball for us anytime he was asked and did a phenomenal job his entire career hell be missed
5036346 theyre fighting for first place so im going to do my best to clear my mind and try to help the bullpen
5036347 he attacked the hitters i kind of expect the same thing plus hes experienced thats important
5036348 he had requested to be traded this year throughout the year
5036349 we attempted to do so by the trade deadline and just were not able to make a deal that made sense for us with a month and a half left before free agency we felt we needed to get something for him

5036359 weve taken the project costs and have done some work over the seven year implementation time frame to inflate them
5036360 each individual project will have a different inflation cost associated with it
5036361 it will be awhile we really dont have a timeline but well probably just take the funds from the previous bond issue to begin design then start construction in a few years
5036362 people might scratch their heads in these times but i definitely think its salable
5036363 good projects should sell poor projects shouldnt i will vote for that if its on the ballot the city has outgrown its facilities we really have no choice if we want to continue to have high quality staff and city services where they can function efficiently and work in an attractive environment
5036364 i dont know if this is a replacement for the conference center or if this is a complementary facility i dont know if it has water crafts and fitness our obligation to the residents is to specify what the building is and make a case for it with the community center i dont think weve done that
5036365 even though the plan for a new community center has been pared down to about two thirds its original cost estimate this is still based on an architects overblown plan for a senior center that didnt even follow the senior citizens committee recommendations
5036366 at present there is no concrete plan in place and there has been no real citizen input regarding a community center this project is too important to pursue without solid direction
5036367 rather than concentrating on providing the additional office space sorely needed by city departments the aim appears to be to create some kind of monumental facility far beyond its utilitarian requirements
5036368 that portion comes with no tax increase and i expect to see support
5036369 the advisory committee did a good job coming up with the recommendations and i think because of that the general support is going to be there
5036370 as for the city hall i dont have a clue
5036371 we will set up a speakers bureau of folks who will go out and talk to various service organizations
5036372 well put a video on channel 19 well have a brochure sent to homes in the community september and october are going to be busy
5036373 were not going to spend a lot of effort on telling people to go out and vote
5036374 our effort is going to be heres what you can expect to see
5036375 i have every intention of encouraging everyone i know to vote for it assuming the package as presented is generally consistent with what the council said it was going to do
5036376 college station is growing weve grown almost 50 percent in the last eight years were going to continue to grow and we need to sustain that growth if we want to keep up the quality of transportation parks and facilities we have to invest in the future
5036377 newcastle erm united drop two points against their rivals there
5036378 she tried to manhandle me which is probably not a good idea
5036379 all i wanted to do was get over to the fence and give my coach a massive hug and just celebrate the moment and soak it all in
5036380 ive dedicated a lot to my parents but tonight was all about val and all about kirsten and just the hard work weve put in in the last 10 years
5036381 watched gi jane and went down to the team lounge to watch a few events
5036382 its looking like snow close to sea level in the east of the south island for christchurch and thatll be more the evening and overnight but dunedin and otago will probably be getting close to that during the day
5036383 its just one burst so conditions will improve from the south early tuesday
5036384 clear skies on wednesday means itll be pretty icy with snow on the ground
5036385 we are strongly advising people not to go on tracks in nelson lakes national park and that includes lakeside tracks due to the avalanche risk the weather conditions and risk of tree fall due to snow
5036386 im the lord of the lords not the servant of the serfs
5036387 its certainly our most successful day in olympic games history not just the fact weve got five medals but that theyre across three different sports
5036388 weve already equalled our athens haul and theres still a week to go with the potential optimistically to double that
5036389 i got home about half past one or quarter to two and to have to a whole bunch of kiwis outside our whanau house was pretty awesome

5036397 i hope he intends to honor the pledge this time
5036398 the word of the russian president needs to be upheld by his forces or people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5036399 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5036400 russia will pay a price we will look seriously with our allies and bilaterally at the consequences of this russian action for russian integration
5036401 russia has already paid a price because its strategic objective of undermining the democracy of georgia of destroying its infrastructure is not going to succeed

5036406 how do you compare him to legendary finnish runner paavo nurmi to jesse owens michael is very high up there in a very elite league
5036407 and will always be an amazing accomplishment in the swimming world and also the olympics being able to have something like that to shoot for i think it made those days when you were tired and didnt want to be there and you just wanted to go home and sleep instead of work out it made those days easier
5036408 the term spitzean feat might be kind of outdated now
5036409 if you can handle eight gold medals you can handle anything
5036410 i think years and years down the road well realize more and more how amazing he is and how special he really is
5036411 he just made the pressure putt in the u s open to win it just won the tour de france and he just knocked out muhammad ali in the last round he just did all three of those things in a week
5036412 were all very proud and ill speak for myself especially to be part of something as special as this and to end this wonderful meet on such a high note
5036413 with getting emotional like i was on the awards stands those are moments and experiences that will live with me forever
5036414 theres not one single word that can express how i feel
5036415 i can say proud i can say honored i can say its a performance you want to see your child achieve
5036416 im the lord of the lords not the servant of the serfs
5036417 we danced under the leaves in the forest that was sucellus he sat at its heart but he was the branches that we walked upon the ground on which we played and wind and rain that nurtured us there was no disease and no death that he did not allow
5036418 that isnt to say that no one died our lives were long but not eternal and eventually the physical body would be laid aside to travel in more spiritual places but no one ever died by malice or accident a child jumping from branch to branch was blessed by sucellus with agility and balance but he would also find that the branch would move to catch him as well so great was sucelluss love for us that his forest cared for us as well
5036419 the black mirror what do you know of that story cewellyn
5036420 my father said that the malakim receive visions from a sea of glass that is supposed to bless anyone who looks into it to make him more virtuous but that in hell there is one that does the opposite
5036421 yes there was once a mirror as your father described but it has been destroyed now remember that during this first age as we lived in sucelluss embrace and the gentle aifons dwelt in the seas with danalin the rest of creation was at war we were bordered by vast mountains with moving rocks battle scarred plains and the sea of those only the sea was safe to travel on those few that left to explore other regions never returned
5036422 cernunnos was with us then as well and had 3 mortal wives they all bore him children and all the male children were born with the horns and hooves of their father they were powerful fighters among the ljosalfar and used to play games to test their strength the greatest was said to be gower
5036423 they were powerful sons but powerful only compared to those in the forest and the occasional aifon traveler and they believed themselves to be unbeatable they spent days watching the great beasts of the gods battle across the plains neighboring the forest envying the battle they couldnt join until the day gower defied the laws of sucellus and left the forest to see what lay on the other side of the mountains
5036424 a raid on kilmorphs lands this was once a beautiful valley filled with the wide eyed calculpech and troublesome groundhogs now only ash and broken rock remain
5036425 ahh gower do you come to join the war or to end it
5036426 i thought i would fight but i see now that sucellus was right to stay out of the godswar there is too much pain here
5036427 we can end this war but not through diplomacy only through more pain when creation itself shudders when every angel fights there will be no choice but peace
5036428 this is no prison my child gower left of his own will you cannot follow
5036429 you were always my favorite of the archangels are you as strong as they say
5036430 i only want my son i have no quarrel with you
5036431 i wish i could say that things were better but things became much worse sucellus and danalin joined the godswar and creation itself was nearly destroyed in the following weeks fortunately rather than cause that the gods came together to create the compact and agree to withdrawal from creation all because of the events begun by gower
5036432 no i dont believe so but at beltane the nations that revere cernunnos hold a wrestling celebration that is in honor of his favored son and to this day the satyrs distant children of cernunnos ally themselves to any nation that follows their great father
5036433 but it is late and more of this story will have to wait for another night
5036434 yes there are three temples in the city between the three there is a small grove with a statue of a satyr it is inside the statue
5036435 i dont think so they couldnt destroy it so they built it into a statue to hide it
5036436 im going to need another illusion and a time when no one will be in the grove
5036437 what are you doing get that wagon out of here
5036438 im so sorry the road ahead was blocked and we
5036439 i dont think were supposed to be here friend what say we try to get out to real roads
5036440 you are far to useful to be discarded after this mission if that is what you are worrying about
5036441 no i just want to explore evermore more there may be more artifacts here its supposed to have been the same location the elves once shared with sucellus
5036442 very well let me know if you find something worth stealing and we can try it again next time i want to be a grigori nobleman i have some ideas for some great insults and i can put down cernunnos at every opportunity
5036443 surely your studies keep you to long from the temple lady thessa the statue is of gower favored son of cernunnos who was killed by agares during the first age this statue was erected by the elves of that age in memory of him it is one of the oldest relics in evermore
5036444 thieves usually arent that interested in history and there are a thousand statues in evermore that would have been easier to steal is there any reason why this one would be more valuable
5036445 i hadnt done anything yet the caster released the spell before i could follow it back to him
5036446 have everyone here be brought to the barracks for questioning
5036447 no im not really religious though i do enjoy the sightes of evermore and the festival
5036448 the feather i found on the edges of your empire ive only had it for a few days and im not sure what to make of it
5036449 its the second most beautiful thing ive seen in your lands
5036450 i have troubling dreams sometimes but if i burn the incense in the room with me i dont have them
5036451 this is an ancient elven craft im surprised to see anyone with it especially a human did you buy it from someone at the festival
5036452 no i met a merchant in kingsport with it but i dont know how he got it
5036453 as i said i found it at the edge of your empire so if anything it is yours anyway it is too beautiful to be stuffed into my tunic for months on end
5036454 are you sure this wont affect the investigation at all you will still likely spend the night in jail
5036455 do you think he is a mage without magic a kidnapper without a victim an attacker without a weapon and a thief without the goods we found the wagoneer that sold the missing wagon the man he described doesnt match any of our suspects what is it you suspect about this one
5036456 i agree with devon there is something suspicious about the man that warrants more scrutiny i would have him held until we find out more
5036457 i heard that devon proposed to you at the festival dance last night i am sorry it took me so long to congratulate your betrothal
5036458 yes it was an amazing night i couldnt be happier
5036459 the guards released me they said the investigation was suspended
5036460 i mean you will be leaving evermore you will be leaving our forest you wont return
5036461 i was hoping to talk to the woman who questioned me before i left do you know where she is
5036462 her name is thessa and she is betrothed to me
5036463 i came for you this blight consumes hope it will destroy you or evermore you must get out of here
5036464 you did its a memory of an affliction that struck the forest long ago it was eventually stopped by an angel but no such angel exists to stop it now come with me
5036465 how do you know about the source of the corruption
5036466 thessa i dont know the answer to that things are revealed to me in dreams like i know that if you come with me we will be safe
5036467 have you decided on a day for our wedding yet

5036478 the attack was short sharp and deadly enough to send the georgians fleeing in humiliating panic
5036479 the western media especially cnn is feeding you complete horseshit russia did not invade georgia first
5036480 this decision clearly demonstrates everything we have said recently the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe is aimed at the russian federation
5036481 us troops on monday july 14 began military exercises near the russian border in ex soviet ukraine and were poised to launch them in georgia amid tense relations between moscow and washington a ceremony inaugurating the sea breeze 2008 nato exercise was held off ukraines black sea coast against anti nato protests and a hostile reaction from officials in russia sea breeze 2008 includes forces from armenia azerbaijan belgium britain canada denmark france georgia germany greece latvia macedonia and turkey the us georgia joint exercises will be held at the vaziani military base less than 100 kilometers 60 miles from the russian border with a total of 1 650 servicemen taking part
5036482 today people make political decisions based upon their personal philosophies and intellectual beliefs even if they are registered in a party they tend to think about the issues more and vote in a more reflective and deliberate fashion
5036483 local observers attribute the weakening of party affiliation to several factors including disillusionment with the major parties identification with candidates rather than party principles and a general breakdown in community bonds that makes younger people less likely to be joiners
5036484 according to a report by the wall street journal wal mart made it clear in mandatory meetings around the country that a democrat victory would be a disaster for its anti union business model
5036485 hes only a little guy but hes got a very big heart
5036486 the strongest part of his race last week was his last 50 metres and we didnt want to die wondering so if the opportunity arose to get around and sit outside the leader we were going to take it and thats the way it worked out
5036487 it gives mccain a bounce most social conservatives want to know that he has a faith in god but what they are looking for is where that leads him to stand on the issues

5036493 we hope the release will help strengthen the peace process
5036494 ive been able to come back into my daughters life and that was an adjustment anyway because im an alcoholic and its the first time weve really been able to share
5036495 i would hope that the conservatorship stands until the end of the year and then well sit back and evaluate where we are at the time where britney is at that time
5036496 its new for both of us she sometimes calls me 50 times a day and asks me things that light my life up but like all daughters she is very manipulative and cunning so she gets what she wants a lot
5036497 but of course who wouldnt think to make themselves as marketable as possible
5036498 so make a wish and forward this to ten people and see what happens in ten minutes

5036513 the people of belarus have a right to know what they are missing our message is that as soon as the country indicates a willingness to move towards true democracy human rights and rule of law we will be ready to enter into a full partnership with belarus within the framework of the enp the enp is a special relationship between the eu and its neighbours which supports political economic and social reform in partner countries and seeks to share the prosperity and stability enjoyed by eu member states with those on the eus borders the eu would like to build such a relationship with belarus

5036517 management has always and will be situation based in instances were there is need the principles of unity of command can be condoned while there are ones were it proves to be the best way fayol analogy of and good reserched provides a pivot for good management each principle should not be looked at in isolation
5036518 the dynamic environment we are in at present does not make it conducive to apply the 14 principles of management by henry fayol these principles should be modified to suit our modern organisations which have matrix chain of commands
5036519 interesting how over time one goes on with the business of managing without really compatmentalising ones actions i guess it goes to show the flexibility and ever changing facet of management principles the longer the checklist the more actions follow contingent theories of management i think
5036520 there is no mechanism here for management of knowledge gained i e how to get the best from an individual as their attributes increase over time point 13 may allude to it but to be fair the world has changed a lot since these principles were written many companies cannot now afford to hold staff in the specialization postion in a division of work model for ever people have to move around manage diversity amp develop maintain skills managing this needs rather different attributes and attitude from both staff and managers
5036521 its an art because it involves a specialized individual in making an organizations goals achieved its a science also because it involves the study of humans and the environment in which they live and operate and applying these in making the goals of the organization achieved
5036522 at the end mgt is a jungle there are no single theories sometimes everything works and sometimes nothing even if the fundamentals are correct
5036523 management is a systematic process of taking decisions and implementing them it consists of various functions like planning controling organizing and coordinating
5036524 management is to decide what to do and get things done
5036525 management is a lot more than the theoretical and bookish concepts it has everything to do with the situation in which a manager makes decisions considering the goals of the company at its apex where at the same time the subordinates are also not kept out of the book the manager who acieves this is the one who is following the definition of management
5036526 when contemporary management practices are critically observed it is noted that henri fayols 14 principles are evident the application of these principles in management practice to some extent brings about higher productivity despite its shortfalls
5036527 henri fayols 14 principles foundation for the contemporary management students in all management programmes and practicing managers will find it a useful tool kudos to fayol
5036528 14 princples of management by fayol are the fundamentals of managerial study many of the principles should be updated by evaluating the present environment
5036529 henry fayols 14 principles of management have helped to achieve significant role in the corporate sector as well these many roles have widely helped to understand analyse the roles of management better for instance so that one can practically incorporate these practices in an organisation for better solutions
5036530 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years

5036532 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
5036533 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
5036534 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
5036535 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race

5036538 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
5036539 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
5036540 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same

5036546 but i was seasick all the way his home was in miami he had a job spraying crops and he was up at 4am and going to bed at 7pm
5036547 so i started singing in a night club which upset him tremendously

5036556 i spent 30 years on the road sleeping in strange beds and now i have a nice home and i want to live in it i keep reading about people making comebacks but i have never wanted to make a comeback i like my life the way it is

5036617 we are ready to enforce order and go further if there is resistance from the georgian side

5036626 it is an undisguised aggression accompanied by a mass propaganda war
5036627 it all confirms our numerous warnings addressed to the international community that it is necessary to pay attention to massive arms purchasing by georgia during several years now we see how these arms and georgian special troops who had been trained by foreign and u s specialists are used
5036628 it concerns not only georgia it concerns the u s and its values we are a freedom loving country which is being attacked
5036629 we ask our friends including the u s to be mediators and try persuading russia to stop this military aggression and incursion into georgia
5036630 it is the third genocide of the ossetian people from the side of georgia and saakashvili is the main murderer
5036631 irrespective of the development of situation in south ossetia we won t stop moving to the border with georgia today they launch a military aggression against south ossetia and tomorrow it could be abkhazia it cannot go on like that
5036632 we are extremely concerned with the latest developments and we think that it is very regrettable that there has been loss of lives the most urgent thing at the moment is to calm the situation down

5036711 when you are considered an older back you still have to go out there and prove your worth
5036712 i need these games to get in game shape and to get ready for september 4 against the redskins in the regular season opener
5036713 i felt really rusty in the first preseason game so i have to continue to work hard every day at practice and in the games to hopefully get back to where i was performing last year
5036714 i consider us the best running back group in the nfl hands down
5036715 i really dont see anyone that can match us as far as what we can do as a collective group running the ball catching the ball and in pass protection
5036716 but hes a vet and he knows what to do he comes in every day to compete and be a force with the offense whether its blocking catching running or even special teams i think he plays on every special team so it just shows hes here to play and make a difference
5036717 at first it was frustrating but i got over it real fast
5036718 i knew i was contributing in different ways whether it was special teams or as the short yardage guy at the same time i was enjoying the moment we went on a run and we were winning it was just a special time for me
5036719 id rather have seven tackles on special teams and win a super bowl than rush for 1 200 and not have a winning season
5036720 im not a guy who fumbles and who has a problem fumbling all the time i made a few mistakes in training camp that i have to fix but at the same time i felt like ive done pretty well
5036721 it was difficult in the fact that i had to see my teammates go through the super bowl run
5036722 that made me want to work harder and get back and hopefully get us to that same spot we were at last year which was the super bowl
5036723 i dont think about the leg now i try to keep it out of my mind because if i do think about it then im going to try and protect it and thats not what i want to do i just want to go out there and play ball without worrying about anything
5036724 thats my main goal play 16 games every game and hopefully 20 games including the postseason
5036725 i do have a lot of friends on that team its going to be interesting to hit them wide receiver braylon edwards is like my little brother so i communicate with him a lot i have a couple of running backs there i took under my wing so ill have a chance to block them a couple of times on special teams its going to be real exciting to see

5036735 and it was a very important and serious thing that involved national interests and an order from a state leader from the politburo
5036736 it was about presenting the nations music and cultural image especially because it was as the national flag entered the birds nest
5036737 the girl shown on television had to have the most perfect voice and be perfect looking it was fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi
5036738 i have an obligation to make this explanation to the chinese audience
5036739 clever child with indeed a beautiful voice and painting and singing talents
5036740 she is a good child kind hearted cute friendly and low profile with a very calm heart she loves performing peking opera and has participated in shows on international volunteers day
5036741 its harmful to both girls and it is discomforting to know that a girl was instructed to mime while the other had no chance to show her face due to an allegedly unattractive appearance
5036742 why do we have to compromise honesty for these so called national interests
5036743 we received two orders in a row yesterday morning urging us to delete the article immediately and not to allow any publicity on this issue

5036751 mr chen disclosed in interviews that producers had pulled peiyi a seven year old beijing girl with a
5036752 we didnt expect miaoke to become so popular overnight and it would be a big embarrassment if miaoke was shaped into a singing star but later it was discovered that she had no musical talent
5036753 this is a smarter way of letting the public know something that it will know sooner or later but i dont think this thing was a big thing to start with
5036754 embarrassed that their beautiful dream of the patriotic song had burst
5036755 there were a number of candidates to sing the song and the artistic directors just picked the best voice and the best performer
5036756 you have to make sure the performance and the song are at the highest level it is a casting or a technical decision by the producer
5036757 you can have different opinions but sport is exactly the same
5036758 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing that hes going to stay on the bench
5036759 i think maybe on this one some people would believe that maybe it was not appropriate but the others would have said its fantastic because the performance was great thats what it is in sport and in life
5036760 we were very pleased with its outcome of one of the most complicated events to organise in the world
5036761 later it was discovered that she had no musical talent
5036762 they made us sign and chop a document saying we would not allow black people in during the olympics
5036763 but no one is willing to say so because well all get deported and have our business shut
5036764 we simply cant let them in during the olympics its what i was told
5036765 its the restrictions on blacks definitely happening it will all happen in 24 hours
5036766 they local police call meetings and everyone has to go or else if you dont go theyll come back and shut you down
5036767 black guys can come in and drink as long as they have valid visas
5036768 but we have been told to watch out for black guys acting suspiciously such as constantly talking on their mobile phones the aim is to crack down on drug dealing
5036769 if this is policy then it is a very bad policy more so for a country holding an olympics
5036770 uniformed public security bureau officers came into the bar recently and told me not to serve black people or mongolians
5036771 i understand that the government is trying to stop certain illegal activities but i dont think blanket discrimination is going about it the right way
5036772 chinese people are prejudiced but i would have hoped that the government would set a better example as it debuts on the world stage
5036773 the officials told me to inform my customers that they must at all times carry their passports or id cards
5036774 security is important but beijing is becoming a fortress and thats not attractive
5036775 the local police told us to get rid of the tables because theyre scared that if too many foreigners congregate outside there could be trouble
5036776 the whole music scene is angry and bewildered it is impossible to understand how keeping tourists from seeing an open culturally vibrant and diverse beijing is possibly a good thing for anyone
5036777 it appears the local government is trying to control every aspect of the experience that foreigners get when they come here
5036778 everything is aimed at creating stability but they dont understand that is precisely the unfounded prejudice that foreigners have of chinese society that it is a highly controlled and not a very cultural place it seems completely self defeating

5036791 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around the banks will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
5036792 the happy union of these states is a wonder their constitution a miracle their example the hope of liberty throughout the world
5036793 the constitution is the guide which i never will abandon

5036805 ive read that i flew up the hills and mountains of france but you dont fly up a hill you struggle slowly and painfully and maybe if you work very hard you get to the top ahead of everybody else
5036806 what is behind it is the years of passion and dedication and hard work
5036807 being near or at the top certainly requires an enormous amount of time and effort and it doesnt come without collateral cost
5036808 its not a 9 to 5 job something elsewhere is going to have to suffer
5036809 as i stood in front of all of you for years in victory i stand in front of you today
5036810 ah how could i possibly admit such an infirmity in the one sense which should have been more perfect in me than in others
5036811 soon i would have to deal with something i had not known in my entire life pressure the pressure to defend my position the pressure to carry myself like a man and champion the pressure to meet demands and obligations that came with my new station and wealth the pressure to take on the obligations that come with being a professional anything and most demanding of all the pressure to win day after day round after round to hold my new position and potentially improve on it

5037093 we in our patch have been too critical of others who dont fit into that patch
5037094 we need to be less judgmental and not get sucked into the various controversies that erupt we need to look into our businesses and make sure they are as good for art artists culture and commerce as they can be we will survive on our good performance not otherwise
5037095 examine the compatible activities and synergies of both companies as they prepare for their move to the new performing arts venue in northbridge
5037096 it could be a merger or a tight series of moves to make two companies operate with joint synergies
5037097 when you bump two theatre companies into the same space theres an obligation on their part to make things work better together
5037098 but its quite terrifying because there would be no other adult theatre company in perth and its a lot of pressure for one company to carry
5037099 how do you bolt all that together to ensure that what youre producing is worthwhile and the two companies are not falling over each other
5037100 we dont want to do anything less than what were doing now
5037101 and were not going to let west australian talent slip by if the two companies come together were consciously about creating more opportunities were looking at better theatre and a bigger theatre company
5037102 create a company of sufficient critical mass to support new and innovative west australian product for the festival circuit and build audiences with more mainstream product
5037103 the greater critical mass of a merged company increases the likelihood of attracting high calibre staff who can undertake more sophisticated box office marketing and private sector development
5037104 they havent at any time pushed or cajoled us into these discussions
5037105 our idea is to put less into administration and more into artistic capability
5037106 esiste al mondo un concetto pi fugace ed elusivo dellamore molti credono di comprendere appieno questo concetto ma ne appesantiscono lincantevole semplicit con un opprimente quantit di pregiudizi e aspettative irraggiungibili lamore fondato sullonest laltruismo e labnegazione e questa parte di me stata messa a dura prova ultimamente non so tuttavia se esista nellanimo di tutti questo concetto temo che lamore non trovi spazio in un mondo governato da oscure e infantili rivalit temo che molti ammantino quel sentimento di unaura possessiva che sconfina nella pi triste delle irriverenze questo timore la corda che mi lega una corda molto pi tangibile della pi pesante delle catene di uno stupratore tutto ci a dir poco agghiacciante immobile io non posso fare altro che accettare in silenzio questo tormento interiore che mi riduce al tremante simulacro di un bambino spaventato non dubito ne oso lamentarmi delle mie decisioni ma ora nellinesistente quiete della mia vita c omincio a credere che i desideri sgorgati dal mio cuore in quei momenti critici erano frutto dellinevitabile frenesia dellinesperienza allora non conoscevo quellesistenza tranquilla che tanto bramavo sosteniamo di anelare una comodit quando nel pi profondo del nostro cuore sappiamo che sono il dolore e le sfide a darci la vita devo ammettere almeno a me stesso che non lo so esiste dunque al mondo un concetto pi fugace ed elusivo dellamore

5037111 hace unos d as aparentemente con buena salud nada hac a pensar en algo as de inesperado me uno al duelo de los familiares y de toda la di cesis en la que era apreciado y amado por su esfuerzo y dedicaci n
5037112 al elevar al se or una fervorosa oraci n de sufragio por este nuevo servio bueno y fiel env o una especial y confortadora bendici n apost lica al hermano religioso capuchino del prelado a los dem s parientes y a todos los sacerdotes religiosos y religiosas y fieles de la di cesis de bolzano bressanone
5037113 elev sus oraciones por todas las v ctimas de este conflicto y alent la ayuda humanitaria para las poblaciones afectadas
5037114 sigo con atenci n y preocupaci n la situaci n en georgia y mi siento particularmente cercano a las v ctimas del conflicto mientras elevo una oraci n especial de sufragio por los difuntos expreso mis sinceras condolencias a cuantos est n de luto y llamo a que sean aliviados con generosidad los pr fugos sobre todo las mujeres y los ni os quienes podr an tener dificultades para obtener lo necesario para sobrevivir
5037115 de corredores humanitarios entre la regi n de osetia meridional y el resto de georgia de modo que los muertos todav a abandonados puedan recibir digna sepultura los heridos sean adecuadamente curados y puedan llegar hasta donde est n sus seres queridos que se garantice adem s a las minor as tnicas involucradas en el conflicto la seguridad y los derechos fundamentales que no pueden nunca ser conculcados
5037116 lograda gracias a la contribuci n de la uni n europea pueda consolidarse y transformar en paz estable mientras invito a la comunidad internacional a
5037117 gran responsabilidad de la comunidad eclesial llamada a ser un hogar para todos
5037118 qu importante es sobre todo en nuestros tiempos que toda comunidad cristiana profundice cada vez m s esta conciencia para poder as tambi n ayudar a la sociedad civil a superar toda posible tentaci n de racismo de intolerancia y de exclusi n y a organizarse con opciones respetuosas de la dignidad de cada ser humano
5037119 lamentablemente en diversos pa ses se registran nuevas manifestaciones preocupantes de ste vinculadas frecuentemente a problemas sociales y econ micos que no pueden justificar el desprecio y la discriminaci n racial oramos para que en todo lugar crezca el respeto por cada persona junto a la conciencia responsable de que solamente en la acogida rec proca de todos es posible construir un mundo signado por una justicia aut ntica y paz verdadera
5037120 no debemos acostumbrarnos a esta triste realidad demasiado precioso es en efecto el bien de la vida humana y demasiado indigno del hombre es morir o encontrarse inv lido por causas que en la mayor parte de los casos se podr an evitar
5037121 es necesario continu un mayor sentido de responsabilidad ante todo por parte de los automovilistas porque los accidentes se deben frecuentemente al exceso de velocidad y a los comportamientos imprudentes conducir un veh culo por las v as p blicas requiere de sentido moral y sentido c vico para promocionar este ltimo es indispensable el trabajo constante de prevenci n vigilancia y represi n por parte de las autoridades competentes
5037122 sus oraciones por el eterno descanso de quienes perdieron la vida a la vez que recuerda en sus oraciones a sus familiares y damnificados
5037123 el pudor se aprende en el hogar el pudor tambi n es un valor que se debe ense ar a los ni os no s lo a las ni as se basa en el respeto a la dignidad del cuerpo y en el derecho a la intimidad
5037124 deben procurar que tanto los hijos como las hijas tengan la privacidad que necesitan aunque esto sea muy dif cil en los departamentitos modernos
5037125 el pudor no es la verg enza de mostrar un cuerpo feo o antiest tico es el recato con el que se guarda lo sagrado lo que es expresi n de un verdadero amor
5037126 la naturaleza ha rodeado la sexualidad humana de incentivos sensibles que propician la procreaci n
5037127 el ser humano ha llegado a buscar esa procreaci n de una forma responsable dentro de un digno sentimiento de amor
5037128 el pudor es reservar para el ser amado esos incentivos sensitivos y placenteros que llevan a tener hijos el amor convierte el cuerpo humano en sagrado en d diva exclusiva para el ser amado
5037129 cuando exhibimos nuestro cuerpo sin recato sin pudor lo prostituimos porque provocamos en los dem s sentimientos hacia nosotros a los que no tienen derecho a no ser que deseemos ser propiedad p blica es decir que nos prostituyamos aunque sea mentalmente
5037130 cuando todav a son los pap s quienes eligen la ropa de sus hijos procuren no disfrazarlos de adultos ni ponerles ropa provocativa aunque est de moda cuando son los hijos quienes eligen su ropa no permitan que vistan inmoralmente y expl quenles por qu no son buenas ciertas modas
5037131 en el aprecio de su cuerpo y en la preparaci n para el amor verdadero
5037132 en realidad se trata de una orientaci n moral para la comunidad cat lica
5037133 para evitar que su forma de vestir sea un pretexto para ser intimidadas violentadas y atacadas sexualmente en una ciudad en donde la violencia de g nero forma parte de la vida cotidiana
5037134 de los pueblos afectados por el terremoto que sacudi el sur del per hace un a o
5037135 es justo que miremos a esos hermanos para pedirle a dios consuelo ayuda y esperanza evidentemente estas poblaciones requieren todas nuestras fuerzas y por eso no debemos permitir que se degrade la dignidad moral de estos pueblos hermanos cediendo a sentimientos de odio y de violencia que van apareciendo de manera ya peri dica en nuestra vida peruana
5037136 duele pensar que haya gente que no mide sus propias actitudes y palabras lo ven todo en una clave de ventaja y eso va en contra de la dignidad de nuestro pueblo
5037137 desde esta catedral primada todos los peruanos de buena voluntad volvemos nuestra mirada al sur dirigimos a dios nuestras plegarias por nuestros hermanos fallecidos en el terremoto pedimos por todos los que han sido probados por el dolor y p rdida de sus hogares
5037138 es tambi n la garant a del triunfo definitivo que dios ofrece a cada criatura celebrar la asunci n nos lleva a crecer en la esperanza de que un d a tambi n nosotros seremos elevados para llegar a la morada que jes s nos tiene preparada en los cielos
5037139 culmina la uni n progresiva de fe de esperanza de amor de servicio doloroso que se estableci entre mar a y su hijo el salvador desde el momento mismo de la anunciaci n encarnaci n mar a asunta a los cielos es la
5037140 esta fiesta nos llena de consuelo y esperanza pues significa para nosotros que mar a es imagen y comienzo de la iglesia que peregrina hacia la uni n plena y definitiva con jesucristo la uni n de mar a con cristo est en funci n de la iglesia
5037141 con mar a asunta a los cielos la iglesia comienza y alcanza su perfecci n mar a se convierte en un est mulo y un punto de referencia para quienes anhelamos permanecer unidos a cristo jes s esto nos alienta mientras nos vemos rodeados de tentaciones y peligros luchando contra el pecado y la cultura de muerte
5037142 si la asunci n es la culminaci n de las grandes cosas que dios ha hecho en mar a es tambi n la garant a del triunfo definitivo que dios ofrece a cada criatura celebrar la asunci n nos lleva a crecer en la esperanza de que un d a tambi n nosotros seremos elevados para llegar a la morada que jes s nos tiene preparada en los cielos
5037143 indiferencia c vica ciudadana que se manifiesta de una manera clara en una falta de inter s por las elecciones
5037144 nivel tico del discurso pol tico convertido en discurso enga oso cargado de insulto
5037145 est deteriorando la estabilidad social y econ mica del pa s el hecho de que algunos de los que participan en la vida p blica frecuentemente est n utilizando un lenguaje descalificador violento y confrontativo se faltar a a la responsabilidad social al crecimiento econ mico a la reconciliaci n y a la paz si se promueve la polarizaci n de la sociedad la desconfianza en la inversi n extranjera el avivamiento del odio de clases la descalificaci n el exclusivismo y la represi n
5037146 estas sombras nos interpelan y queremos aportar nuestra reflexi n creyente de la historia
5037147 un llamado para que nos abramos a un di logo sincero que tenga como objeto com n enfrentar la crisis mundial que nos hiere m s a nosotros que a otros
5037148 ocasionalmente en el ambiente social se perciben dudas sobre la transparencia en el proceso electoral
5037149 un llamado al sentido de responsabilidad de los laicos para que est n presentes en la vida p blica
5037150 participar en las elecciones no s lo es un derecho que como ciudadanos nicarag enses poseemos es tambi n una obligaci n con nuestro municipio y con la naci n
5037151 recuperar la credibilidad y devolver la confianza a los ciudadanos
5037152 es tiempo de imponerse sobre las tentadoras propuestas que surgen de las sombras del mal para doblegar las voluntades y sacar a relucir la calidad moral que hay en el interior de cada uno lo cual evitar prestarse al juego maquiav lico de la manipulaci n
5037153 comprender esa desaz n o esas dificultades que en este largo tiempo las v ctimas han sufrido me parece que lo central es estar junto a la gente
5037154 ha sido una responsabilidad de todos no me parece f cil decir si fue un ministro si fue un alcalde yo creo que es un poco la dificultad de un pa s que no tiene todav a bien organizado su sistema entonces este sistema un poco lento lleno de tropiezos dificultades subidas y bajadas me parece que nos corresponde a todos
5037155 me parece que no solamente es un problema pol tico tambi n es un problema de entendimiento entre las personas y por supuesto de dejar de lado planteamientos que son muy tentativos que son los de los pol ticos frente a una circunstancia
5037156 por todas las v ctimas por todos los que murieron por todos los familiares para pedirle a dios esa serenidad esa paz y esa posibilidad de progreso que ojal nos ayude a trabajar a todos en consonancia
5037157 las sociedades cambian cuando las personas cambian sus proyectos sus corazones y mentes
5037158 los verdaderos cambios nacen en los corazones y en las mentes de las personas
5037159 apoy monos en dios renovemos la esperanza y habr una gran renovaci n en la iglesia se llenar de juventud y de fuerza para renovar nuestro mundo tan pobre y necesitado de esperanza
5037160 tal vez la iglesia pueda parecer vieja o envejecida puede parecer cargada de a os y formada por personas de a os pero sabe la iglesia que puede desear la novedad de dios y de su amor antes de obtenerla sabe que puede amar y esperar contra toda esperanza y m s all de triunfos y de prestigios humanos
5037161 esta es su tarea para nuestro tiempo la fe se propone no se impone nuestra tarea como cristianos no es otra que avivar y alimentar la experiencia de dios la fe propiciar el encuentro con dios y anticipar entre nosotros el reino de dios
5037162 no caben apoyos sociales ni inhibiciones ni c lculos t cticos
5037163 debe proseguir su deslegitimaci n hist rica pol tica y tica de medios y de objetivos
5037164 no podemos soportar que muchos de nuestros conciudadanos sean insultados y amenazados o se hayan alejado por el agotamiento y la b squeda de seguridad
5037165 la casa com n donde convivan hombres y mujeres que han hecho opciones leg timamente diferentes
5037166 con respeto mutuo deben edificar su futuro entre todos y para todos
5037167 sobre amenazas e imposiciones injustas no se construye una sociedad digna del hombre
5037168 siempre fue inmoral y cada d a se hace m s insoportable
5037169 debe proseguir su deslegitimaci n hist rica pol tica y tica de medios y objetivos
5037170 la actuaci n conjunta decidida y perseverante de todos los amigos de la libertad del respeto a las personas y de la paz sostienen la esperanza de que los esfuerzos alcanzar n pronto su meta
5037171 un inmenso alivio para las personas amenazadas en su vida en su libertad y en sus bienes
5037172 es torturado es considerado como un burro de carga es tratado como un objeto de placer sexual que se compra y que se vende
5037173 indic el prelado en un mensaje por la fiesta de la asunci n de santa mar a al cielo
5037174 las fiestas de la virgen producen una alegr a especial en quienes nos sentimos hijos de ella
5037175 nuestro gozo pues la salvaci n de cristo afecta al hombre entero cuerpo y alma
5037176 la salvaci n de cristo no es algo plat nico espiritualista
5037177 el cuerpo humano no es la c rcel del alma no es un vestido que se muda
5037178 que se ha hecho hombre de verdad se ha convertido en lugar donde brilla la gloria de dios
5037179 el cuerpo es la epifan a de la persona est llamado a correr la misma suerte que el alma

5037236 back then things were selling quickly who knew we were going to come into a slump like this
5037237 if you get an offer in todays market youd better try to make the best of it and live with it if you can because there isnt another one waiting in the wings
5037238 probably half of the houses on the market are overpriced for what people are willing to pay for them
5037239 he priced it way too high from the get go
5037240 even though he was adjusting his price and coming down he was doing it too late and chasing the market down
5037241 the real estate agents wanted me to give my house away so they could make a sale thats how i looked at it
5037242 i wanted to make a sale too but at the right price not a giveaway
5037243 if youve gotten two or three offers at the same number thats where the market is
5037244 if it was worth 450 000 it would be selling for that
5037245 he picked everybodys brain and we were more than willing to give him advice if he would listen to it
5037246 they told me if you want to sell this house youve got to take the carpet up
5037247 youre paying agents for their advice and then youre disregarding that advice
5037248 if nobody else has snapped up this house in 12 months or longer whats going to make me want it

5037252 get the old drain board off the kitchen counter and put out a bowl of oranges
5037253 a lot of sellers right now think buyers are being greedy
5037254 theyre afraid theyre going to buy a house and have its value decline after they move in theyre afraid theyre going to get stuck in that neighborhood
5037255 theyre not going to have the courage to buy that house unless its better than the other competition on the market and its irresistible to them
5037256 even in a good market fixer uppers attract only limited offers because people just dont have the time
5037257 and people who do have the time expect a really low price
5037258 if youre on a busy street you get a lot of attention from passers by
5037259 you cant make an old house a brand new house without a massive infusion of money

5037409 but jerome was tied to that desk one day i came back to the office at 3pm because i had forgotten my stupid little hat and there he was fast asleep on the photocopier

5037414 the way the swimming continues to improve and the standard that is being set now to get it exactly right for one is tough for two is really tough and for three it becomes close to an impossible task so if someone can do it i totally take my hat off to them
5037415 for me i was able to come so close literally within millimetres of doing it over 12 years and the thing is ive got to walk away happy ive given it absolutely everything ive raced some great competitors who pushed me to my absolute max and i spent everything and left everything in the water

5037420 weve both changed and grown and we just feel like oh okay this is completion
5037421 im not interested in a vice president who i send off to go to funerals
5037422 i want somebody who is going to roll up their sleeves and be willing to work
5037423 i am aware of the enhanced importance of this issue given my age
5037424 i think its unlikely but i told senator obama im going to help him in whatever way he thinks im helpful
5037425 i want you to come to know of the concern and dedication that this woman had for islam as described by those who knew her a dedication that was manifested by way of actions that were very simple and easy yet
5037426 invite them to migrate from their lands to the land of the
5037427 where are the men why do i have to be the one standing up here and doing this work
5037428 she wrote three guides for members who wanted to teach others about islam on the groups website siddiqui explained how to run a dawah table an informational booth used at school events to educate people about and persuade them to convert to islam
5037429 imagine our humble but sincere dawah effort turning into a major dawah movement in this country
5037430 not going out of her way to be noticed by anybody or to be anyones friend she just came out here to teach us about allah and english wasnt even her first language
5037431 she shared with us that we should never make excuses for who we are
5037432 how many people in this room own more than one pair of boots
5037433 so donate them to these bosnians who are about to face a brutal winter
5037434 this is a woman who attempted to blast her way out of captivity
5037435 it was her decision as she refused to by seen by a male doctor
5037436 there remains only one obstacle from which the enemy calls him from and this is an obstacle that he must face if anyone were to be saved from this obstacle it would have been the messengers and prophets of allah and the noblest of his creation this is the obstacle of satan unleashing his troops upon the believer with various types of harm by way of the hand the tongue and the heart this occurs in accordance with the degree of goodness that exists within the believer so the higher he is in degree the more the enemy unleashes his troops and helps them against him and overwhelms him with his followers and allies in various ways there is no way around this obstacle because the firmer he is in calling to allah and fulfilling his commands the more the enemy becomes intent upon deceiving him with foolish people so he has essentially put on his body armor in this obstacle and has taken it upon himself to confront the enemy for allahs sake and in his name and his worship in doing so is the worship of the best of worshippers
5037437 if ghayrah protective jealousy leaves a persons heart his faith will follow it

5037459 the problem here is that most people are idiots and equate the bible with religion
5037460 you mean science is once again catching up with the bible
5037461 the bible is truth and the bible tells what happens truthfully
5037462 none of us know the circumstances under which the police felt threatened to the point of repeatedly using the taser
5037463 ill side with the police officers judgement on whether the force used was necessary 100 times out of 100
5037464 repeated prolonged and or continuous exposures to the taser may impair breathing and respiration particularly when the probes are placed across the chest or diaphragm
5037465 actually all cops get tazed as part of their training bet that is big news to you isnt it
5037466 and you know its sad its so many incidents in south florida with these tasers
5037467 the story linked to doesnt say anything to indicate improper behaviour by police
5037468 they tased him three different times they just kept tasing him i told the police youre going to kill that man so after they did it a third time i just walked away
5037469 and they just start tasing him and tasing him until they killed him and you know its sad its so many incidents in south florida with these tasers trigger happy tasers and theyre killing people and they try to justify it
5037470 man is born free and everywhere he is in chains

5037472 the dove descending breaks the air with flame of incandescent terror of which the tongues declare the only discharge from sin and error the only hope or the despair lies in the choice of pyre or pyre to be redeemed from fire by fire who then devised this torment love love is the unfamiliar name behind the hands that wave the intolerable shirt of flame which human power cannot remove we only live only suspire consumed by either fire or fire

5037506 but analysts say it may not be enough to solve the problems facing the company
5037507 starbucks did not give details about which locations will be closed but stephen kron of goldman sachs said he thinks the closings will be weighted to areas that have been hit the hardest by slumps in the housing industry and the broader economy
5037508 another few weary steps and there was nothing above us but the sky
5037509 to this day it thrills me to know that if i can get the program right it will always work perfectly every time just the way i told it to experiencing this thrill was the beginning of my fascination with software
5037510 theres nothing like the eureka moment of discovering something that no one knew before i wont compare it to sex but it lasts longer
5037511 my feet are still on the ground im just wearing better shoes
5037512 ive read that i flew up the hills and mountains of france but you dont fly up a hill you struggle slowly and painfully and maybe if you work very hard you get to the top ahead of everybody else
5037513 what is behind it is the years of passion and dedication and hard work
5037514 being near or at the top certainly requires an enormous amount of time and effort and it doesnt come without collateral cost
5037515 its not a 9 to 5 job something elsewhere is going to have to suffer
5037516 as i stood in front of all of you for years in victory i stand in front of you today
5037517 ah how could i possibly admit such an infirmity in the one sense which should have been more perfect in me than in others
5037518 soon i would have to deal with something i had not known in my entire life pressure the pressure to defend my position the pressure to carry myself like a man and champion the pressure to meet demands and obligations that came with my new station and wealth the pressure to take on the obligations that come with being a professional anything and most demanding of all the pressure to win day after day round after round to hold my new position and potentially improve on it
5037519 let him have that monkey on his back for the next 25 30 35 years its not an easy thing
5037520 most of my friends thought i was a lot cooler i guess
5037521 it would kind of just be nice to be a regular person again
5037522 you plow ahead and make a hit and you plow on and someone passes you then someone passes them time levels
5037523 when you think of life as a living active process i dont think its a pleasurable activity unless you have some challenge in that life no matter what it is
5037524 i think in a way that is the philosophy of life
5037525 when im with a group of kids now they just yell out thats the cooking man
5037526 i walk down the streets of san francisco and every kid recognizes me and stops me and says hello you know thats really a wonderful thing
5037527 he knows how great he is but at the same time hes very humble
5037528 hes shocked to see how people still love him and remember him you see his eyes light up and it takes him back a moment when they chant ali ali its like charging a battery up
5037529 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5037530 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5037531 that fraud has increased and appraisal fraud has increased in a way to exacerbate the problems
5037532 the higher the loan amount the more money brokers and lenders make in the deal
5037533 and they threaten you they say if you dont play ball with us well go somewhere else and they do ive seen my business shrink theyre all doing it its hard to stay honest
5037534 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis
5037535 we got to this point by a lack of enforcement the public has the right to expect the appraisal boards are taking care of that problem
5037536 do you know what that would have meant the net effect is it would have effectively shut down mortgage lending in that state
5037537 to take that action would have been an unbelievable disruption to the economy i wasnt going to do that
5037538 either you shut it off completely in a state or you just send letters
5037539 the threat of the atomic bomb is the only thing
5037540 they know they can keep doing what theyre doing because they can get away with it
5037541 theyre not getting punished and states arent doing more because they know regulators wont do a thing
5037542 i wasnt alone we had appraisers from all over the nation writing in and urging them to take action
5037543 resulting from inappropriate pressure being placed on real estate property appraisers to hit a certain value
5037544 people who say we should have done more dont understand how the system works
5037545 agencies just dont lobby to change things we had no interest in doing anything like that it just wasnt our area
5037546 good position to work with bank regulators and others on the problem
5037547 everything related to the issue went into a black hole why i just dont know
5037548 i tried to push but nobody wanted to hear what i was saying
5037549 problem appraisals are being allowed and in some ways even encouraged by a regulatory structure that promotes lax enforcement and ineffective oversight
5037550 we are here to alert congress that the licensing system it created for appraisers is broken and needs to be fixed
5037551 but states dont have the money to hire personnel to carry out what the system was designed to do
5037552 may have been rude or said my house wasnt worth as much as i thought
5037553 just because youre disciplined that doesnt make you a bad appraiser
5037554 i may have done some technical things wrong but ive done a good job im proud of my work
5037555 why should he get super zapped for doing a lot of little things that a lot of other appraisers are doing every day but havent had complaints turned in on them
5037556 there has to be effective enforcement of some sort there has to be reality to it
5037557 what are you going to do if there is pressure on appraisers how are you going to penalize someone who puts that pressure on appraisers whos going to do it whos going to enforce it they need to have that or it wont work
5037558 twelve goals in three matches and still another half to go in the man u game im so glad the footy is back

5037560 well theres a thing ashley young 8 19 still leads the ratings on the villa man city player rater although hat trick superstar gabby agbonlahor 8 06 is closing the gap id expect gabs to be in top spot before too long no one but no one is even close to those boys

5037591 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5037592 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5037593 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5037594 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5037595 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5037596 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5037597 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5037598 im lost for words it is such a relief our experience was everything we stayed sure and we got better
5037599 it is a shame they were werent here but huge thanks to them
5037600 the idea for us is to try and get it cleared up
5037601 its a chance to listen to haroon lorgat about what the situation is so all the players are fully informed knowing that the board are then going to meet on tuesday and make a decision on whether were going or not

5037613 if people are voting on experience theyre not voting for obama he should be change he should be bringing new people to washington i think governor kaine is the strongest pick and i think he will be the pick
5037614 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states i think thats the responsibility of the vice president if youre unwilling or unable to do that then i think you should defer to someone else
5037615 im certainly not going to be arguing with anybody about their perspective on that regard nor am i going to give advice to john mccain as to who he ought to choose
5037616 but lets go back to this issue about whats needed right now in the country is it judgment or experience and i frankly think that judgment comes from experience i think people who are wise and have great judgment are people who have experienced the world and understand how the world works

5037630 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5037631 it was a near perfect laboratory test sen obama flunked
5037632 the claim wrongly implies that mccain is proposing a special tax cut for oil companies he is not
5037633 people are starting to look at mccain and see how hes a real guy with real answers
5037634 its not fair its elitist and they need to practice what theyre preaching
5037635 i know i speak for every american when i say to him today we are all georgians
5037636 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5037637 all persons are by nature free and independent and have certain natural and unalienable rights among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty of acquiring possessing and protecting property and of pursuing and obtaining safety and happiness

5037640 look forward to working cooperatively with the highlands council to create affordable housing opportunities in the highlands region as required by law and in keeping with the regions ongoing municipal constitutional affordable housing obligations
5037641 the highlands act establishes a goal of identifying at least 4 of the planning area for potential tdr receiving areas unless environmental constraints limit such areas to below that goal accordingly the goal of the highlands act through the implementation of the rmp is to identify 17 776 acres of the planning areas 444 398 acres

5037644 over the last two centuries the english common law system that originally applied to new jersey waters has been incrementally modified to meet the increasing demand for water and reflect the changing value society has placed on water in new jersey the most recent changes have been to incorporate the concept of the public trust doctrine under this doctrine the waters of new jersey are viewed as the property of the state which acts as the trustees of the people
5037645 the mission of hca is to restore and protect the constitutional rights of citizens to own and use private property in the new jersey highlands area and to prevent the loss of these rights from actions of government under the guise of public benefit without appropriate compensation
5037646 government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth
5037647 nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation
5037648 i have since subjected this problem to the most powerful chess computers and i am now convinced that duchamp has given us in effect a problem with no solution
5037649 another few weary steps and there was nothing above us but the sky
5037650 to this day it thrills me to know that if i can get the program right it will always work perfectly every time just the way i told it to experiencing this thrill was the beginning of my fascination with software
5037651 theres nothing like the eureka moment of discovering something that no one knew before i wont compare it to sex but it lasts longer
5037652 my feet are still on the ground im just wearing better shoes
5037653 ive read that i flew up the hills and mountains of france but you dont fly up a hill you struggle slowly and painfully and maybe if you work very hard you get to the top ahead of everybody else
5037654 what is behind it is the years of passion and dedication and hard work
5037655 being near or at the top certainly requires an enormous amount of time and effort and it doesnt come without collateral cost
5037656 its not a 9 to 5 job something elsewhere is going to have to suffer
5037657 as i stood in front of all of you for years in victory i stand in front of you today
5037658 ah how could i possibly admit such an infirmity in the one sense which should have been more perfect in me than in others
5037659 soon i would have to deal with something i had not known in my entire life pressure the pressure to defend my position the pressure to carry myself like a man and champion the pressure to meet demands and obligations that came with my new station and wealth the pressure to take on the obligations that come with being a professional anything and most demanding of all the pressure to win day after day round after round to hold my new position and potentially improve on it
5037660 let him have that monkey on his back for the next 25 30 35 years its not an easy thing
5037661 most of my friends thought i was a lot cooler i guess
5037662 it would kind of just be nice to be a regular person again
5037663 you plow ahead and make a hit and you plow on and someone passes you then someone passes them time levels
5037664 when you think of life as a living active process i dont think its a pleasurable activity unless you have some challenge in that life no matter what it is
5037665 i think in a way that is the philosophy of life
5037666 when im with a group of kids now they just yell out thats the cooking man
5037667 i walk down the streets of san francisco and every kid recognizes me and stops me and says hello you know thats really a wonderful thing
5037668 he knows how great he is but at the same time hes very humble
5037669 hes shocked to see how people still love him and remember him you see his eyes light up and it takes him back a moment when they chant ali ali its like charging a battery up
5037670 the prime minister did not speak during our brief tribute certainly not i dont think he even looked up the snarling business of question period having just ended he was shuffling papers i tried to bring him close to me with my eyes who is this man what makes him tick no doubt he is busy no doubt he is deluded by that busyness no doubt being prime minister fills his entire consideration and froths his sense of busied importance to the very brim and no doubt he sounds and governs like one who cares little for the arts but he must have moments of stillness and so this is what i propose to do not to educate that would be arrogant less than that to make suggestions to his stillness for as long as stephen harper is prime minister of canada i vow to send him every two weeks mailed on a monday a book that has been known to expand stillness that book will be inscribed and will be accompanied by a letter i will have written i will faithfully report on every new book every inscription every letter and any response i might get from the prime minister on this website

5037673 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5037674 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5037675 that fraud has increased and appraisal fraud has increased in a way to exacerbate the problems
5037676 the higher the loan amount the more money brokers and lenders make in the deal
5037677 and they threaten you they say if you dont play ball with us well go somewhere else and they do ive seen my business shrink theyre all doing it its hard to stay honest
5037678 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis
5037679 we got to this point by a lack of enforcement the public has the right to expect the appraisal boards are taking care of that problem
5037680 do you know what that would have meant the net effect is it would have effectively shut down mortgage lending in that state
5037681 to take that action would have been an unbelievable disruption to the economy i wasnt going to do that
5037682 either you shut it off completely in a state or you just send letters
5037683 the threat of the atomic bomb is the only thing
5037684 they know they can keep doing what theyre doing because they can get away with it
5037685 theyre not getting punished and states arent doing more because they know regulators wont do a thing
5037686 i wasnt alone we had appraisers from all over the nation writing in and urging them to take action
5037687 resulting from inappropriate pressure being placed on real estate property appraisers to hit a certain value
5037688 people who say we should have done more dont understand how the system works
5037689 agencies just dont lobby to change things we had no interest in doing anything like that it just wasnt our area
5037690 good position to work with and others on the problem
5037691 everything related to the issue went into a black hole why i just dont know
5037692 i tried to push but nobody wanted to hear what i was saying
5037693 problem appraisals are being allowed and in some ways even encouraged by a regulatory structure that promotes lax enforcement and ineffective oversight
5037694 we are here to alert congress that the licensing system it created for appraisers is broken and needs to be fixed
5037695 but states dont have the money to hire personnel to carry out what the system was designed to do
5037696 may have been rude or said my house wasnt worth as much as i thought
5037697 just because youre disciplined that doesnt make you a bad appraiser
5037698 i may have done some technical things wrong but ive done a good job im proud of my work
5037699 why should he get super zapped for doing a lot of little things that a lot of other appraisers are doing every day but havent had complaints turned in on them

5037706 wir sehen keinen anlass f r ver nderungen im conti vorstand
5037707 es w re w nschenswert wenn die bahn bei der erstellung des prospekts sehr prominent auf das thema und die damit wom glich verbundenen risiken hinweist
5037708 das land nordrhein westfalen ist bereit seinen anteil an der westlb zu verkaufen der preis muss nat rlich stimmen
5037709 es finden keine kaufverhandlungen zwischen der dekabank und dem land nordrhein westfalen ber die anteile des landes an der westlb statt

5037711 georgien wird wenn es das will und das will es ja mitglied der nato sein
5037712 anyways on to the 4870x2 thing its pretty much overkill but at the same time definatley not impressive especially not for the price heat and power draw it has i dont see the x2 as the gtx280s competition i see it as two gpus in one slapped together as a last ditch effort by ati to have their crown which means absolutley squat when nvidia will just trump them once again and theyll still be low in resources despite the good sales of the 4800 series
5037713 to some people maybe but it took two of their gpus to beat one of ours we have had dual gpu cards and its feasible that it may happen again
5037714 to me a human life matters whether black or white beautiful or ugly tall or short rich or poor jew or christian or muslim or atheist sane or insane these are just labels that set us apart all have human dignity there would be no prejudice if we celebrated our similarities we all share and crave love and acceptance for who we are not as someone wants us to be it is difficult to reach out to another to love another without first loving ourselves everyone has a toothache and baggage and it keeps our love from emanating out to another person and up into the universe but when you come to realize that all we have on this earth is our time and our integrity and that we are here to serve each other we all have the capacity to become like mother teresa serving one person at a time one person hurting with a toothache at a time and it could be our spouse our child our neighbor our paper boy or that complete stranger standing over in the corner alone
5037715 of all i have received or given my daughter is the most precious of all having a family is the only gift i have ever given myself as i reflect back i often feel i will have passed through failing to have done anything worthy to deserve one line in the eons of history by many i may be remembered as a real estate agent but i want to be remembered as having given life to a child my life has been empty and meaningless until i reflect on my daughter and her mother my wife my daughter collins gave meaning to my brief tenure on this planet
5037716 how lucky i am to have found charlyn and to have chosen her out of all the choices i could have made there is no doubt i made the right choice
5037717 though i know exactly where my mother wants to be buried and that my father cringes at the thought of his body suffocating entombed in the ground we have not often spoken about death as a family i think that my father almost died in the hospital this past week and the abruptness with which i was reminded of his impending premature death struck with full force a lung transplant could extend his life another ten or fifteen years but the failure of such a major surgery seems to present the possibility of picking ones own date to die we sat huddled in the living room my mom and i on the floor my dad in his favorite chair with the dog on his lap crying grieving and finally talking about the decision that we that my father has to make
5037718 okay that all sounds fine now what can you do about my nose
5037719 dear donor family not too many people on this earth get a second chance at life i did because of a compassionate caring person in your family i was told before the surgery a new lung would improve the quality of my life but perhaps not the quantity i am so thankful to be alive for however long god grants me life i promise you i will honor your gift with my last breath thanksgiving now has a whole different meaning to me i was called to university of colorado hospital on november 23rd at 9 30 pm the surgery from 3 00 am to 8 00 am on thanksgiving put me on the road to a new life only a week before my wife was concerned i would never see 2006 after struggling for breath for ten long years especially the last six months where i had to concentrate on each breath i took the first step in the icu without supplemental oxygen was worth the struggle i now find enormous gratification in the smallest most elemental pleasures taking my first shower after surgery was heavenly waking up in my hospital bed before dawn to the most beautiful winter landscape i have ever experienced living in colorado walking at dawn in washington park when it is still so peaceful with only the soft nuzzling sounds of the geese still snoozing and a few eager squirrels darting about sharing the experience with an occasional jogger or an early riser like myself i find myself weeping for no reason at all except in finding pure joy in my new life thanks to someone who cared enough to become a donor i weep for your family in your loss what a courageous and compassionate gesture to offer part of oneself so that someone might live we are a very active family who enjoy colorado to the fullest we hiked jogged biked swam skied and traveled together until i was about fifty four when i went on oxygen twenty four hours a day since 1996 i missed so many wonderful experiences with my family but i encouraged them not to quit doing the things we once enjoyed together many times my wife and daughter came home from a hike in tears because i was not able to share in some wonderful experience they had encountered that day well now i have nothing to hold me back and a lot to look forward to at age sixty three i feel like i am twenty again in honor of the gift from your family i am exercising daily in anticipation of hiking and the many other things i can enjoy with healthy lungs i will continue to honor my lung as long as i am able by doing my part to keep your gift alive by giving back to pay the good fortune forward and to spread the word of this blessing i will always keep your loved one and your family who gave me a second chance at life in my prayers sincerely and gratefully yours dean
5037720 stuart was always my best buddy my mentor my hero my advocate and i being bashful my spokesman he was kind and gentle never teased embarrassed or was jealous of his younger brother he included me in every thing he did of all the memories i will remember him most for always being my friend and for his eternal optimism and humor
5037721 no champion has ever achieved his or her goal without showing more dedication than the next person

5037724 people come to new zealand and dont understand just how fast the weather can change
5037725 there are extremely lucky to be alive in the circumstances the chances of the rescue party finding six corpses were at least as high as finding six live people
5037726 we had to tell a number of a high end clients looking for the steep and deep that its not going to happen
5037727 our crew being reduced to what it is there may be more days coming up where we are not covered
5037728 it wouldnt take much to put it past the critical point
5037729 theres some areas where we have got good cover but in the majority of the rural towns we are short of members and those that are there have a huge workload they have to contend with
5037730 dann ist es doch v llig egal was du machst
5037731 download 1 you might think you made some sort of mistake by the dialog that pops up
5037732 i feel satisfied and happy because my team played well and we won the first game 4 0 it is important that i see my team playing well on the field and i like to see three points
5037733 i learned some things in the second half that we need to be more patient and touch the ball more we were sometimes expecting more goals but when you are winning 3 0 you need to try to change the ball and to keep the ball more
5037734 for us its not all the time about trying to go for goal but 4 0 is more important than the lessons i learned today
5037735 ive been working hard not only to be ready for the first match of the new season but to maintain my fitness right until the end of may
5037736 its in that period that the champions league and scudetto race are decided
5037737 look at cristiano ronaldo he won the premier league and the champions league maintaining a very high level for several months each season is long and tough but i dont want to miss a second of it
5037738 i can adapt to anything its true that ive never played in that type of system in italy but with ajax we always played like that with players similar to figo and mancini on the wing
5037739 lets not forget that the ability to play with different systems can be a great advantage throughout a season
5037740 a few issues happened between me and the club so i no longer play for them
5037741 those stories about me and brecia are not true my personal trainer works with brescia and i did a lot of work with him there during the off season so maybe that is where the rumours are from
5037742 but there a few offers i am studying even though i am not in a hurry i want to make the right choice at the end of it all the most important thing is that wherever i end up i will give it my absolute all
5037743 it is unfair to criticise the gfa for coach rajevacs appointment when his records show that he has achieved great things in his career
5037744 he has coached consistently over the past decade has turned small clubs into big sides and with the necessary support from all of us he will take us places
5037745 serbia is a similar terrain to africa so the unwarranted criticism can only succeed in breaking our front and kill the vision of building a formidable team
5037746 it is imperative that we show him solidarity so that we succeed in all our missions in his reign as the coach of the black stars
5037747 the team is in good spirit and we want to qualify for the 2010 world cup and possibly win the 2010 nations cup under the new coach
5037748 there is no magic formula against bratislava i just scored a nice goal and we achieved one of our two objectives of the season
5037749 if we achieve the second in bratislava we will have finished a chapter and we can start a new one
5037750 already the fact i was there at the euros seemed wrong to some people certainly the world cup is one of my objectives but i only know one way of getting there by playing well
5037751 did i ever think of leaving the national team no way after italy spain at the euros i said well see but i said it in a moment of disappointment i always want to play for the national team and i always will
5037752 theres some truth to that but both competitions are very tough certainly to win either of them being as good as other teams isnt enough you have to be better
5037753 i dont want to interfere with things that arent my business but i think we have increased our potential the team is in the right conditions to compete for the scudetto the champions league and the coppa italia well be there
5037754 americans have many fine qualities a capacity to see ourselves as others see us is not high among them

5037762 john mccain did a very good job very straight forward
5037763 i think barack obama is very likeable and emotional but he skirted the issues the evening definitely cemented my views
5037764 barack obama was just like a regular politician he didnt answer the questions i think john mccain blew him out of the ballpark
5037765 what does it mean to you to believe in christ
5037766 san francisco chronicle political writer carla maninucci writes that obama
5037767 where obama was thoughtful and cautious mccain was abrupt so abrupt in fact that his short responses meant he got to answer more questions in his hour than his rival
5037768 mccain has the advantage of just being able to say what he thinks

5037771 i am continuing as the chief minister and my government is not in a minority
5037772 congress will support him soren if he forms the government
5037773 soren could not get support in 2005 when he became the cm and could remain in office only for a week this time too there is no certainty about him getting adequate numbers
5037774 the independents have a history of switching sides at slightest pretext of political uncertainty in the state in such a situation we cannot take any position

5037780 i think this is a fabulous thing for the three of us to win the medals and for jamaica to get one two three what else can you say
5037781 we will also do well in the 4x100m relay i believe we can beat the americans
5037782 looking at whether torri edwards false started and whether the race should have been called back
5037783 definitely jamaica has it out for the u s they have very strong competitors we dominated for all the years prior to this everybody deserves their one chance in history to do well
5037784 i have confidence in my competitors and i really look forward to competing against them and getting to the finish line before them clean and drug free
5037785 anyways on to the 4870x2 thing its pretty much overkill but at the same time definatley not impressive especially not for the price heat and power draw it has i dont see the x2 as the gtx280s competition i see it as two gpus in one slapped together as a last ditch effort by ati to have their crown which means absolutley squat when nvidia will just trump them once again and theyll still be low in resources despite the good sales of the 4800 series

5037804 jadi cukup adil jika hanura menggunakan batas 15 persen bpp dengan batas ini mereka yang bisa mendapat dukungan pemilih minimal 15 persen dari bpp bisa mengeliminasi nomor urut
5037805 kader harus bisa meyakinkan rakyat bukan dengan kasak kusuk supaya mendapatkan nomor urut satu kalau hanya itu ia hanya menjadi pejuang palsu
5037806 kami nanti akan membuat semacam komitmen di antara caleg bila ada yang nomor besar meraih suara lebih besar bisa saja dilakukan pergantian antarwaktu
5037807 selama ini sebenarnya kan juga sudah dilakukan semacam itu uji kepatutan dan kelayakan tetapi tentu ini akan kami lakukan lagi
5037808 tes urine dan darah untuk mengetahui pejabat yang menggunakan narkoba juga salah satu terobosan yang kami lakukan

5037810 the orbit of steins with which rosetta will rendezvous on 5 september closing to a distance of 800 km is only known thanks to ground observations but not yet with the accuracy we would like for the close fly by
5037811 for the first three weeks of the campaign however only the powerful eyes of osiris will actually be able to spot the asteroid which will look only like a dot in the sky
5037812 starting 11 days before closest approach as the distance with steins decreases the two rosetta navigation cameras will finally be able to see and track the asteroid too
5037813 we will already be able to use the first data set for the trajectory correction manoeuvre planned for mid august
5037814 as rosettas distance from steins decreases the precision of the measurements for steins orbit will increase even further allowing us the best possible trajectory corrections later on before closest approach especially in early september
5037815 but osiris will also take this opportunity to obtain light curves of steins light curves tell us how the asteroid brightness varies with time providing us with additional preparatory information about the asteroid such as better knowledge of its shape and rotation characteristics

5037819 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
5037820 whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5037821 at the moment of conception i have a 25 year pro life record
5037822 whats the most gut wrenching decision youve ever had to make
5037823 as tough a decision that ive had to make not only because there were political consequences but also because saddam hussein was a bad person and there was no doubt he meant america ill
5037824 we had a code of conduct that said you only leave by order of capture
5037825 in the spirit of full disclosure im very happy i didnt know the war was going to last for another three years or so
5037826 went against party loyalty and maybe even against your own best interest for the good of america
5037827 well ill give you an example that in fact i worked with john mccain on
5037828 and that was the issue of campaign ethics reform and finance reform
5037829 my knowledge and my background told me that a few hundred marines in a situation like that could not successfully carry out any kind of peacekeeping mission and i thought they were going into harms way
5037830 what would be the greatest moral failure in your life and what would be the greatest moral failure of america
5037831 the failure of my first marriage its my greatest moral failure
5037832 he could have avoided that altogether or come up with some other answer
5037833 but he very quickly cleanly and clearly confessed his failure
5037834 the clarity of confessing his failure there will be respect in the evangelical community for doing so
5037835 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
5037836 well i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5037837 but let me just speak more generally about the issue of abortion because this is something obviously the country wrestles with one thing that im absolutely convinced of is there is a moral and ethical content to this issue so i think that anybody who tries to deny the moral difficulties and gravity of the abortion issue i think is not paying attention so that would be point number one
5037838 at the moment of conception i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5037839 okay we dont have to go longer on that one
5037840 abortion and marriage are still pivotal issues but i think that abortion is probably more pivotal than marriage
5037841 abortion is still very very solid with this group even the younger ones who are more liberal on marriage life is a real delineating factor
5037842 i thought sen obamas statement in quoting matthew 25 which is my favorite scripture since i was in high school whatever you do to the least of my brethren you do likewise to me when as a matter of record he voted against partial birth abortion well i find it discouraging and disingenuous for him to talk about the least of our brethren
5037843 we believe in the separation of church and state but we do not believe in the separation of faith and politics
5037844 i dont happen to agree with everything either of the candidates teach or believe but they both care deeply about america theyre both patriots and they have very different views on how our nation can be strengthened weve got to learn to disagree without demonizing each other and we need to restore civility in our civil discourse and thats the goal of the saddleback civil forum
5037845 it means i believe that jesus christ died for my sins and that i am redeemed through him that is a source of strength and sustenance on a daily basis i know that i dont walk alone but what it also means i think is a sense of obligation to embrace not just words but also through deeds and expectations that god has for us and that means thinking about the least of these acting justly loving mercy and walking humbly with our god
5037846 our judeo christian principles dictate that we do what we can to help people who are oppressed throughout the world i would like to tell you that i still think that even in the worst places in the world today they still harbor this hope and dream someday to be like us and have freedom and democracy we remain my friends the most unusual experiment in history and im privileged to spend every day of my life in it i know what it is like to be without it
5037847 at what point is a baby entitled to human rights
5037848 at the moment of conception i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5037849 i am pro choice because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually rather they wrestle with these things in profound ways
5037850 one of the greatest freedoms we have here in america is the freedom of speech even the freedom to protest this meeting thats a good thing but we have to learn how to have civility in our civilization how to stop being rude how to stop demonizing each other and how to have a discussion and a debate because we all want america to be a greater place
5037851 i made the wrong assumptions as a result of his saddleback forum rick warren helped us to get a clearer picture of the candidates their moral and spiritual principles and their philosophy of government it was better than i had prayed it would be
5037852 while it is not the final word on which candidate is best christians and all americans should find this forum very helpful as they consider who they will pick to occupy the white house in 2009 rick warren didnt cover it all and we all have ideas on how we could have done it better but he did accomplish more than anyone else has so far in unpacking who the two candidates really are i applaud him

5037855 mereka perusahaan perkebunan dasarnya lemah pihak mana pun tidak boleh menempati lahan transmigrasi hanya berbekal izin lokasi dari kepala daerah

5037857 warga tetap akan menikmati hasil perkebunan selama menjadi mitra ptpn iv
5037858 lomba seperti ini lantaran keluhan kami tak pernah ditanggapi pas kebetulan peringatan 17 agustus kami adakan kegiatan ini agar pejabat pemkot medan terketuk pintu hatinya

5037860 jalur khusus ini akan diisi oleh tokoh tokoh maupun pakar yang mempunyai pengaruh termasuk di antaranya akademisi maupun tokoh muda untuk memperbaiki kualitas legislatif

5037862 mereka tetap harus berjuang untuk mendapatkan suara sebagai konsekuensi dari sistem suara terbanyak pengalaman kita ambil contoh di pilkada jateng dan jatim justru calon perempuan lebih cepat dikenal jadi akan menguntungkan juga selama ia rajin karena itu saya bilang kepada calon perempuan jangan takut

5037869 controlamos el partido a nuestro antojo y ojal que podamos seguir as
5037870 no tengo mucho que comentar sobre este partido estuvimos muy lejos de nuestro mejor nivel

5037876 este fue el primer partido en el que mostramos nuestra fortaleza porque no tuvimos presiones
5037877 en este torneo identificamos nuestros problemas eso es bueno para las m s j venes
5037878 we just have always had a relationship with the abc and we just do the sting operation at random
5037879 because of the new el segundo plaza we had a lot of new licenses we wanted to check on and the abc really wanted to focus on restaurants this time
5037880 the three employees were issued misdemeanor citations for sales of alcohol to a minor the three businesses violating the law will have a license review by the california department of alcoholic beverage control and sanctions may be taken
5037881 sometimes the person asking for the id might just be asking for the sake of the video camera to show that they checked it or maybe it has just become so routine to ask for an id that they are not really looking at it the way they are supposed to but when the id reads
5037882 they make it as realistic as possible they might go into one place and grab a six pack of beer and they might grab a bottle of alcohol at another location
5037883 i cant believe i actually won nobody expected me to win so there was no pressure
5037884 im so excited i really am i cant wait to get home

5037931 since starting this product i no longer have kidney or back pain i personally can go hours without urinating which before i swear was at least once an hour and my knees dont hurt when i get up off the toilet
5037932 its pretty clear it is a natural process of healing
5037933 we have not yet documented in a rigorous manner the health benefits of stemenhance essentially because they are so obvious and i am concerned if we get data showing the product is effective we will be in a difficult position with the fda
5037934 well we would like to subtly suggest that it works without actually saying anything definitive we cant abide in any actual testing of that proposition because that would really screw us with the government
5037935 what data do you have that this is not miracle gro for tumors
5037936 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5037937 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5037938 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

5037940 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5037941 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5037942 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5037943 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

5037945 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred

5037967 with the fall in oil and other commodity prices in the past month both the markets and fed officials had started to turn away from inflation risks and focus on growth risks
5037968 the view which we agree with is that with the usual long and variable lags falling commodity prices and rising unemployment will drive down inflation no need for the fed to get its hands dirty when the housing and
5037969 the markets are in such a forgiving mood that both the stock and rallied on thursday despite what can only be described as an ugly cpi report
5037970 the biggest problem remains the housing market and its negative impacts on the financial sector
5037971 because they failed to inform their fans or at least fans of baseball people started showing up a half hour ago only to discover theyd come for nothing
5037972 they are sorely disappointed to say the least no put it this way
5037973 i spoke to one such baseball lover uzi amit is forty seven hes a lawyer who came down from jerusalem with his four kids hes not happy and hes a lawyer uzi told me
5037974 amit told me he could see other families whod arrived and promptly left when they saw there was no game
5037975 they were also disappointed someone had told him that other families came and went he sounded very disgusted with the whole thing
5037976 said amit if these guys were serious and had more respect for their fans they would tell them whats going on and not send them on some wild goose chase its unfortunate that people who have such disregard for baseball fans are the guys trying to set up baseball in israel
5037977 frankly this is a real embarrassment because word will spread among the anglo community here that the league dissed the fans
5037978 what they can expect to pull off the rest of the week is anyones guess

5037980 president mahmoud ahmadinejad was at the lanch of the hope from irans space station
5037981 the second launch of the safir ambassador rocket carrying the first satellite omid was conducted successfully
5037982 the achievement has drawn much attention from around the world especially from among muslim nations as iran is under heavy sanctions by the west and the making it develop the technology and build every part and equipment needed in the field of aerospace
5037983 this satellite the rocket and the launch station are entirely iranian built achieved by particularly talented scientists and technicians

5037987 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5037988 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5037989 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5037990 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5037991 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5037996 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5037997 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5037998 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5037999 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

5038078 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5038079 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5038080 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5038081 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5038082 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5038083 ocorreu uma fatalidade hoje como tinha acontecido j uma fatalidade com o doda ele tinha o melhor conjunto que veio melhor nas eliminat rias e acabou que chegou aqui teve um problema e n o p de competir
5038084 o cavalo do pedro vinha muito bem tinha perdido apenas quatro pontos e ocorreu o tombo no final se n o fosse isso a gente ainda estava no jogo isso foi uma falta de sorte mas jogos ol mpicos s o assim mesmo e hoje n o foi nosso dia
5038085 estava confiante porque meu cavalo estava saltando muito bem fez uma falta que normal faz parte do jogo mas ocorreu uma fatalidade na hora do salto o cavalo n o se apoiou bem nos dois posteriores s apoiou em um e na hora em que pulou foi esse o problema quando desceu n o conseguiu se equilibrar e acabou caindo se fosse s a falta dava para seguir o problema foi que acabei caindo e eliminado
5038086 a pista estava muito dif cill aconteceram muitas faltas mas n o esperava nada diferente lamento a perda do pedro que nos impediu de classificar a equipe foi uma falta de sorte no caso do pedro mas esporte assim

5038088 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5038089 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5038090 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5038091 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5038092 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5038093 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5038094 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5038095 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5038096 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5038097 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5038098 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5038099 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5038100 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5038101 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5038102 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5038103 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5038104 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5038105 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

5038112 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5038113 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5038114 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5038115 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5038116 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5038117 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5038118 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5038119 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

5038131 what it says to us is what is happening is not a flash in the pan but there will be many potential asafa powells sherone simpsons and sherikas sherika williams because the genetic predisposition is there
5038132 the question is always there what is it nature or nurture that makes us so good the answer seems to be coming that there seems to be a strong underlying genetic or nature predisposition as to why we are able to perform like this
5038133 we have the tradition from way back from 1948 we have the talent we have the certified coaches from the very early stages they are taught the right things how to eat how to train how to sprint
5038134 i felt like the whole year away from home my coach should have been there from the start to the end
5038135 i feel like both the system and the coaching was to blame for what has happened we were in camp for a year and just did the same basic thing over and over it was limited
5038136 i felt like we didnt get shown anything new and that if my coach was there he could have straightened me out
5038137 i hope the advice he was getting from me was the same as what he was getting in the corner
5038138 i dont know if it was but i sure hope so because that is what was best for him
5038139 sometimes i would use my fathers and sometimes from the corner my father has been my coach ever since i was small so i am always going to look to him first

5038143 my sports career has been very different from other people sometimes when one is african you need discipline some people consider us lesser than europeans i dont have a sponsor i train by myself
5038144 its not the sponsorship that motivates me but i want to leave my name in the world i wonder if i could find a sponsor who could help me and recognise im a two time olympic champion
5038145 i believed in myself and i worked hard i had a baby two years ago so this is my first year back in competition i think i won because i have experience and i took my time with my preparation
5038146 my goal in the olympic games is the gold i wanted to give my best but i was not totally recovered from my injury so i am satisfied with silver

5038162 fans would always complain about how the sex wasnt authentically bisexual with just one lesbian scene one gay scene one straight scene sometimes it worked out that way but this movie is very bisexual just wait until you see that huge orgy everyone does everything to everyone
5038163 not huge numbers all at once but very consistently over time i was looking at the numbers for my older bi movies like mile bi club and fly bi night and was really surprised at how many units wed moved i knew it was time for another one

5038179 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

5038187 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5038188 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5038189 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5038190 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5038191 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5038192 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

5038209 and i saw a great and wondrous sign in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars and she being with child cries travailing in birth and pained to be delivered and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born and she brought forth a man child who is to rule all the nations and the child was caught up unto god and to his throne and the woman fled into the wilderness where she hath the place prepared of god that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days and then when the dragon saw it he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child and to the woman were given two wings of the great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent and the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood and the earth helped the woman and opened her mouth and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth and the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the saints of her seed which keep the commandments of god and have the testimony of jesus
5038210 saw and persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child and to the woman were given two wings of the great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent

5038222 youll miss those eyes in the back of your head
5038223 first of all we must say thank you to our riders and also to the teams for the work they have done over the weekend trying to help us as much as they could
5038224 obviously we are very upset with the performance of our tyres and the results we achieved today we knew it was going to be extremely difficult for our riders because we have struggled with front tyre performance since friday we therefore knew that our riders would really struggle with the front tyre during the race
5038225 now we need to understand the problems we faced here where we also struggled last year
5038226 we have to make a big improvement to our performance at tracks like brno now we will do our maximum to prepare in the best way possible for the next race at misano which is a different track and a different challenge
5038227 i dont want to be fighting at the back of the top 15 and neither does my team or yamaha and it is disappointing
5038228 all i can do is go out there with whatever i have got underneath me and give it my maximum and i did that but this team and yamaha deserve to be higher up and today wasnt good enough
5038229 i was reasonably happy with my start but i had a few moments with the front tyre on the first couple of laps and i soon realised that i was at my maximum and that i wasnt going to be able to do much more
5038230 we have got to keep working hard as a team and hope that michelin can quickly turn it around for the rest of the season so we can try and get back into that top ten and keep the morale up of the team
5038231 i was doing the same lap time over and over and i was quite happy with the pace i was running
5038232 the crash came out of the blue that corner was an easy one but i lost the front and it happened very quickly very suddenly and i didnt manage to save it its a hard one to explain and we will look at the data but sometimes this kind of crash happens at this level of racing and it was my mistake
5038233 we knew that we needed to win this race and more in order to close down valentinos advantage so this makes the championship very difficult for us
5038234 anything can happen in racing but fifty points is a big gap against such a strong and consistent competitor anyway i never throw in the towel nor does anybody at ducati and we will keep fighting until the end
5038235 im obviously disappointed for casey because after another incredible weekend its a small mistake his first in a race since hes been riding for us has cost us very dearly

5038252 we called him in and said were going to back him up to friday
5038253 we asked if he would be available sunday in relief and he said he was available saturday night if we needed him
5038254 he wanted to go another inning but i told him hed done enough

5038280 my wife met a guy from aqa a text service which promises to answer any question for a quid a couple of years ago who said he would like to work with us on something and mark said he would like to do it
5038281 we all genuinely use aqa all the time its really funny so we said we would be interested in doing something with them basically they supply us with all the questions which are sent in by people at the fringe and we pick the best ones
5038282 for example last year we had a question which was how do you make an egg bouncy the answer was to soak it in vinegar for 48 hours
5038283 we felt we should have an enjoyable mix of styles or there would be a danger of the whole thing becoming one big in joke
5038284 it also adds an element of danger when brendon burns arrived on the scene last year it got pretty interesting because were all basically quite scared of him
5038285 during one of marks long shows me and burnsy just screamed at him constantly and i ended up pretty much having a physical stand off with him this year we have jim jeffries appearing so weve just substituted one sociopathic aussie for another
5038286 it is only in edinburgh that you can get this type of audience and it is the best place to get a large audience i keep on thinking next year ill stay at home but ive been here every year since 2000
5038287 im enjoying playing the pleasance grand this year for the first couple of nights i was finding it hard to adjust to the size of the venue but since then its gone well
5038288 i started working on wordwatching three years ago in 2005 and i am already working on a show for 2010 about golf next year i think i might have a year off though i always plan well ahead with my shows because they tend to take a lot of work
5038289 it really is an exeptionally drunken show and the most unpretentious show on the fringe i really like the questions we get to ask and its a really good chance to see mark drunk on stage

5038311 the chinese people care not because they understand this particular track event
5038312 they care because they think hes going to be the winner
5038313 this is just my personal view of the country but i really believe there is something in the national psyche that desires a winner the country had been so proud and then was beaten up by other world powers it is almost like this one track race would redeem the country and thats the pressure on liu xiang
5038314 i want to be the first michael phelps not the second mark spitz never once will i ever downplay the accomplishments of spitz what he did still is an amazing feat and will always be an amazing accomplishment in the swimming world and also the olympics being able to have something like that to shoot for made those days when you were tired and didnt want to be there when you just wanted to go home and sleep and not work out it made those days easier
5038315 they are all mentally weak technically and physically they are really good there are no differences between chinese and european fencers only the chinese always feel scared
5038316 they had the integrity to wait and produce a nice record

5038321 finding statistically robust associations linked to two proteins that may be involved in regulating such ion channels and that are also thought to be targets of drugs used to clinically to treat bipolar disorder is astonishing
5038322 faced with little agreement among previous studies searching for the genomic hot spots in bipolar disorder these researchers pooled their data for maximal statistical power and unearthed surprising results
5038323 improved understanding of these abnormalities could lead to new hope for the millions of americans affected by bipolar disorder
5038324 neutralizing antibodies derived from the b cells of 1918 influenza pandemic survivors
5038325 ninety years after survivors encountered the 1918 pandemic influenza virus we collected antibody producing b cells from them and successfully isolated b cells that produce antibodies that block the viral infection
5038326 the antibodies produced by these cells demonstrated remarkable power to block 1918 flu virus infection in mice proving that even nine decades after infection with this virus survivors retain protection from it
5038327 the fact that you can isolate these anti 1918 memory b cells so long after infection will hopefully provide the impetus to further study the mechanisms behind long lived immunity
5038328 our findings show that survivors of the pandemic have highly effective virus neutralizing antibodies to this powerful virus and humans can sustain circulating b memory cells to viruses for up to 9 decades after exposure
5038329 these findings could serve as potential therapy for another 1918 like virus
5038330 even if you have lots of sequence for complex communities it still doesnt tell you which organism is responsible for which function
5038331 this publication presents an approach via simplification and targeted metagenomic sequencing of how you can go after the function in the environment
5038332 to utilize these single carbon compounds organisms employ very specialized metabolism
5038333 we suspect that in the environment there are novel versions of this metabolism and possibly completely novel pathways
5038334 it is very important for metagenomic assemblies to rely on high quality reads
5038335 the doe jgis unique integrated microbial genomics with microbiome samples img m http img jgi doe gov m data management system was used for detailed annotation and was instrumental for efficient comparative analysis and metabolic reconstruction of the samples
5038336 constitute a significant advance in the emerging discipline of metagenomics
5038337 i think other people can use the same approach in different environments as long as they have an enrichment technique
5038338 for us this work is just the beginning because now we will be using this metagenomic sequence as a scaffold for downstream experiments in our lake
5038339 the b cells have been waiting for at least 60 years if not 90 years for that flu to come around again
5038340 thats amazing because its the longest memory anyones ever demonstrated
5038341 these are some of the most potent antibodies ever isolated against a virus
5038342 the lessons we are learning about the 1918 flu tell us a lot about what may happen during a future pandemic
5038343 this work demonstrates that we can get a complete genome for a totally unknown organism
5038344 we extracted a complete genome from a very complex community and this is something novel
5038345 you can only use amplification when you know what youre trying to get and thats the problem
5038346 when you want to discover something unknown amplification is a very deficient technique because you keep discovering the things you already know so how can you discover the unknown
5038347 these are the bacteria that maintain the earths health some of the methane escapes in some parts of the lake you can see the bubbles but whatever doesnt escape as bubbles these bacteria do a very good job of eating it
5038348 this is the first time anyone has done really fundamental hands on quantum mechanics with an organic led
5038349 we can convert the spin information into a current and manipulate it and change it
5038350 we are manipulating this information and reading it out again we are writing it and reading it
5038351 even the smallest transistor today consists of hundreds of thousands of atoms
5038352 the ultimate goal of miniaturization is to implement electronics on the scale of atoms and electrons
5038353 just like a mass on a spring the pulse produces an oscillation of the spins of singlets and triplets in the organic led

5038356 it is now a strong possibility we are much closer than we were
5038357 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5038358 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5038359 that fraud has increased and appraisal fraud has increased in a way to exacerbate the problems
5038360 the higher the loan amount the more money brokers and lenders make in the deal
5038361 and they threaten you they say if you dont play ball with us well go somewhere else and they do ive seen my business shrink theyre all doing it its hard to stay honest
5038362 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis
5038363 we got to this point by a lack of enforcement the public has the right to expect the appraisal boards are taking care of that problem
5038364 do you know what that would have meant the net effect is it would have effectively shut down mortgage lending in that state
5038365 to take that action would have been an unbelievable disruption to the economy i wasnt going to do that
5038366 either you shut it off completely in a state or you just send letters
5038367 the threat of the atomic bomb is the only thing
5038368 they know they can keep doing what theyre doing because they can get away with it
5038369 theyre not getting punished and states arent doing more because they know regulators wont do a thing
5038370 i wasnt alone we had appraisers from all over the nation writing in and urging them to take action
5038371 resulting from inappropriate pressure being placed on real estate property appraisers to hit a certain value
5038372 people who say we should have done more dont understand how the system works
5038373 agencies just dont lobby to change things we had no interest in doing anything like that it just wasnt our area
5038374 good position to work with bank regulators and others on the problem
5038375 everything related to the issue went into a black hole why i just dont know
5038376 i tried to push but nobody wanted to hear what i was saying
5038377 problem appraisals are being allowed and in some ways even encouraged by a regulatory structure that promotes lax enforcement and ineffective oversight
5038378 we are here to alert congress that the licensing system it created for appraisers is broken and needs to be fixed
5038379 but states dont have the money to hire personnel to carry out what the system was designed to do
5038380 may have been rude or said my house wasnt worth as much as i thought
5038381 just because youre disciplined that doesnt make you a bad appraiser
5038382 i may have done some technical things wrong but ive done a good job im proud of my work
5038383 why should he get super zapped for doing a lot of little things that a lot of other appraisers are doing every day but havent had complaints turned in on them
5038384 there has to be effective enforcement of some sort there has to be reality to it
5038385 what are you going to do if there is pressure on appraisers how are you going to penalize someone who puts that pressure on appraisers whos going to do it whos going to enforce it they need to have that or it wont work

5038393 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5038394 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
5038395 were not selling them we give them free to the people
5038396 we didnt come to cause trouble we just came to bring bibles to help out the chinese christians
5038397 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5038398 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission
5038399 as a pastor i believe in the separation of church and state but i dont believe we can separate religion from politics because ones faith determines ones worldview which informs ones decisions and determines how one would lead the reason we are hosting this historic event is to stake out common ground for the common good
5038400 whats interesting to me about this piece is that the students all mention social factors like bias and cultural misunderstanding while all the wester researchers point to anti westernism perhaps we should listen more to what the students are saying rather than what the data might suggest they could say

5038429 you know what i would tell them is that solving big problems like for example energy is not going to be easy and everybodys going to have to all think about how are we using energy more efficiently and there is going to be a price to pay in transitioning to a more energy efficient economy and dealing with issues like climate change if we pretend like everything is free and there is no sacrifice involved then we are betraying the tradition of america i think about my grandparents generation coming out of a depression fighting world war two you know theyve confronted some challenges we cant even imagine if they were willing to make sacrifices on our behalf we should be able to make some sacrifices on behalf of the next generation

5038434 i could remember how excited i was to get it down at the record shop
5038435 i suddenly had a burst of energy and knew i had a lot more life left in me and thats when i woke up to the sound of the first song i ever bought
5038436 i would love to thank mick and the rest of the stones personally i feel they really did help wake me from my coma
5038437 you dont want me to come over there with a complaint ever

5038439 our only option left is to threaten to file an temporary injunction as our attorneys believe they are in violation of the law
5038440 hopefully the process is to spot things that would be grist for the funny mill
5038441 in some respects the heavier subjects are the ones that are most loaded with opportunity because they have the most you know the difference between potential and kinetic energy they have the most potential energy so to delve into that gives you the largest combustion the most interest i dont mean for the audience i mean for us everyone here is working too hard to do stuff we dont care about

5038445 we often discuss satire the sort of thing he does and to a certain extent i do as distillery
5038446 you have an enormous amount of material and you have to distill it to a syrup by the end of the day so much of it is a hewing process chipping away at things that arent the point or arent the story or arent the intention really its that last couple of drops youre distilling that makes all the difference it isnt that hard to get a ton of corn into a gallon of sour mash but to get that gallon of sour mash down to that one shot of pure whiskey takes patience
5038447 would be very unpleasant for most people to watch its really a gathering of curmudgeons expressing frustration and upset and the rest of the day is spent trying to mask or repress that through whatever creative devices we can find

5038451 commission to assess the threat to the united states from electromagnetic pulse attack
5038452 a single nuclear weapon exploded at high altitude above the united states will interact with the earths atmosphere ionosphere and magnetic field to produce electromagnetic pulse emp radiation down to the earth and additionally create electrical currents in the earth emp effects are both direct and indirect the former are due to electrical systems and the latter arise from the damage that shocked upset damaged and destroyed electronics controls then inflict on the systems in which they are embedded the indirect effects can be even more severe than the direct effects
5038453 the major impact of emp weapons is on electronics so pervasive in all aspects of our society and military coupled through critical infrastructures their effects on systems and infrastructures dependent on electricity and electronics could be sufficiently ruinous as to qualify as catastrophic to the nation
5038454 i mean think about it iran cuba venezuela these countries are tiny compared to the soviet union they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us you know iran they spend one one hundredth of what we spend on the military if iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance
5038455 when a country doesnt recognize the individual rights of its own citizens it cannot claim any national or international rights therefore anyone who wants to invade a dictatorship or semi dictatorship is morally justified in doing so because he is doing no worse than what that country has accepted as its social system it is improper to attack a free country because it recognizes the individual rights of its citizens

5038522 from pulitzer prize winning journalist and bestselling author ron suskind comes a startling look at how america lost its way and at the nations struggle day by day to reclaim the moral authority upon which its survival depends from the white house to downing street from the fault line countries of south asia to the sands of guant namo suskind offers an astonishing story that connects world leaders to the forces waging todays shadow wars and to the next generation of global citizens in a sweeping propulsive and multilayered narrative the way of the world investigates how america relinquished the moral leadership it now desperately needs to fight the real threat of our era a nuclear weapon in the hands of terrorists in the end he finally reveals for the first time the explosive falsehood underlying the iraq war and the entire bush presidency there are those who are all testing american values at a time of peril and discovering solutions human solutions to so much that has gone wrong

5038528 the important thing is we should also protect the player
5038529 if the player wants to play somewhere else then a solution should be found because if he stays in a club where he does not feel comfortable to play then its not good for the player and for the club
5038530 im always in favour of protecting the player and if the player he wants to leave let him leave
5038531 i think in football theres too much modern slavery in transferring players or buying players here and there and putting them somewhere
5038532 we are trying now to intervene in such cases the reaction to the bosman law is to make long lasting contacts in order to keep the players and then if he wants to leave then there is only one solution he has to pay his contract

5038549 you have to convince your government to put an end to the occupation of afghanistan so that the afghans are not killed with your hands and so that you are not killed with the hands of the afghans
5038550 the afghans did not go to canada to kill the canadians rather it is the canadians who came to afghanistan to kill and torture the afghan to please the fascist regime of america
5038551 the canadian people have to realize if their sisters their brothers and their children are being killed in afghanistan it is because of the wrong policy of the government of canada and their falling under the influence of others when they sent occupation soldiers to afghanistan
5038552 its not surprising the taliban are targeting aid workers theyre targeting their own civilians

5038606 all companies are starting to analyze the costs and trade offs of hosting

5038627 shes the hottest player on the tour at the moment it was really difficult to return her serve after losing the first set it was difficult to stay positive and keep doing the right things not getting too emotional and thinking about every point im so happy i got through it
5038628 this is for sure the biggest moment in my career in my life i will never forget this moment
5038629 its hard to believe actually i was thinking about this for a long long time and i was getting ready mentally and physically i was dreaming every day about it but when it comes to you its still a surprise its very difficult to explain the way i feel right now itll take a few days before i realize im an olympic champion
5038630 im disappointed i lost but on the other hand what ive done coming from the states winning two tournaments in a row i didnt have one normal day off i took the flight from montr al to europe from europe to here from all this scheduling matches doubles singles from what ive done i think i can be proud of myself its sad its not the gold medal but it doesnt matter because i think what ive done not many girls can do it
5038631 its just amazing that we all were able to do so well here to get three medals for our country were all very proud of it russian tennis is at a great level its at the highest level
5038632 ellen and portia came out and posed for pictures with ellens mom and their two dogs
5038633 they were hugging and kissing and looked ecstatic ellen was helping portia with the train of her dress which looked like a cinderella tutu
5038634 the whole afternoon seemed light hearted they were both laughing as they walked all over the lawn together holding hands and posing

5038637 its the first time i ever got lapped in a race
5038638 those guys are pretty good up there two of the best runners bekele and gebreselassie by far in the history of the sport its not a shame to be lapped by them but its also not a good feeling
5038639 it didnt go well today but the experience overall was great
5038640 im an olympian nobody can take that away from me i wish i could do better represent the country better
5038641 its a sport funny things happen good things happen to those who are patient and run smart and train hard and dedicate themselves one of these days it could be my day you just chalk it up to experience
5038642 those guys arent the best in the world for no reason its a good benchmark you see what you have to do i know where i need to be in four years its not really any different in any olympics theyre going to run fast and kick like crazy on the last lap its pretty simple hopefully in four years eight years the gap will be zero

5038666 a nice in depth piece from the new york times magazine on internet
5038667 this headline identifies a rather vexing issue given the ontario court of appeals reasoning in twice that preliminary drafts of expert reports are producible under the ontario rules
5038668 personal information in the adjudicative decisions of administrative agencies an argument for limits
5038669 this is a very good and timely article with a particularly detailed analysis of the issue under ontario public sector privacy legislation not online but might be worth a walk down to your library from the july 2008 issue of the
5038670 this link has been passed around for a while but i finally had a chance to read ian kerrs speech and enjoyed it it made me think that the framework for balancing of interests in privacy disputes and duty to accommodate disputes is not dissimilar iankerr ca
5038671 i would like to discuss in this issue a method of lighting which we have been using with great success and in which we have made improvements recently
5038672 in the long distant past lighting and posing of such studio photographs as fashion advertising portraiture and the like was fairly static once the lights were arranged and the camera focused the model had to maintain the pose until after the shutter was tripped photographers to gain freedom for both themselves and their models moved outdoors or created flat artificial light in the studio the only trouble with flat lighting is that while it does allow a great deal of freedom it is often hopelessly dull
5038673 for several years now we have been using the so called
5038674 the contrast of the light on the subject can be varied by the proximity of the lamp in general it is about 3 or 4 feet from the subject and usually rather high resulting in a glamorous contrasty light accentuating the shape and contour
5038675 there are however certain problems since the exposure is at best 1 60 at f 8 on tri x a small hand camera in our case a rolleiflex which can be continuously focused must be used there is also the problem of movement blur at this slow speed and a lack of depth of field
5038676 we tried various solutions such as increasing the film speed and the wattage of the lamp pushing the film caused a loss of detail in fabric textures skin tones and other areas of importance to us a larger lamp was too heavy and too hot for comfortable use high output small size quartz lamps yielded uneven light it was also too bright a source for the model to face
5038677 of course we had long realized that strobe was the ultimate solution to providing high output mobile lighting the problem with strobe was to eliminate the hot spots inherent to some degree in most strobe reflectors to maintain an equal distance from the model while both the model and the light were moving in tungsten this is not a problem because the brightness of the light falling on the model can be maintained visually to provide an accurate modeling light within the strobe so that the exact effect can be seen continuously and to obtain enough power with a short recycling time
5038678 the first was solved by using a large reflector with a double layer of spun glass for diffusion the second has been partially solved by turning off the room lights and using only the modeling light to judge relative brightness the third and fourth depended upon the strobe manufacturers in improving their product
5038679 the units which we use both the ascor 800 and the balcar do the trick although each has its problems the balcar with the large reflector has a great output 1200 watt seconds and fast recycle 3 seconds is light weight and easy to use however it uses four modeling lights which though very bright do not give an accurate preview of the exact way the flash will fall the spun glass helps in this case and if really exact aiming is important it must be remembered that the dark spot in the center of the four hot spots will become the hot spot in the picture the ascor 800 connected to one condenser unit has sufficient output and an accurate modeling light in a good reflector however leaving the modeling bulb on for long periods of time may overheat the flash tube since it is inside the tube the smaller ascor 600 has not been tried by us so i cannot comment on it there are of course other studio strobes which can be used
5038680 since the light output of any of these strobes is very great in comparison to tungsten lighting we found it practical to use a large camera 8x10 at stops such as f 64 which allowed the model to wander almost anywhere on the set and still be in focus i am speaking primarily of black and white photography although we use the same technique with ektachrome at stops like f 45 or f 32
5038681 all of our large format black and white work is done on tri x estar base film processed in kodak hc110 exposures are determined with a thomas strobemeter and we tend to overexpose slightly to compensate for the contrast of the light and to gain maximum detail in the fabric textures there will of course be small exposure variations due to the moving hand held light but these are normally covered by the high contrast of the lighting
5038682 advantages of the large format negative or transparency are obvious but if a small camera is desired this same output will allow the use of slow fine grained film with a longer tonal range on small cameras which stop down very far such as the mamiyaflex a fantastic depth of field is possible with medium speed films where neither fine grain nor depth is desired the power output can be reduced on some units thus speeding up recycle time less than 1 sec on a balcar at power
5038683 in order to put mobile strobe lighting to practical studio use it is necessary to have an understanding of basic techniques
5038684 the flash head should be mounted on its stand if this is light enough to hand hold the ascor works well on a saltzman aluminum portable stand the balcar on its own pole a large reflector should be used the largest normally supplied with the unit umbrella reflectors are awkward and should be avoided the end of the reflector should be covered with a double layer of spun glass to diffuse the light
5038685 since the photographer will have his hands full with other things it is necessary that the light be held by an assistant who is aware of lighting and knows both the photographers taste and the models probable movements the strobe power pack can be on the floor placed so that the length of the connecting wire will allow full movement all the other lights in the room should be turned off so that the only light seen is the modeling light which shows constantly what the actual photograph will look like
5038686 if you are using a white background you can either place lights directly on it to wash it out the background should read one half stop more than the subject or let it go gray from the falloff of light a nice shade of gray is obtained if the model is about 6 feet forward of the background the lamp should be 3 or 4 feet from the subject
5038687 to eliminate the shadow on the background the lamp is held rather high so that the shadow falls outside the picture area although the light can come from any angle desired one way is to keep it perpendicular to the models nose watch the shadow under the nose and the effect of light on the models cheekbones it may be helpful if the model keeps her chin up
5038688 if the garment is a dark color and detailed reproduction of it is required as in a fashion photograph keep the hot spot on the garment and overexpose slightly if it is a portrait keep the hot spot near the models eyes to stimulate the models reactions and distract her from the process of photography it is often best to play music appropriate to the feeling of the picture
5038689 if the photograph is in black and white process it for a somewhat dense negative which has the effect of cleaning up irregularities in the skin care must be taken that it does not block up
5038690 one word of precaution while holding the strobe do not touch anything that is electrified or in common circuit with the strobe this includes any other lights a fan or even the camera itself there is always the danger of shock when working with these high voltage units so this precaution must be followed

5038697 im grateful for gill hicks she didnt take revenge she did something which nobody from the muslim community has done
5038698 we shouldnt forget walktalk it wasnt just for 2008 it should go on
5038699 for me to walk from leeds to london is probably the single most difficult thing i could ever have imagined
5038700 i still cant quite believe that i have achieved it but i never gave up because of the people that never gave up on me
5038701 all of us stepped into this journey with great faith and great belief that humanity would carry us through from town to town and thats exactly what happened
5038702 for the naysayers out there that would say the lights are out the lights are very dim on sco and its only a matter of time until there are no lumens coming out of the light bulbs and the games over thats far from what the truth is
5038703 the truth is the substantial amount of investment weve put into this mobile business in the past four years its in the tens of millions of dollars is now ready to go into harvest mode
5038704 we think itll actually be a killer application in the world of mobile phones
5038705 theyre going to the organizations that rely on franklincovey and will listen to them with an open mind
5038706 they actually have a decent pedigree with regard to their technical skills
5038707 but the problem is they carry so much baggage along with their corporate name that getting somebody to take a meeting so they can pitch the product is incredibly difficult im not convinced they can ramp the volume
5038708 itll be a lot more valuable out from beneath the sco brand
5038709 we really have a lot of confidence in it its very fast its easy to use youre always connected in real time its talking to a server and its always being updated
5038710 as we move forward at some point well have to answer that question what i can say is im very committed to sco stakeholders to finish off this battle that we started five years ago we believe it is time now to go in and get things finished off
5038711 we must never underestimate the importance of our words as parents
5038712 words are powerful important significant when we speak it must be with the realization that god has given our words significance god has given our words value
5038713 faith comes from hearing and hearing through the word of christ
5038714 i value you so much that i will spend time with you in conversation
5038715 pleasant words are a honeycomb sweet to the soul and healing to the bones
5038716 reckless words pierce like a sword but the tongue of the wise brings healing
5038717 my son pay attention to what i say listen closely to my words

5038744 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5038745 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5038746 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5038747 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5038748 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5038792 a couple of u s stock funds or even just one a total stock market index fund plus a foreign stock fund and a bond fund are all most people need to cover the bases
5038793 if you have more then eight funds you should slap yourself
5038794 how many funds should you have four to six should do
5038795 as a general rule of thumb the more complexity that exists in a wall street cration the faster and farther investors should run

5038822 so we needed food on the table there were seven of us besides mother and father nine people ate a lot of food

5038834 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5038835 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5038836 that fraud has increased and appraisal fraud has increased in a way to exacerbate the problems
5038837 the higher the loan amount the more money brokers and lenders make in the deal
5038838 and they threaten you they say if you dont play ball with us well go somewhere else and they do ive seen my business shrink theyre all doing it its hard to stay honest
5038839 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis
5038840 we got to this point by a lack of enforcement the public has the right to expect the appraisal boards are taking care of that problem
5038841 do you know what that would have meant the net effect is it would have effectively shut down mortgage lending in that state
5038842 to take that action would have been an unbelievable disruption to the economy i wasnt going to do that
5038843 either you shut it off completely in a state or you just send letters
5038844 the threat of the atomic bomb is the only thing
5038845 they know they can keep doing what theyre doing because they can get away with it
5038846 theyre not getting punished and states arent doing more because they know regulators wont do a thing
5038847 i wasnt alone we had appraisers from all over the nation writing in and urging them to take action
5038848 resulting from inappropriate pressure being placed on real estate property appraisers to hit a certain value
5038849 people who say we should have done more dont understand how the system works
5038850 agencies just dont lobby to change things we had no interest in doing anything like that it just wasnt our area
5038851 good position to work with bank regulators and others on the problem
5038852 everything related to the issue went into a black hole why i just dont know
5038853 i tried to push but nobody wanted to hear what i was saying
5038854 problem appraisals are being allowed and in some ways even encouraged by a regulatory structure that promotes lax enforcement and ineffective oversight
5038855 we are here to alert congress that the licensing system it created for appraisers is broken and needs to be fixed
5038856 but states dont have the money to hire personnel to carry out what the system was designed to do
5038857 may have been rude or said my house wasnt worth as much as i thought
5038858 just because youre disciplined that doesnt make you a bad appraiser
5038859 i may have done some technical things wrong but ive done a good job im proud of my work
5038860 why should he get super zapped for doing a lot of little things that a lot of other appraisers are doing every day but havent had complaints turned in on them
5038861 the appraiser said the house was worth 114 500 so why would we sell it for 100 000
5038862 i called regularly to ask for updates but most of the time they never returned my calls finally i just gave up
5038863 the mere fact that a number of complaints have been filed against a person doesnt mean that all of the complaints reach the level of where there needs to be disciplinary action taken
5038864 im surprised its a little bit late for a trade
5038865 but for me i passed my best times in this organization
5038866 sometimes guys just have off years i think that happens its a part of the game hes certainly healthy and i think a change of scenery will help him
5038867 i think going to a pennant race will help him
5038868 i cant say enough good things about luis he took the ball for us anytime he was asked and did a phenomenal job his entire career hell be missed
5038869 theyre fighting for first place so im going to do my best to clear my mind and try to help the bullpen
5038870 he attacked the hitters i kind of expect the same thing plus hes experienced thats important
5038871 he had requested to be traded this year throughout the year
5038872 we attempted to do so by the trade deadline and just were not able to make a deal that made sense for us with a month and a half left before free agency we felt we needed to get something for him
5038873 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5038874 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open
5038875 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5038876 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5038877 we historically dont make our decisions within a 24 hour period it takes time to get everybody in a group and talk about it
5038878 companies can take control and understand their health care costs

5038880 dont quote me on this this is just what i think it is
5038881 i just hope there is no smoke damage and this is fixed up for everybody
5038882 i was very fortunate i wouldnt say lucky because no one is really lucky in this situation some of the people in the 2000 building were very fortunate that they didnt lose their stuff
5038883 we simply must do everything we can in our power to slow down global warming before it is too late the science is clear the global warming debate is over
5038884 americans are coming to understand that global temperatures have actually cooled over the last 10 years and are predicted to continue cooling over the next 10
5038885 if you look from 1995 you dont see any change that could be regarded as statistically significant for the last 13 or 14 years nothing has been happening
5038886 if you take the last 30 years its completely evident that its going up
5038887 when you make a 2 d film you use the screen as a window and you tell the story through that window
5038888 when you make a 3 d film you try to get rid of the window and the frame and transport the audience as close as possible to the filmic space if possible to the middle of the filmic space itself
5038889 you ask how are the silhouettes reading if it is two people talking you dont want them standing in front of each other
5038890 the strobing itself imposes a much slower pacing and a much more deliberate kind of staging in terms of the camera movement and even movement of the characters on the screen
5038891 but in order to keep it at fast and not beyond it actually needs a slightly slower pace or very careful blending of those shots
5038892 when you work in 2 d mono sometimes its hard to really tell how big something is especially if its not a relatable object in 3 d you can tell its the size of a mountain
5038893 graphically and in mono you kind of get the impression that its big but its an extremely impressive shot in 3 d
5038894 people are thinking what if i paint it first and then make it a sculpture later
5038895 no its not going to make a good sculpture you really have to work in the medium and really immerse yourself and the production into that
5038896 because hes african american because hes a black man who has come from a place of oppression and repression through the years in our own country president obama would be a symbol of empowerment who has the ability to help us bridge the divide of religious extremism to maybe even give power to moderate islam an important lesson for america to show egypt jordan saudi arabia other places in the world where disenfranchised people dont get anything
5038897 she touted herself as an atheist and it was something shed read about and could argue
5038898 you go into these small towns in pennsylvania and like a lot of small towns in the midwest its not surprising they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
5038899 weve got a tragic history when it comes to race in this country weve got a lot of pent up anger and bitterness the anger is real it is powerful and to simply wish it away to condemn it without understanding its roots only serves to widen the chasm of misunderstanding that exists between the races
5038900 the government lied about inventing the hiv virus as a means of genocide against people of color the government gives black people drugs builds bigger prisons passes a three strikes law and then wants us to sing god bless america no no no g d d america thats in the bible for killing innocent people g d d america for treating our citizens as less than human g d d america for as long as she acts like she is god and she is supreme
5038901 controlled by and run by rich white people racism is how this country was founded and how this country is still run we believe in white supremacy and black inferiority and believe it more than we believe in god and and and god has got to be sick of this sh t
5038902 we have supported state terrorism against the palestinians and black south africans and now we are indignant because the stuff we have done overseas is now brought back to our own front yards americas chickens are coming home to roost
5038903 white america got a wake up call after 9 11 white america and the western world came to realize that people of color had not gone away faded into the woodwork or just disappeared as the great white west kept on its merry way of ignoring black concerns
5038904 the israelis have illegally occupied palestinian territories for over 40 years now divestment has now hit the table again as a strategy to wake the business community and wake up americans concerning the injustice and the racism under which the palestinians have lived because of zionism
5038905 his depth on analysis when it comes to the racial ills of this nation is astounding and eye opening he brings a perspective that is helpful and honest
5038906 barack knows what it means to be a black man living in a country and a culture that is controlled by rich white people hillary can never know that hillary aint never been called a nigger
5038907 similar to the gospel movement in nicaragua during the whole liberation theology movement
5038908 commitment to the black community black family adherence to the black work ethic supporting black institutions pledging allegiance to all black leadership who have embraced the black values system
5038909 our roots in the black religious experience and tradition are deep lasting and permanent we are an african people and remain true to our native land the mother continent the cradle of civilization
5038910 black theology refuses to accept a god who is not identified totally with the goals of the black community if god is not for us and against white people then he is a murderer and we had better kill him the task of black theology is to kill gods who do not belong to the black community black theology will accept only the love of god which participates in the destruction of the white enemy what we need is the divine love as expressed in black power which is the power of black people to destroy their oppressors here and now by any means at their disposal unless god is participating in this holy activity we must reject his love
5038911 the time has come for white america to be silent and listen to black people all white men are responsible for white oppression theologically malcolm x was not far wrong when he called the white man the devil
5038912 this is somebody who i have known for 20 years who led me to christ he is a biblical scholar he is a well regarded preacher and somebody who is known for talking about the social gospel
5038913 i did not hear such incendiary language myself personally either in conversations with him or when i was in the pew
5038914 he has impacted the life of barack obama so much so that he wants to portray that feeling he got from rev wright onto the country because we all need something positive
5038915 if barack gets past the primary he might have to publicly distance himself from me i said it to barack personally and he said yeah that might have to happen
5038916 the destruction of u s imperialism and the achievement of a classless world world communism
5038917 this is a guy who lives in my neighborhood who i know hes not somebody who i exchange ideas from on a regular basis
5038918 i dont regret setting bombs i feel we didnt do enough
5038919 dig it first they killed those pigs then they ate dinner in the same room with them they even shoved a fork into pregnant actress sharon tates stomach wild

5038922 marx once compared revolutionary struggle with the work of the mole who sometimes burrows so far beneath the ground that he leaves no trace of his movement on the surface this is the old revolutionary mole not only showing his traces on the surface but also breaking through

5038943 a wide disconnect exists between what teens are thinking and feeling and what parents believe about their teens when it comes to attitudes about drug use
5038944 this is a pivotal opportunity for parents to understand what motivates todays teens to engage in this type of risky behavior and to communicate the very real dangers and risks while offering their kids support and guidance on dealing with pressure in a healthy way
5038945 teens continue to take their lives into their own hands when they intentionally abuse prescribed medications said pasierb
5038946 whether its to get high or deal with stress or if they mistakenly believe it will help them perform better in school or sports teens dont realize that when used without a prescription these medicines can be every bit as harmful as illegal street drugs
5038947 while teen use of illegal drugs has gone down in recent years the one category that has gone up is teen abuse of prescription drugs
5038948 americans are in denial about how widespread this problem is
5038949 we know from our research that parental engagement being involved in your kids lives monitoring what theyre up to is a very key component in teen substance risk
5038950 the appraiser said the house was worth 114 500 so why would we sell it for 100 000
5038951 i called regularly to ask for updates but most of the time they never returned my calls finally i just gave up
5038952 the mere fact that a number of complaints have been filed against a person doesnt mean that all of the complaints reach the level of where there needs to be disciplinary action taken

5038956 we got to this point by a lack of enforcement the public has the right to expect the appraisal boards are taking care of that problem
5038957 do you know what that would have meant the net effect is it would have effectively shut down mortgage lending in that state
5038958 to take that action would have been an unbelievable disruption to the economy i wasnt going to do that

5038964 i think the governments policies on the militants must be wrong or something
5038965 in some places the militants have better communication systems than the army

5038978 all of us kept telling each other we shouldnt be doing this
5038979 my mind set the whole time was why are we doing this
5038980 we immediately instituted a search for the defendant in order to absolve ourselves of liability
5038981 i got caught up in this i made a bad judgment im a screw up
5038982 asked what he did to earn an income roque reluctantly said he was a drug dealer
5038983 he said i dont fight or destroy people he said that he had a lot of friends and that they owed him
5038984 he portrayed himself as a modern day robin hood he said that he is known on the street as cuba he said that he helped people in various ways to include paying their rent and that his assistance was sometimes offered via illegal activities
5038985 roque said that he could provide information on organized crime narcotics and other illicit activity
5038986 he said that he also had information on the whereabouts of what he described as a united states army missile
5038987 detective hayes informed me and mike savant that she was going to take defendant and book him into pierce county jail
5038988 i overheard her ask one of the unknown federal officers to book defendant into jail on her behalf
5038989 liberty bail bonds personnel relinquished custody of roque to us and we were allowed to transport him to tacoma police headquarters to meet with federal agents
5038990 roque agreed to assist on the condition that he could be at home with his daughters
5038991 we explained that we could not make any promises to him and he was told that even if he didnt go to jail state charges could be filed later
5038992 a 3 5 inch bazooka rocket practice round with motor
5038993 it had a certain amount of propulsion just enough explosive material to propel it some distance for training it was not an immediate threat
5038994 i dont want to underplay the danger but its unlikely that there was an immediate danger to anybody in the neighborhood
5038995 mark came back and said to me well im not signing off on this
5038996 he told me that there was no way that he was in agreement that this was a valid surrender
5038997 in this particular case i didnt think it was worth letting go of a good bond
5038998 the surrender shall be made to the facility in which the person was originally held in custody or the county or city jail affiliated with the court issuing the warrant resulting in bail
5038999 once the bondsman surrenders the defendant at the jail the bondsman is off the hook
5039000 youve got a prosecutor who doesnt see the gray in the world
5039001 hes never worked on the other side to experience and understand the street smarts of it how things work the letter of the law doesnt necessarily incorporate the practical application of things
5039002 i wish it was only 10 000 and we could have rolled the dice and let a court of law decide but it was 150 000 and with that comes consequences
5039003 im gonna kill you you son of a bitch you touch my family ill kill you
5039004 this guy was never in one place for more than 10 minutes
5039005 i dont have any problem with anything tpd and the fbi were doing
5039006 why does the prosecutor get to let this guy walk after he admits he robbed me somewhere along the line i got screwed
5039007 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5039008 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5039009 that fraud has increased and appraisal fraud has increased in a way to exacerbate the problems
5039010 the higher the loan amount the more money brokers and lenders make in the deal

5039019 theyre not getting punished and states arent doing more because they know regulators wont do a thing
5039020 i wasnt alone we had appraisers from all over the nation writing in and urging them to take action
5039021 resulting from inappropriate pressure being placed on real estate property appraisers to hit a certain value
5039022 people who say we should have done more dont understand how the system works

5039027 problem appraisals are being allowed and in some ways even encouraged by a regulatory structure that promotes lax enforcement and ineffective oversight

5039076 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5039077 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5039078 that fraud has increased and appraisal fraud has increased in a way to exacerbate the problems
5039079 the higher the loan amount the more money brokers and lenders make in the deal
5039080 and they threaten you they say if you dont play ball with us well go somewhere else and they do ive seen my business shrink theyre all doing it its hard to stay honest
5039081 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis
5039082 we got to this point by a lack of enforcement the public has the right to expect the appraisal boards are taking care of that problem
5039083 do you know what that would have meant the net effect is it would have effectively shut down mortgage lending in that state
5039084 to take that action would have been an unbelievable disruption to the economy i wasnt going to do that
5039085 either you shut it off completely in a state or you just send letters
5039086 the threat of the atomic bomb is the only thing
5039087 they know they can keep doing what theyre doing because they can get away with it
5039088 theyre not getting punished and states arent doing more because they know regulators wont do a thing
5039089 i wasnt alone we had appraisers from all over the nation writing in and urging them to take action
5039090 resulting from inappropriate pressure being placed on real estate property appraisers to hit a certain value
5039091 people who say we should have done more dont understand how the system works
5039092 agencies just dont lobby to change things we had no interest in doing anything like that it just wasnt our area
5039093 good position to work with bank regulators and others on the problem
5039094 everything related to the issue went into a black hole why i just dont know
5039095 i tried to push but nobody wanted to hear what i was saying
5039096 problem appraisals are being allowed and in some ways even encouraged by a regulatory structure that promotes lax enforcement and ineffective oversight
5039097 we are here to alert congress that the licensing system it created for appraisers is broken and needs to be fixed
5039098 but states dont have the money to hire personnel to carry out what the system was designed to do
5039099 may have been rude or said my house wasnt worth as much as i thought
5039100 just because youre disciplined that doesnt make you a bad appraiser
5039101 i may have done some technical things wrong but ive done a good job im proud of my work
5039102 why should he get super zapped for doing a lot of little things that a lot of other appraisers are doing every day but havent had complaints turned in on them

5039169 ive read that i flew up the hills and mountains of france but you dont fly up a hill you struggle slowly and painfully and maybe if you work very hard you get to the top ahead of everybody else
5039170 what is behind it is the years of passion and dedication and hard work
5039171 being near or at the top certainly requires an enormous amount of time and effort and it doesnt come without collateral cost
5039172 its not a 9 to 5 job something elsewhere is going to have to suffer

5039174 ah how could i possibly admit such an infirmity in the one sense which should have been more perfect in me than in others
5039175 soon i would have to deal with something i had not known in my entire life pressure the pressure to defend my position the pressure to carry myself like a man and champion the pressure to meet demands and obligations that came with my new station and wealth the pressure to take on the obligations that come with being a professional anything and most demanding of all the pressure to win day after day round after round to hold my new position and potentially improve on it

5039192 weve asked our allies to provide any of the escort requirements for our chinooks and or possibly the charters in theatre
5039193 so that capability that the griffon might fulfill should be addressed by nato
5039194 im appalled that the government is not moving ahead on its own attack helicopters that would ensure we can move independently as a nation and bring our chinooks into hotspots and difficult landing areas
5039195 to me its fundamental that if were going to have half the capability which is the chinook then we should get the other half of the capability which is an attack helicopter

5039212 alterations in brain serotonin levels have been linked to several mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety

5039214 this work demonstrates that we can get a complete genome for a totally unknown organism
5039215 we extracted a complete genome from a very complex community and this is something novel
5039216 you can only use amplification when you know what youre trying to get and thats the problem
5039217 when you want to discover something unknown amplification is a very deficient technique because you keep discovering the things you already know so how can you discover the unknown

5039219 neutralizing antibodies derived from the b cells of 1918 influenza pandemic survivors
5039220 ninety years after survivors encountered the 1918 pandemic influenza virus we collected antibody producing b cells from them and successfully isolated b cells that produce antibodies that block the viral infection
5039221 the antibodies produced by these cells demonstrated remarkable power to block 1918 flu virus infection in mice proving that even nine decades after infection with this virus survivors retain protection from it
5039222 the fact that you can isolate these anti 1918 memory b cells so long after infection will hopefully provide the impetus to further study the mechanisms behind long lived immunity
5039223 our findings show that survivors of the pandemic have highly effective virus neutralizing antibodies to this powerful virus and humans can sustain circulating b memory cells to viruses for up to 9 decades after exposure
5039224 these findings could serve as potential therapy for another 1918 like virus
5039225 this is the first time anyone has done really fundamental hands on quantum mechanics with an organic led

5039228 even the smallest transistor today consists of hundreds of thousands of atoms
5039229 the ultimate goal of miniaturization is to implement electronics on the scale of atoms and electrons

5039236 la verit che non siamo ancora pronti per un simile personaggio
5039237 especially in the second half i thought our tactical kicking really stepped up and we just kept making them come out of their own 22 which is tough
5039238 theres a big improvement there and its become a big part of our game and one of the reasons that got us home
5039239 weve been working on guys looking for space and communicating it the champion that dan is you cant rely on him to make all the calls and i think hes now got good help around him
5039240 they showed tremendous courage and i think thats what won the game their courage and their fitness in the last 20 minutes
5039241 as a coach you feel very proud they had that togetherness
5039242 defence really set the attitude for us and when you make gang tackles it makes it a lot easier to get turnovers at the breakdown
5039243 with 15 to go you could feel we were getting on top of them we were playing in the right part of the field and putting them under pressure in their own half so you could feel the momentum swing our way
5039244 we dropped a little bit of ball but so did they
5039245 throughout the year particularly earlier in the year if we had have done that we would have had a try scored against us but tonight it goes to show the difference in attitude between now and then
5039246 it was pretty important before halftime because i thought we were struggling a bit
5039247 halftime was pretty good for us but having said that i still thought the majority of the game we controlled things reasonably well
5039248 i think we have plenty of steam in our outside backs and im sure they would look forward to some dry footy but it doesnt worry us at the moment
5039249 it was a poor game and the skill level was low
5039250 they gave us the opportunity in the first 20 minutes of the second half and we werent good enough to take it
5039251 the depth and magnitude of the job losses are accelerating clearly
5039252 these market leading projects we have in california are something that can be extrapolated around the world
5039253 perhaps a typical firstup performance of the season but well take the point were happy to come away with a point
5039254 i think we were a better team we created a few chances but we couldnt finish them off
5039255 the mistake in the past was expecting the talent of the team to get us through and clearly that is not enough to win the air nz cup
5039256 that is part of the approach i have taken as the coach and the players have bought into that
5039257 it was a bit of a punt and it paid off
5039258 we had a lot of youthful energy mixed in with the experienced players and thats probably what has taken us to a new level
5039259 as an ex league player im loving it and i think all the guys are
5039260 the good thing about south african and new zealand rugby is that kids grow up picking up a ball and running with it i thought today was a great advertisement for the way the games played
5039261 at my age i never dreamed a few years ago that i would still be playing the game for my country
5039262 to me its just a thorough enjoyment i ran out today and the crowd sung the south african anthem and we did the haka it was awesome this is what you dream about
5039263 obviously it was bad enough to come off yesterday and with injuries like that it usually takes about 48 hours for them to settle or get worse
5039264 hes got a big flight we have to manage it to ensure he gets plenty of ice on it on the way home if we keep the swelling down then he shouldnt be out for too long
5039265 they appear to be better today than they were yesterday so its encouraging
5039266 we wont know until we get home how he is
5039267 make sure you put down that his name is crockzilla
5039268 the defence was just massive every time they got the ball we knocked them over and it was pretty awesome
5039269 when they did make half breaks we scrambled quite well and that effort from timmy i was probably about 90 metres away hoping he was going to get him you look up and you see that and it was just a magnificent effort and it lifts everyone it was massive psychologically
5039270 at the beginning of the game we got a couple of good hits but they came back and for a good portion of the match it was a good tussle up front
5039271 i dont know about that rule really it just means youve got to fight to stay up and help each other out and just prop guys up that are getting pulled down but it did go quite well for us
5039272 the guys are playing pretty smart footy and young sladey first five eighths colin slade is playing some good footy and getting us on the front foot
5039273 im really proud of them for all sorts of reasons but its been a hell of week i can tell you that and the pleasing part of it is that under all the pressure they stood up
5039274 i thought collectively the guys really responded well and played for each other in that second half which made the difference i believe
5039275 i dont think its going to come easy tomorrow night thats for sure
5039276 the last time we met wests tigers they were a bit light on weve got to be mindful that were not meeting the same team this time around and theyve got a bit more to play for as well as do we
5039277 feleti gives us a bit more balance in there and im quite happy with the way kris keating and brett finch are combining together
5039278 there was always the thinking that kris keating would come into the side for some part of this year
5039279 when we spoke to him about being here for the next couple of years we had to convince him there was opportunity for him to be at six and feleti to go to 13 its probably just worked out that way a little bit earlier but hes handling it pretty well

5039493 manchmal glaube ich sogar s chtig nach solchen situationen zu sein in denen ich selber aufrichtig sein muss und fehler zugeben oder gef hle gestehen da is irgendwie n gewisser kick dabei adrenalin oder so was
5039494 ich bin nicht unfreundlich ich bin nur ehrlich und direkt

5039498 lord what happened why did you allow this to come into my life what are you doing with this drying brook
5039499 im lost for words it is such a relief our experience was everything we stayed sure and we got better
5039500 it is a shame they were werent here but huge thanks to them
5039501 the idea for us is to try and get it cleared up
5039502 its a chance to listen to haroon lorgat about what the situation is so all the players are fully informed knowing that the board are then going to meet on tuesday and make a decision on whether were going or not
5039503 we want to listen to what haroon has to say the key being that if an england team is going there its got to be safe for them to go otherwise were not going to go
5039504 after being chucked into a crazy situation playing a serial killer being recognised with a nomination at such prestigious awards is the icing on the cake
5039505 the nomination is enough but at the end of the day if i took it out of course id be thrilled i am a real fan of the others work so i wont be practising my acceptance speech yet
5039506 it was a great storyline to be a part of it was fun to work with johnny but the crew are the people who should be really recognised at the end of the day
5039507 the shooting crew in the studio and on location were the hardest workers out of all of us
5039508 the fact michael galvin has been recognised finally for all his hard work and fantastic performances over the years is far more important than my nomination in saying that my mum is stoked
5039509 obviously im very delighted but i am wondering what i did this year that i didnt do the other 12
5039510 i love antony starr and erik thompson i think theyre both brilliant actors
5039511 ive known eric since university which is longer ago than either of us would want to admit im honoured to be in their company
5039512 i suspect the undeserved image of the school is what ultimately led to the dramatic drop in the school roll
5039513 no gangs of 13 year old thugs terrorised the science block you couldnt get whiskey with your salad roll at the school canteen
5039514 not one knife fight ever erupted during our sustained silent reading class
5039515 when i was there i think a lot of mastertonians expected makoura to be rough because of the part of town its in
5039516 for those of us who actually were enrolled at the school this idea was laughable
5039517 this is a very emotional subject for current and ex pupils
5039518 for those of us moved by the news of the possible closure its easy to let our affection for makoura overtake the more serious issue of education
5039519 if makoura closes it will be a great loss for the wairarapa
5039520 hes a very important person at the moment im sure it made a lot of people listen

5039524 i could win at home but i would never win in the studio
5039525 ive always been interested in doing things i havent done before and so thats basically what it boils down to ive done live but ive never done this sort of format before so its a genuine challenge
5039526 when opportunity knocks ive always argued youve got to have a pretty reasonable excuse not to do it so why wouldnt you lifes short and i assume i can do it well soon find out
5039527 i would never enter it myself there are lots of things i dont have but one of the things i do have is a relatively good general knowledge im not an expert in any specific area but ive got a reasonable general knowledge so i would be potentially the sort of person who could back themselves to enter the show but i would never do it because i would freak out under pressure id crack
5039528 i could win at home but i would never win in the studio
5039529 i reckon you could have some of the brainiest people in the world go on and lose it versus people who could battle their way through with a pretty reasonable general knowledge and still come out a winner
5039530 my main tip is just to relax from what ive seen its the people who panic early on who lose out they may well know the answer but they freak out
5039531 its actually a very complex show to do or so they keep telling me
5039532 watching it from a hosts point of view is fascinating youre not there to help the contestants youre there to an extent to be their friend
5039533 theyre very different to each other and they bring their own style to the show and ill bring my own style to the new zealand side of it

5039550 yeah its been a little frustrating and to tell you the truth if i had not had a couple of years of experience behind me i dont know how id be handling it
5039551 when youre still in high school you feel like you can win games by yourself
5039552 so this has been as tough a stretch as ive ever experienced but the thing is that i have loads of faith in the ability of these guys in our clubhouse i still believe we are the best team in our division and that all this talent is going to start playing like were supposed to
5039553 theres no question that having gone through last season gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to get the job done
5039554 we cant count on doing it the same away again but we also know from last year what were capable of doing if we keep pushing we know what kind of talent we have
5039555 i remember in the first few days how the doctor asked me if i played any other sports except baseball
5039556 when you hear questions like that you sort of start seeing your dreams start to fade away
5039557 its always a great kick to pitch here in san diego i always look forward to pitching in front of my parents and people ive known all my life and this game will be a big one for me because its a game we really need these are the dog days of the season and we need to start picking each other up

5039560 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5039561 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
5039562 were not selling them we give them free to the people
5039563 we didnt come to cause trouble we just came to bring bibles to help out the chinese christians
5039564 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5039565 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission

5039611 this would basically mean taking one tablet a day rather than requiring eight hours of dialysis every few days
5039612 it has come to our notice that greenpeace india has placed in its website a report under the title biodiversity assessment of dhamra port and surrounding areas orissa the cover page of the report says that the report has been prepared by north orissa university it would like to clarify that no report under the above mentioned title has been prepared by the north orissa university
5039613 a comparison of the greenpeace report as it appears in their website and the report of north orissa university reveals that greenpeace india has doctored the authentic report of the university by way of changing the title and contents for motive best known to them
5039614 it was just an inventory study however to my surprise the greenpeace india has drawn its own conclusion on the impact of the dhamra port on the biodiversity of dhamra estuary
5039615 olive ridley turtles nest on sandy beaches as they need soft sand to dig holes for laying eggs where as the beach north of dhamra river is silted and muddy beach which is unsuitable for habitation and nesting of turtles
5039616 although paradip port is on the way of olive ridley travel path to gahirmatha dhamra port limits is no way related to olive ridley turtles nesting and traverse path
5039617 a total of nine trips were made by the universitys investigators for offshore study during the study period though no sea turtles have been sighted herds of dolphins were sighted off north udabali island
5039618 a total of nine trips were made to the sea no live turtles were sighted possibly because it was past the peak congregation season for the turtles which is november to january
5039619 it is quite obvious that the turtles died in the sea and were washed away to the dhamra side because of the northward wind and the record of such a high number of fresh carcasses during the study period indicates congregation of turtles not far away from dhamra river mouth
5039620 while some of these turtles would have been killed in gahirmatha many carcasses would be of the killed in the off shore waters north of the river mouth and north of kanika sands that is off the port site
5039621 with the area between the high tide line and the low tide line to be covered by dhamra port expansion project being of clay soil and very sticky and could never become a breeding centre for turtles

5039632 im appalled that the government is not moving ahead on its own attack helicopters that would ensure we can move independently as a nation and bring our chinooks into hotspots and difficult landing areas
5039633 to me its fundamental that if were going to have half the capability which is the chinook then we should get the other half of the capability which is an attack helicopter

5039640 a equipe sentiu em v rios momentos a partir do momento que n s atac vamos faltou um pouco de velocidade aquele item diferente que vem sendo marcante no vit ria que a sa da r pida utilizando marquinhos de um lado willans do outro e dinei na frente o jogo acabou sendo ben fico ao nosso advers rio em fun o disso como n o t nhamos aquela velocidade dava tempo para que o time todo do cruzeiro voltasse e se arrumasse de novo
5039641 se analisarmos friamente o vit ria jogou mais teve mais posse de bola chances de fazer gols mas infelizmente n o foi o suficiente para que a equipe levasse os pontos

5039701 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
5039702 bush did not realize that by intervening heavily in other countries affairs he would give the same right to other players
5039703 the u s had no problem to interfere and separate provinces from bigger states like it did with kosovo
5039704 this is exactly what russia is doing now intervening to prevent the annexation of certain provinces to georgia russia is using the same logic that the u s used
5039705 in iraq we were dealing with a fascist government which was hated by all iraqis because of the suffering that was inflicted on them
5039706 saddam husseins regime threatened regional stability and made war with neighboring countries
5039707 why should bush care what russia does to georgia unless he has an interest in the issue to start with

5039974 while we are democrats and republicans in our hearts we are all idahoans
5039975 one of the hardest things weve had to do here is taking off our party hats
