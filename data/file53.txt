530054 i began my photographic documentation of new york citys east and central harlem in 1970 six years after the riot of 1964 that lasted two days and resulted in widespread destruction i was attracted to the neighborhood from the start because harlem seemed to me a tough even militant place where you could see large murals painted on the sides of burnt out buildings encouraging black people to break the chains of oppression to be born again to be free i saw anger and mistrust on the faces of many young people then disconnected from mainstream america harlem was like a run down version of paris where life was lived outside on the streets amid the fading glory of its grand boulevards once imposing and elegant buildings were now derelict the streets looked dirty parks were semi abandoned and dangerous the schools looked decrepit yet a culture different from that of mainstream america was thriving in harlems many nooks and crannies the vibrant street life the scenes of destruction all around me and the constant fear of being mugged made my visits exciting and unpredictable there was something vital going on in harlem in those days and it was not a renaissance a jazz scene a frenzy of sports or a world of gospel singing

530107 consumers appear to be wary of companies who label their products as being green or environmentally friendly
530108 when companies call a product green meaning better for the environment it is usually just a marketing tactic
530109 knowing a company is mindful of their impact on the environment makes me more likely to buy
530110 if you want to change the world change the way the world does business
530111 50 simple things you can do to save the earth

530114 50 simple things you can do to save the earth
530115 somewhat serious but there are other more important issues that we need to address
530116 we see that people tend to really believe product labels and product labeling
530117 so if something says its biodegradable the consumer has a level of trust with that communication
530118 because the advertising or label said the product was environmentally safe or biodegradable
530119 many environmentally safe products are not better for the environment
530120 what will it take for a critical mass of competitively priced widely distributed and high quality green products to be available enough so that buying them feels the rule not the exception what will it take for green to finally be mainstream
530121 what will it take for green to finally go mainstream
530122 in my opinion from a green advocacy perspective i believe environmentalists need to educate people about the consumer benefit of green products

530133 catalytic investments to support technologies products and services that are critical to accelerating plug in vehicle commercialization
530134 it is admittedly an unusual approach but we felt as though we wanted to reach the largest number of people with potentially interesting products services or technologies that could advance plug in vehicles
530135 we felt these technologies services products need to be developed sooner rather than later given the climate challenge that weve got we thought this would be an interesting way to get maximum response

530143 people are going to continue to shop and forty percent of americans carbon footprint comes from everyday consumer products and services
530144 our biggest challenge is helping companies understand that getting to their carbon footprint is not all that hard the people who have been leading the way to their credit have been digging deep into their operations and to where their products and supplies come from and thats really important work but we have to do that more quickly and in so many arenas that there actually isnt the manpower to do it all that way for the next five to ten years
530145 all told cooler is a compelling business ive poked and prodded a bit to find the greenwash potential the thing that critics will zero in on to show that it isnt all its cracked up to be i havent found it though im sure others will they always do

530150 agencies say communicating green values is fast becoming an act of corporate hygiene needed to retain competitiveness and standing with customers
530151 advertisers that make green claims for products and services however face unprecedented public scrutiny particularly from bloggers and other web users
530152 were in the middle of a perfect storm of forces that has caused todays interest in green to catch fire with a much broader audience than in the past
530153 among other things we are a more aware and empowered population this time around thanks to the internet when you see tree huggers on the one hand and the evangelical community on the other unite on a topic such as the environment theres no turning back
530154 features speakers from corporations government agencies ngos and the media discussing how various stakeholders are driving a holistic approach to a green future
530155 i would like to believe that most big advertising agencies are ahead of the curve on marketplace trends and on what will impact their clients brands and best interests
530156 i would like to believe they eagerly seek to become educated before these topics become mainstream so their clients are prepared to maximize opportunities in the marketplace but that just hasnt been my experience it is their clients the brands who lead the way when it comes to green once again brands are driving madison avenue to catch up and get informed

530171 in my opinion the statistics and the committees comments over the years since the court of appeal made that observation do give rise to powerful misgivings about the lawfulness of many abortions they tend to confirm dr forsters view that new zealand essentially has abortion on request
530172 there is reason to doubt the lawfulness of many abortions authorised by certifying consultants
530173 the approval rate for abortions seems remarkably high bearing in mind that under section 187a the consultants must form the good faith opinion that continuance of the pregnancy would result in serious danger to the mothers health
530174 right to life is confident that the court of appeal will uphold the judgment in respect to these important issues it is the intention of right to life to cross appeal and re present our case denied in the high court for the legal recognition of the status of the unborn child as a human being and a person endowed by its creator with human rights the foundation right being the right to life secondly there will be the opportunity to put before the court of appeal the issue which the royal commission considered important whether abortion counsellors should be independent from abortion providers

530183 where can a person be better than in the bosom of their family

530186 it will bring failure an iraq that falls into chaos or civil war will mean massive human suffering well beyond what has already occurred within iraqs borders the gains made against al qaida and other extremist groups could easily evaporate and they could establish strongholds to be used as safe havens for regional and international operations
530187 iraq is determined to undermine u s and coalition forces efforts by providing arms and training to insurgents to attack forces and civilians its aim is to weaken american resolve and force a premature withdrawal

530243 it explains our frailties our addictions our infidelities and other moral deficiencies as byproducts of adaptation over billions of years and that dowd says has a potentially liberating effect never mind guilt once we understand our sinful ways we can get past them and play a conscious role in the evolution of humanity

530291 he never made a fuss about his birthday hed just get on with it as if it were a normal day
530292 he wouldnt buy cake except maybe for his kids he did receive birthday calls on his cellphone and would be thankful but dont push it by suggesting that you go for lunch the answer would be an emphatic no
530293 wherever they go people want to know who they are theyve proved to be professional and versatile they play a little bit of rock and reggae and eddie is very excited to have worked with them
530294 working with eddie speaks volumes for the band and their professionalism discipline and being committed to what you do
530295 had it not been for their commitment they would not have received the eddie grant deal
530296 god knows they needed that there is no work here at home they lived on the road overseas with lucky and to have that continuity even after his death is remarkable its a blessing
530297 eddie is still a megastar and when you look at him on stage you can see that hes crossed over its a big gain for us his style of music is not only reggae he branches to rock and pop
530298 he may have been neglected here at home when he was still alive but he was popular at some point in his life and early career
530299 i believe that luckys legacy will be as ambassador to the world most of you dont know the level at which lucky was respected outside our borders he got so many red carpet treatments but you know whats funny he was normal he always wanted to know why he received special treatment he disliked segregation and classifying and sidelining people this is what he preached against and he lived it
530300 dube was not mainstream radio he was not big on radio and in the media so im not sure if he benefited the local reggae scene as he was not that much of an activist in developing reggae he will be sorely missed and i believe that you cannot die in vain well always learn something there must be a bigger motive what really happened the night dube was killed
530301 reggae can never die as a genre of music thats impossible bob marley made sure of that well be singing one love until we die
530302 but the level of shock around what happened hasnt diminished his passing stopped the whole nation he has an enormous presence culturally and i think although south african audiences had overlooked him in a way in recent times his stature is undeniable not a day goes by without me hearing his music it was a great privilege to work with someone like him
530303 what i think has happened is the evolution whereby youngsters are adding new elements to the music there is still a market out there for the type of reggae lucky dube was doing
530304 the biggest problem is that we dont have platforms in terms of radio programming very few stations play reggae and that on its own eats away at the retail confidence
530305 even prior to his death all his previous releases like slave and prisoner have always been on the best seller list
530306 after his death there was that spike there is a loyal fan base listening to the music is about addressing social issues whether youre not a reggae fan or not
530307 his songs are timeless they were even relevant during the anti xenophobia campaign for example the song together as one

530320 the water crisis is the result of a series of governmental failures over the years the governments chose to give precedence to immediate financial considerations over allocating the necessary funds to create desalination facilities rehabilitating the water aquifers implementing an effective water economizing plan and reclaimed drainage water

530329 back in 04 the olympic teams performance in athens left a great deal to be desired
530330 i had no idea at that moment that i would be asked if i would consider taking over the program but i did have a prerequisite full autonomy
530331 i was aware of how things were structured in the past and i felt we needed to change the culture
530332 with this program weve asked them to be committed to playing for their country and not just to play
530333 these guys have done that over the last two years weve seen this program develop to where whether it be lebron james kobe bryant or jason kidd they feel like theyre part of a team part of a movement and theyre very proud to represent the united states
530334 i think in some respects over the years weve been pretty arrogant saying its our game its not our game its the worlds game and the respect weve shown to international basketball over the last two years will pay dividends
530335 when were with our teams we complain i wish i had chris paul in the backcourt or i wish i had dwight howard
530336 i want this guy i want that guy because we all want to win
530337 well everyone is in the room everyone is here theres no excuses now we have to get the job done
530338 obviously the most talented team without a question in the world
530339 ive learned a lot about these individuals getting to talk with them and look them in the eye
530340 as far as garnett is concerned we never got any positive feedback
530341 it was more about ive been there ive done that its time for someone else to do it
530342 i think we have a unique opportunity right now in representing our country and not just by going for the gold medal in beijing
530343 we can set a standard for how the game should be played right now in our own country with teamwork with camaraderie with enthusiasm with an attention to detail that makes basketball such a great team game
530344 this team is showing all of that hopefully well show it at an even higher level and that will serve as an example for the kids growing up where basketball wont be all about a sound bite or a highlight dunk

530378 i appeal again to the iranian side no longer to play for time but to give us a usable answer to our offers stop dallying
530379 we have not had any discussion or agreement of the so called timeline of two weeks
530380 they have discovered water on mars for the third or fourth time
530381 it wont be the last time we lose and we will win another game as well the response is going to be important
530382 the all blacks built pressure and didnt allow us to build any pressure the all blacks were very good on the tackle line and as a consequence we werent able to get into the game
530383 they profited from some of that pressure they built and it was one of those days when you get a sense nothing is going to work
530384 it is not one we look back on and reflect on with a lot of pride
530385 it reflected the way the game went the all blacks grew an arm and a leg and were prepared to have a crack
530386 i thought they the wallabies played bloody well last week and we played well this week thats about it
530387 the next contest is going to be massive both teams will have equal edge we had the edge today every dog has his day and it happened to be our day today
530388 they the wallabies never got any front foot ball some of the tackles put in really knocked them off their feet get the best of foxtel
530389 the new prime minister yousuf raza gilani who was in washington this week to meet president bush says he is doing his best to convince his country that this is pakistans war but he seems not to have won the argument within his own government
530390 this complex situation calls for a careful and flexible response from the united states and to its credit the outgoing bush administration is making a relatively good start at fashioning that response
530391 the question of power has been settled by the elections
530392 it should be stressed that executive power will remain with the elected president
530393 that drill is moving in the direction that we want it to move of course that drill is geared toward the linebackers but i thought the backs did a nice job of stepping up and competing
530394 we challenged him to be at his best hes a second year guy along with everybody else in his class and i really think he has embraced that challenge hes a talented guy as you guys can see but hes not a finished product by any means but he does have an attitude to come out here and get better every time we work
530395 we have some young guys who have to step up and understand the speed of the professional game and what we require them to do we have the makings of a good solid unit there with some depth but the young guys have to come on
530396 i just stressed the point to the team that we have to be ready to go under all circumstances we have to be at our best we have very few 1 p m kickoffs with this football team this year well get another opportunity at a night practice here in a few days and it has to be better for us from an execution standpoint from an attention to detail standpoint i liked the energy i love the way the guys compete but not our best performance from a technique standpoint here at camp of course every time we come out we want to be better in that area i didnt think we did that tonight and sometimes that happens we have to evaluate it make corrections and move forward i think well do that

530404 the case against barack obama the unlikely rise and unexamine
530405 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
530406 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
530407 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
530408 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
530409 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
530410 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
530411 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
530412 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
530413 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
530414 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
530415 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past

530417 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
530418 it has not done anything to address the energy problem and its actually spent heavily on you know financing climate skeptics on basically blocking intelligent policy on muddying the waters of our debate
530419 if jimmy carter had actually managed to sell us on energy conservation 30 years ago we would be in a lot better shape than we are right now
530420 with the price of a gallon of gas up 2 50 since george bush was sworn in why would anybody trust a republican to do the right thing on prices at the pump drilling or the profit that exxonmobil just declared for the second quarter 11 680 000 000
530421 eight years ago the average price of a gallon of gas was 1 47 and now its 3 95 eight years ago exxonmobils second quarter earnings were 4 015 000 000 today that company announced second quarter earnings that are the highest in u s corporate history a record breaking 11 680 000 000 amazing what happens when two former oilmen are in charge of the country how in the heck did we not see that coming
530422 now whether you know bush is responsible for high oil prices i dont think you can make that case but we should remember that he promised he said back in 2000 that he had he knew what to do he would be able to talk opec into opening the spigots and you know they havent managed to do that so this is a failed energy policy for sure
530423 pretty good in saying the oil drilling plan is nonsense
530424 oh no they dont do i mean if you want to you know the reason to hate exxon is not that it makes so much money per se its the fact that it has not done anything to address the energy problem and its actually spent heavily on you know financing climate skeptics on basically blocking intelligent policy on muddying the waters of our debate now whether we could have you know to be fair we dont have lots of sugarcane so we couldnt really have done it as easily as the brazilians did but we could you know if jimmy carter had actually managed to sell us on energy conservation 30 years ago we would be in a lot better shape than we are right now
530425 i think hes falling into the kind of mistake that i would tend to make which is saying you know this is silly this is ridiculous nobody is going to believe that and thats not good enough and i think hes got to look when i read obamas response to the mccain ad about you know prices at the pump obamas response was you know this is the same old politics which is true but you know he was being dismissive obama was being dismissive when he ought to be outraged hes got to do something this is an outrage this guy is insulting your intelligence hes really doing bad stuff and you shouldnt be taken in by this not just sort of oh well you know i think this was obama being a little bit too much of a professor if i can say that
530426 you know this is silly this is ridiculous nobody is going to believe that
530427 this is an outrage this guy is insulting your intelligence hes really doing bad stuff and you shouldnt be taken in by this
530428 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

530473 but if you release the modified version to the public in some way the gpl requires you to make the modified source code available to the programs users under the gpl
530474 there will be no formal team nor will there be any getting voted off the team think of projects like mono wine or linux as models
530475 given that you think that mono wine and linux are terrible examples of open source projects
530476 someday ill go to the zoolander school for kids who cant code good and then maybe i too will write high quality code
530477 projects like linux demonstrate how to scale an open source project there is no formal team and there is no getting voted off the team
530478 thanks again for all your help figuring out opengl problems you are extremely skilled at graphics programming
530479 talented devs should have no problem following them and very talented devs will actually want to follow them

530482 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of barack obamas magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider
530483 obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome

530490 its a tragic tragic thing and its so easy to avoid just by listening to other peoples experiences and acting upon it
530491 it said that the xbmc helper thing was running hence i couldn install

530494 hell if i was working on something gpld there is no way id release the source in the condition it is in when its beta id need to clean it up and document it before letting the public see it that doesnt mean im not complying it means i have pride in what i release to the world for review

530499 i dont think theres anything that would preclude us from working together how we cooperate thats the question
530500 are a rattly ship where theres no control over where these platforms are going
530501 the problem right now is there are too many open source players
530502 it doesnt make sense in a marketplace to have multiple vendors doing the same thing if you combine all that effort into one you should have a lot more effect
530503 more feasible for android to merge with limo than with symbian because the technology underpinnings are the same
530504 there are clear competitive reasons why nokia which owns all the intellectual property and will be the biggest contributor to the open source symbian foundation has no commercial incentive at all to work with google
530505 this is really nothing new weve seen linux consortiums come and go
530506 in the future being a developer on someones platform will mean being hosted on their infrastructure
530507 a key test of whether an api is open is whether it is used to enable services that are not hosted by the api provider

530509 xbmc had been going nowhere for years until elan dedicated a lot of his personal time and
530510 but it sucks and is rather unfair when someone takes your work improves it in a great way but doesnt leave you with a means to take advantage and improve it even further

530518 i wish you had to solder a mod chip in to get it to work
530519 as ive written above the centerstage ui will become an enhanced plex skin theres no intent to throw out working code based on your comment i think youll see this as a good thing
530520 the centerstage ui will become an enhanced plex skin the reason for this is that davids ui has some whizz bang features that are simply impossible to make with skin features as they stand right now
530521 individually we were never totally crap the mac community was crap sorry to be so blunt but it is the truth there wasnt even enough support out there to able to make and produce a mediocre alpha with a place holder ui do you think we even like releasing that if the community developer effort was better and the code was better we wouldnt be releasing crappy alphas the alpha is a product of the community because it shows how much effort the community as a whole put into this if you want better then help us out if not then dont complain we will get there eventually we can only go at this pace until we get more help or eventually reach the code level to produce the final interface see the ui demo we do actually want to release at every step we tried to be positive and get people interested in helping us make a mac based media center nobody stepped up yet the community complains that four guys only 1 developer btw couldnt do it from scratch then to drum up some excitement and get developer support we showed the community the interface we wanted showed them the direction the final vision of the project and although the response to that interface concept was amazing yet again nobody stepped up to help make it happen so why has centerstage never moved along at an acceptable pace why do we get emails forum posts asking about progress why do the bitter forum members at avs still complain who knows because we as a group here never put a foot wrong in trying to make this happen im sure picky people can point a finger back at us somehow such is life what could we have done differently the blame is not all on us i feel we fight everyday what are you doing ultimately the community needs to take a look at themselves so what do we do what do we do to make a mac media center happen
530522 were still going to be shipping with pm3 until the centerstage skin is far enough advanced

530527 theres not a tiger within a thousand miles of here
530528 thats a likely path a lot of it is timing and opportunity well just see
530529 were going to be doing that as we move along its way too early to talk about 2011
530530 im going to be very happy in 2011 if i choose to run again to run against any of them

530543 for someone who sat in the stands all those years this truly is the ultimate sports fans dream i am extremely honored that andre has given me this unique opportunity
530544 its football season im trying to put everything behind me and concentrate on the season its a good thing i was supported by a great organization my teammates were all behind me my family my wife but its time to focus on the season now and put everything behind me
530545 but what it tells you is that we are seeing near panic in the mortgage fund and mortgage trust sector
530546 the culture doesnt work the model doesnt work the liquidity doesnt work the risk return is not right and in my view if the result of all these freezings of mortgage trusts is that in the future the public does not use them again that would be a good thing

530553 are they stupid enough not to see that i am a chemist not a biologist
530554 i think the discussions are moving ahead and i hope we have something resolved by monday i think weve gotten to the point where we kind of have to force it
530555 i was interjected into it because there was a tampering charge initially
530556 im not looking for things to interject myself to its an issue that needs to be addressed because of the competing interests you want to make sure its done properly and within our rules this is an issue that ultimately has to be decided between brett and the packers
530557 whats going on between brett and the organization is something that the players and coaches we cannot handle
530558 were not involved in it i think they did a good job from a responsibility standpoint dealing with it for about two days but the focus has been on improving

530575 john mccains overtures to black groups like the naacp and now the urban league may make for well needed press but at the same time why do republicans continue to blow off the one group of black folk they know will vote for them black republicans
530576 this coming wednesday in manhattan the black republican forum will meet and john mccain has been invited however to date no acknowledgment of his interest in attending has been received this is quite disappointing and to be truthful is a slap in the face to all those who are in the trenches taking the kind of slings and arrows on a daily basis john mccain could never comprehend this is not meant to be a woe is us lament but being a black republican is not something many sane people would opt to do in todays america while people are walking on eggshells countering barack obama because any inference of racism could doom the deliverer the left can have and will continue to discharge their racist venom on black conservatives with no adverse consequences all are still working black republicans for the most part agree with john mccain so hes assured of a warm reception any time he chooses to meet with us and its not just mccain im talking about here president bush has met with black republicans how many times i dont remember any press accounts off the top of my head
530577 the gop doesnt have to pander to us they just need include us they just need empower us but unfortunately theyve seemingly written us off as that five percent they assume theyll get disregarding the fact that if they made us part of the team we could up that percentage to a potentially winning margin and whats more insulting given the private internal opinions issued within the black gop are the token attempts at outreach who is behind the gop strategy to reach black people is it a token overture or is it a real strategy to turn that five percent into thirty the dirty little secret is if democrats lost that stranglehold on the black vote theyd be screwed in presidential elections for years so keeping blacks victims and rewarding them with entitlements is their imperative black conservatives can counter this if given a real infrastructure and the autonomy to do so but it would appear that the republican leadership would much rather spend all of their time trying to convince liberal blacks theyre not racists instead of allowing us on their behalf to prove it believe it or not were already armed with the facts and just need the honest backing of the party it would show black conservatives that our efforts are appreciated and will be supported if john mccain went to black republican conventions that would most definately give him better press than that which he is getting now where the media gleefully reports of the frosty receptions he receives from black democrats has barack obama reached out to us hell no none of his three to four hundred advisors have to this day have ever even considered coming to meet with black conservatives why do republicans constantly pander to hostile black groups while traditionally ignoring those who will vote for them on election day
530578 i know many people are going to be mad i wrote this but i needed to vent and dont make massah mad is something i havent had to worry about since leaving the democrat party 13 years ago real black republicans wont vote for barack obama then again many could also find something else to do on november 4th if this election is as close as the previous ones have been john mccain cant afford to lose one vote republicans should be reaching out to us it shouldnt have to continue to be the other way around give us some power set us loose and see what damage we could do to the democrat voting block kissing their asses gets you nothing blowing off black republicans perpetuates the ill will within senator mccain its all up to you

530646 i had smoked pot and drank alcohol a little bit but not a whole lot
530647 its something ive regretted every day since the most life changing event that has ever happened to me would have to be becoming addicted to meth which at the time i didnt even know it was addictive i wasnt even aware of it i was just having some fun and smoked it then for the next year and a half it was a downhill roller coaster i couldnt stop at the same time i thought i had it under control i slowly sold off anything i owned as my habit per day increased when i ran out of things to sell i was so far gone that i started stealing i would steal from people who knew me from friends songwriters i would take a guitar when they werent looking
530648 he said i was the worst thief hed ever seen in his life hed never seen anyone break in and then return something theyd taken
530649 i wanted to feel better about me i had been chasing the dream of a recording deal for about 10 years and it just wasnt happening failed marriages divorce i just got really got the point where i didnt like me i didnt like my life i wanted some relief from that drugs made me feel better temporarily you got to understand the first time i did it i thought i was superman the rest of the time i was trying to get back to the way i felt the first time
530650 what i didnt realize was the damage you can do to yourself physically and mentally when you start doing it your body immediately starts to deteriorate because you deprive it of all the minerals and good things you need you dont sleep and you dont really eat either its almost like slowly going insane your thinking changes behaviour changes for me whatever darkness there was i had within me anyway that really brought it out the more i did it the more i withdrew from society i kept to myself it was like a snowball the more miserable you become the more you want to feel better and keep going back to the drugs again and again
530651 i am honest about it im not here to beat anybody over the head with religion i share my experience for two reasons to keep somebody from going down the same road i went down or if youre on the same road to let you know theres a way off of it out there and there are so many people who will help you if youre sincere and are ready to get off of it its really become one of the worst drug epidemics its reached epidemic proportions in our country
530652 ive been to church on a sunday and ive been to jail i put my whole family through living hell and ive been a heavy cross to bear on the wings of mamas prayers
530653 on march 14 2001 i was arrested for grand theft and drug possession and looking at a sentence of 15 years
530654 i went through withdrawal in my jail cell and when i woke up seven days later i had my first clear thought in years after about seven days of withdrawal and that type of thing shakes fever night sweats and all that stuff nightmares i had realized where i was and i was the reason i was there and i deserved to be there i had lied i cheated everybody i had cared about and everybody that had cared about me i didnt want to be that person any more
530655 i asked god for help i got on the phone and started calling everybody i had taken things from i wanted everybody to know where their stuff was and that i was the one who took it and that i was sorry
530656 the coolest thing about that was everyone forgave me every single person forgave me not only forgave me but in a lot of cases actually tried to help me
530657 that was the biggest surprise ever because i couldnt find it for a long time in my heart to forgive myself i felt like okay god forgives me everybody forgives me and i was having such a hard time with hating myself for what i had done
530658 i dont have the right to judge me either i dont think he gives us that right that turned everything around and i was able to let it go i was able to forgive myself and not condemn myself
530659 i dont think any of us are that strong i had help with people from counsellors from people who were qualified to do that who were qualified to help drug addicts i had spiritual help i had help from my community my family
530660 i called her and told her she said well i love you and ill be praying for you and ill see you when you get out there was no bail there was no money that was the biggest help of all making me face the consequences of what i had done and leaving me somewhere i couldnt get to the drug for awhile
530661 i lock up my old took box and hide all my fishing gear cause my in laws are all outlaws but they aint wanted here
530662 i told them the truth about too many marriages drug addiction jail
530663 i remember joe galante stood up and told me hed call me in a few weeks and let me know what they had decided about 15 minutes after i walked through the door the phone rung nobody was more surprised than me
530664 the first time around nobody knew who i was im talking about songwriters in nashville some of the best songwriters in the face of the earth are here if they dont know what you do or what youre about then they cant pitch you songs that fit you the second time around we wanted just the best songs no matter who wrote them we solicited songs from all over town and spent time looking for them we had a few that i had written i think that it gave us a better cd than the first time around more well rounded
530665 it was one of my favourite songs when i was a kid campy cheesy fun go to the beach type song
530666 what was funny about it we had actually been doing it in our show live because i have a predominantly female audience its a lot of fun then of course when i went in the studio with kenny beard we were working with blake chancey and he calls me one day and he says brother i had a dream last night i had a dream you were singing in front of a bunch of women and you were singing that old crash craddock song i said you got to be kidding me i do it live in the show at the time he had never seen my show
530667 its kind of a weird karma thing going on there
530668 i sing about relationships because the truth of the matter is if it was humanly possible to do so i would go back and change things i did things i said
530669 i dont blame anybody for the failure of my marriages but me in the course of that ive learned what not to do i dont know what women want to hear but i know really well what they dont want to hear i know what it takes to make a marriage work a relationship work its so simple it takes openness and honesty i sing about it now because i want to connect with guys out there that are kind of like me and hopefully saying what they feel and arent good at saying
530670 i try to connect at the end of the day at the end of my life whats going to matter to me are relationships and connections ive made to people its not going to be whether i had a hit record or not its not going to be whether i drove a nice car or a bicycle its not about stuff its about people thats the level that i try to connect with people on with their heart with their soul with their emotions i just treat them like i want to be treated that means for me staying after every show and signing autographs
530671 my real mama was apache my real daddy hell dont ask me mama says she dont remember him and im sure somewhere in my history ive got some slave blood in me and some folks think im mexican i never really fit in any place cause theres always a part of me to hate
530672 i was born in alabama but i never knew my mama she gave me away at three months old
530673 i know you may doubt it but if you stop and think about it theres one common thing that weve all got people from all countries come here because theyre hungry for whats cookin in americas melting pot were all different but the same reds the only colour in our vein
530674 there was one little country store five or six miles from our house
530675 we spent a lot of hours together waiting on the porch for daddy to come in from work we were singing those songs together
530676 we lived in the woods we lived a long way from a radio station no tv to speak of we spent a lot of time listening or playing records she was a huge music fan which helped me a lot i loved music it was in my blood
530677 my daddy was working the logging business and his health was beginning to fail he had a lot of trouble with his lungs right around every christmas as far as i could remember he got sick he got pneumonia it got worse and worse on him
530678 i got into a fight on a bus and i got suspended when i got home i thought my daddy was going to give me a country butt whipping
530679 i need you to work and there was no point in going back but i did real good in school i got great grades
530680 i traded a 57 chevy for my first guitar and daddy said i was crazy cause that was a helluva car when i played love me tender on that fender and music came pourin out of my hands and heart he knew it was worth it and so did i cause sometimes some things dont have a price
530681 the club owner came up to me and said how would you like to work here six nights a week
530682 i went in the next morning and quit my oil rig job
530683 i came in from work two weeks after i got married
530684 it was a huge shock because where i come from you didnt leave
530685 eventually we played at least 30 of the 50 states even canada we decided we needed an album so i started writing because i needed songs for it i wrote 10 and recorded them in little rock in 1995 the album was called country is my middle name by jeff bates amp southern storm i felt i was ready for nashville so we moved here in 1997 for the first time in my life i felt like i was at home i really did nashville challenged and inspired me
530686 i moved back to little rock and it was all downhill from there
530687 it was my fault i made up my mind that i wanted to be in music and i wanted to get a record deal she was kind of scared to leave the town where we lived seminary mississippi she didnt want to leave i had someone tell me if i wanted to be mickey mouse i had to go to disneyland i had to get as close to nashville as possible
530688 they asked about me for the first time in my life i was 100 me i sang my songs and told the truth about drugs stealing and going to jail everything i stood up thanked them for their time and shook their hands fifteen minutes after i walked in the front door back home the phone rings and they tell me that rca wants to give me a deal
530689 what i want to bring to country music is realism
530690 im trying to get as real as it is as real as you want to get

530805 podemos hacer historia en lautaro existen all cerca de 300 comunidades y los avances que hemos logrado como partido nos tienen optimistas sabemos que tenemos que trabajar duro y el mandato que la gente a entregado a luis es competir para ganar

530817 el avance de un proceso en condiciones tales que afectar a fatalmente las garant as constitucionales vinculadas con las formas del enjuiciamiento criminal por lo que a mi criterio resultar a tard o atender esos agravios en ocasi n del fallo final de la causa ya que aunque la sentencia fuese absolutoria el perjuicio que el apelante hubiera querido evitar ya se habr a soportado
530818 no concierta con el r gimen imperante el hecho de que un tema en el que se encuentre planteada una cuesti n federal no merezca por limitaciones de fuente local el conocimiento del rgano m ximo de una provincia y s que sea propio de la corte suprema de la naci n

530851 i think the discussions are moving ahead and i hope we have something resolved by monday i think weve gotten to the point where we kind of have to force it
530852 primarily it starts with whether brett favre wants to play football and then second whether the packers want him to play for them
530853 i was interjected into it because there was a tampering charge initially
530854 im not looking for things to interject myself to its an issue that needs to be addressed because of the competing interests you want to make sure its done properly and within our rules this is an issue that ultimately has to be decided between brett and the packers
530855 whats going on between brett and the organization is something that the players and coaches we cannot handle
530856 were not involved in it i think they did a good job from a responsibility standpoint dealing with it for about two days but the focus has been on improving

530917 it seems unthinkable but for the first time in history ice is on course to disappear entirely from the north pole this year
530918 this suggests that the flu vaccine doesnt protect seniors as much as has been thought
530919 ours is by far the largest case control study of flu vaccine in the elderly
530920 we tried to overcome the limits of previous studies done by others
530921 those studies may have overestimated the benefits of the flu vaccine in the elderly for various reasons
530922 they are less likely than younger healthier seniors to go out and get vaccinated and more apt to develop pneumonia
530923 thats why our study used a control time period after flu vaccine became available but before each flu season actually started
530924 because those who got the vaccine happened to be healthier not because the flu vaccine was protecting them from pneumonia caused by the flu since it wasnt present yet
530925 despite our findings and even though immune responses are known to decline with age i still want my grandmother to keep getting the flu vaccine
530926 the flu vaccine is safe so it seems worth getting even if it might lower the risk of pneumonia and death only slightly
530927 people age 65 and older should still get yearly flu vaccines as usual

530959 i was running a little harder and faster than i should have been running and pulled my right hamstring
530960 i went down and i couldnt hardly walk i managed to make it down the aisle ok and nobody knew i dont think but three days later it started turning blue it was nasty
530961 i was pretty bad for about three weeks i couldnt have played now its been five weeks and its better but not 100 percent im a little bit discouraged about that
530962 but at 54 i guess my healing powers arent what they once were
530963 im ready for it to be like it was before i did it but that might take a little longer
530964 there wasnt as much wind early and there were a bunch of good scores when we got out here we saw there were a ton of good scores and so i kind of figured i could shoot one of those good scores too but the wind kicked up from when we were on the 7th hole and it really never let up from then on in and made the course play a little bit harder
530965 i havent been playing competitively so its kind of hard to be sharp on those
530966 ive done some good things and played well enough to be 2 over par with a couple of 70 rounds on a tough golf course its not awful but when theres half a dozen guys under par and one guy 9 under one guy 7 under id like to be a little closer to them than i am
530967 oakland hills is one of my favorite places ive been there a lot played there a lot had the ryder cup there got smoked there in 2004
530968 i love the golf course and im anxious to see what theyve done to it i think theyve added some length which certainly doesnt help me and taken out some trees everything is probably going to be beautiful and really a hard test so im anxious to see it hopefully ill feel better
530969 but you know there are a lot of young guys that would love to play and if im not 100 percent then its silly for me to go up there
530970 you are just going to have to really be on in every phase of your game especially putting the greens are really treacherous at oakland hills and you have to know where to miss it
530971 they are a little like these greens here at the broadmoor you have to try to stay underneath the hole fortunately these arent as fast as they will be up there you can get putts up there that you will look very very foolish on
530972 thats why im thinking the jeld wen for the champions tour obviously is more important than the pga championship thats hard to believe that i would say that but it is in my schedule so if im going to be in shape for either one id rather be in shape for the jeld wen
530973 its a long way out there and i need to be feeling better for that tournament and the rest of the champions tour schedule

530975 very important that the fbi present their case against bruce and not just state that the investigation was over because it was him and hes gone
530976 im concerned about what closing this case without conclusive evidence might do to harm our life sciences enterprise i think we as americans need to see the proof
530977 its a shame the man is not here with us we might have known more
530978 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure

530999 based on our experience the overwhelming reason for the ccp to block a website is not because it may have harmful content such as pornography or excessive violence
531000 the main reason they block a website is because they are trying to cover up human rights abuses and other crimes carried out by the state so the real question here i think is why are they so afraid of journalists having free access to information about falun gong

531005 using stroke doc our stroke team physicians were able to evaluate the patient and help make the correct decision about treatment over 98 percent of the time compared to only 82 percent of the time when doing a telephone consultation to a remote site
531006 when a person suffers a stroke time is of the essence
531007 if you make a poor decision using a telephone consultation you potentially put the patient at risk for a poor outcome
531008 the question we set out to ask with this five year study was did we make the right decision the answer was overwhelmingly yes
531009 rural physicians can now provide much needed specialty care to their patients via telemedicine
531010 this is welcome news for rural healthcare providers in the u s

531254 we are putting america at more risk not less risk
531255 i think its an important risk but frankly im more concerned about bombs and guns which are easily available and can be very destructive
531256 the federal bureau of investigation and the intelligence community were the ones who were most concerned about it
531257 if a man came at us with a gun and said he had to kill one of us i would tell him to kill me
531258 im sorry t i wont bother you anymore i want to be your friend
531259 i will turn this train around oh yes i will
531260 ive got strollers coming out of my ears like 24 of them does anyone want one
531261 it was fun but its not good to see guys wrecking under yellow
531262 hes doing good i mean hes valuable because he can play everywhere
531263 hes a great defensive player and he can get some hits and roll the balls up the middle hes a spark plug he comes to play every day and when hes healthy hes a good player
531264 oh yeah and id match nickys glove with anybody i mean range everything hes all over the field and casilla has done a hell of a job over there but nicky youll match him anywhere defensively in the infield
531265 hes just shortened his swing up and hes got his hands in a better position than he had them last year
531266 hes able to get down on the ball a little bit better and stay and cover the ball
531267 lirianos done what he needed to do to get back up here
531268 hes our future hes our present and our future we needed to get him in the rotation and it was time to do that were going to see what this young man has if he comes back like were hoping he is and the way hes been throwing he can be a huge boost its like getting a big trade right here
531269 i never say rebuilding because youre in the major leagues you rebuild in the minor leagues
531270 but i knew we were going to have to do a lot of teaching of young players and hopefully we could get better as we went along you know what thats what weve done
531271 theyve all come in here with open minds and theyve all gotten after the game thats all we try to do around here get after the game we try to teach and we try to play
531272 theyre getting after it and theyre playing and they have no fear
531273 thats all we care about around here no fear go out and play the game
531274 hes been the hottest hitter in the minor leagues for us hes hitting 300 against lefties
531275 we needed some help against some lefties here monroe struggled against lefties and we need some help against lefties and this young man has been swinging
531276 it seems like any time we need a big hit and somebody to drive in some runs hes stepping up and clearing bases for us its awesome when you see that but we all expect that everyday
531277 the main issue right now is with the ncaa clearinghouse and my sat scores they canceled my last scores
531278 we should be much better i think last year we went through a growth period trying to figure out what we had here we had a bunch of new players but as much as that i think randy foye being hurt for the first half of the season really put us back i think after randy came back we were 17 21 or something like that coming down the stretch for a lot of these guys familiarity is going to make us much much better
531279 i think fans are supporting us right now theyre showing that they want to see this new team this young team
531280 ive seen him play a couple times and ive seen his recruiting process
531281 you guys got a great player there a big guy that can really run the floor and can really score in transition so the gophers should be excited about that one i had a brother that played at northern state in aberdeen s d ryan miller who was a really good basketball player
531282 hes doing good i mean hes valuable because he can play everywhere
531283 hes a great defensive player and he can get some hits and roll the balls up the middle hes a spark plug he comes to play every day and when hes healthy hes a good player

531299 i think fans are supporting us right now theyre showing that they want to see this new team this young team
531300 ive seen him play a couple times and ive seen his recruiting process
531301 you guys got a great player there a big guy that can really run the floor and can really score in transition so the gophers should be excited about that one i had a brother that played at northern state in aberdeen s d ryan miller who was a really good basketball player
531302 how do you think i feel about you coming to my store and buying something using it and returning it
531303 i dont understand i asked one of your workers and they said the return policy was 14 days
531304 i dont understand this happens all the time people buy things try them out and return them theyre not going to be returned in new condition
531305 a person who acts in contradiction to his or her stated beliefs or feelings
531306 we couldnt have done what we did had that great run without them thats for sure
531307 one of the things youve got to be able to do as a coach is handle different relationships and know how to motivate them its a really outstanding testament to emmitt
531308 i know all of us feel blessed to go in but to go in with those two young men that i had a chance to work with probably had some play in continuing my coaching career is the topping on all of it
531309 from what im understanding i think im officially the second fastest guy in the family and theres only two of us in here
531310 i felt we probably hurt art some because we played him inside and he even blocked for us in there
531311 it probably cost him some yards on average per catch
531312 you know he coached art first before he transferred over to defense and coached me now you talk about something interesting
531313 what he brought to me was an appreciation and a knowledge of what i was doing and not to begin to try and adjust that but saying youre doing it youre doing what you need to do because i know what it takes at that position
531314 emmitt came up in a time when you played both ways in college
531315 i think it goes back to what he had to do in his era which was pretty much whatever it takes thats the way he learned the game and i learned a lot from him
531316 there are times in my career where i just lost confidence
531317 i can even remember one point we were going into a meeting he gibbs pulled me aside and said hey i know youre going through some hard times right now but i still believe in you im going to play you im still going to count on you
531318 i think we all wanted to play and do the things that he taylor did
531319 it really doesnt matter now because we are all in the same place

531338 this death which appears so dreadful is very little for the purchase of eternal life
531339 a man can kill and still be the sweetest thing
531340 we did not rush the material onto air but instead consulted with local authorities who have since publicly acknowledged our appropriate handling of the matter
531341 we believe it provides some answers to the critical question why did this man carry out these awful murders
531342 however unpleasant it might have been for us all to watch we are journalists and it was inarguably a huge news development
531343 there is this stereotype of a person in debt being someone who doesnt earn enough money to buy things and goes overdrawn or takes out a loan or maxes out their credit card regardless of the consequences
531344 we dont associate it with people earning more than 30 000 a year who look polished drive lovely cars live in a well presented home with high end appliances and holiday twice a year
531345 the past few months have seen many people calling our moneyfreedom advice service all in the same boat they got a taste for a comfortable life and found themselves offered credit freely and the temptation proved irresistible and they made life even more enjoyable with easy to meet repayments
531346 this year the cost of living has gone up interest rates have increased energy prices have soared and fuel prices have rocketed suddenly driving around in a bmw isnt as affordable as it was and the leather sofa in front of the vast flat screen tv isnt as comfortable as it used to be because people are a little anxious that they havent actually paid for it yet
531347 in the past six months 12 people have been made redundant at my company because they are not bringing sales in and nobody has any money to spend so nobody is meeting their targets
531348 in 2007 i made more than 15 000 in commission this year ive made less than 5 000 people will be horrified to think that someone could earn more than 50 000 in one year and not save any of it
531349 my property cost me almost 200 000 i had to take out a 100 per cent mortgage to buy it and if the reports are correct if i sold it id never get enough to repay the loan off
531350 i suppose i never really worried because i was so easily making the payments but that commission was a vital part of my lifestyle i was paying a huge amount on my mortgage and all of my bills and then at the beginning of the year just as i noticed the difference in my monthly salary those costs rocketed as everything else slumped
531351 so i started paying the bills on my credit card i dont need to go on really it goes without saying that i operated the same system to maintain my social life and to buy clothes and then when two of my close colleagues found themselves out of a job in may it pulled me up short and i realised that if it happens to me ive had it my home basically belongs to a building society and my car belongs to my boss and i owe thousands
531352 everyone thinks that i am this terribly successful saleswoman living the high life and i am far too afraid of what theyll think of me if i admit im not what i seem so i have just adapted things to try and maintain the image while gradually easing myself back into the black it could take a long time but i am determined that i will do it and with a little support and a lot of discipline i can
531353 we looked at sarahs monthly expenditure and started to work with her on where she could cut back and reassign the cash to a creditor she is very focused and we are impressed with the discipline she has shown
531354 sarahs best friend was one of the few people she confided in and her friend has since handed her notice in on the apartment she was renting and has moved in with sarah contributing towards her mortgage and sharing two of sarahs friends went to barcelona for a long weekend last month and she told them that she had a family commitment three months ago shed have paid for her flights and all of the champagne and shopping on her credit card and not given it a second thought
531355 confiding in marie was the best thing i could have done she was furious with me for hiding it she was paying to rent an apartment a couple of miles away and we agreed that we would both be making a valuable saving if she moved in it has saved us a lot of money socialising too we dont meet up for dinner and drinks once a week now because we see each other pretty much every day
531356 sarahs incomings are high but her outgoings can be more
531357 sarah is not alone more than 20 per cent of new moneyfreedom clients in the past six months are in that high tax band bracket in that she can work hard and play hard and become the victim of her own success the difference is that sarah has opened her eyes to the situation and is making every effort to resolve the situation while too many people are telling themselves that it will get better but economics experts have predicted that it will get worse before it gets better and those who dont act now will really find it difficult to claw their way out if they wait until then

531407 do not put those unwanted ingredients in your pie imagine yourself as a chef in an extremely well stocked kitchen that contains every imaginable ingredient let us say that you have a clear idea of the culinary creation you desire and you understand how to combine these easily accessible ingredients in order to fulfill your desire and as you proceed there are many ingredients that are not appropriate for your creation so you do not utilize them but you also feel no discomfort about their existence you simply utilize the ingredients that will enhance your creation and you leave the ingredients that are not appropriate for your creation out of your pie some of the ingredients in this well stocked kitchen are harmonious with your creation and some of them are not but even though adding some of these ingredients to your creation would absolutely ruin your pie you do not feel the need to push against those ingredients or to ban them from the kitchen because you understand that there is no reason for them to end up in your pie unless you put them in it and since you are clear about which ones enhance your creation and which ones do not enhance it you feel no concern about the great variety of ingredients that exist

531462 we havent changed the direction of the development were making the ps3 version first and then porting to the 360 later
531463 this new picture reveals that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known and underscores the challenges in confronting this disease
531464 these data which are based on new laboratory technology developed by cdc provide the clearest picture to date of the us hiv epidemic and unfortunately we are far from winning the battle against this preventable disease
531465 we as a nation have to come together to focus our efforts on expanding the prevention programs we know are effective
531466 while the level of hiv incidence is alarming stability in recent years suggests that prevention efforts are having an impact
531467 only a week after the bad press coverage regarding the linux related bugs in a number of motherboards released by foxconn which turned out to be the ami bios that several board makers use foxconn is the first vendor out with a publicly released test patch that repairs the bulk of the problems allowing kernel 2
531468 and then the white man came he brought some bad things and some good things for example the white man taught us to knit
531469 la realidad indica que no hemos conseguido ganar hasta el momento de local tras campeonar en el apertura pero creo que el resultado final fue justo ya que por momentos jugamos bien y por otros se nos complic fue bastante parejo
531470 cuando nos toque el partido de copa pensaremos en el partido de copa cuando nos toca un partido del campeonato pensamos en el campeonato

531473 antes se sab a de la existencia de las luces durante un terremoto pero se desconoc a qu las originaba ahora con esta relaci n matem tica hay prueba evidente de una relaci n directa entre las ondas s smicas con las luces del terremoto lo que confirma que los destellos son provocados por el movimiento s smico

531476 this saturday morning i was watching cnn and even if i dont understand english that well i saw that something strange was going on
531477 it is sincerely bad that some media reports preceded the governments announcement
531478 if the foreign ministry received communication from the us government then it should either report to the prime ministers office or make a public announcement
531479 i think it is extremely regrettable that the information was delayed
531480 even if it was a very minor leak we would like to have a firm grasp of the information we want to explain to local citizens consistently
531481 even if the leak this time is not dangerous i want that kind of accident to never happen
531482 this new picture reveals that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known and underscores the challenges in confronting this disease
531483 these data which are based on new laboratory technology developed by cdc provide the clearest picture to date of the us hiv epidemic and unfortunately we are far from winning the battle against this preventable disease

531487 in pakistan terrorism and its sanctuaries are gaining a deeper grip as demonstrated by the tragic assassination of
531488 no clever arrangement of bad eggs ever made a good omelet
531489 as prime minister i bear ultimate responsibility for every decision there are many excellent people in the country and together with them i have championed far reaching daring and complex processes most of them are unknown to the majority of the public but they are well known to those who were part of the decision making and operational process
531490 we must leave the small considerations aside and create unity both inwardly and outwardly
531491 i believe that the internal divisions we have become accustomed to and the idea that different parties have such extremely different ideologies and agendas is a thing of the past and is no longer the case there is a common agenda that every party can put forward on political issues and also on dealing with the threats we face
531492 kadima is a party of failures we must let the public choose particularly at such a critical juncture we need to let the people decide who will lead them
531493 assembling such a government will serve many interests in the knesset but not the interests of the country the current government is dysfunctional its make up is wrong the coalition is unstable people are undisciplined and there is utter anarchy in votes
531494 i have to deal with the stupidest fucking guy on the planet almost every day
531495 empres rios baianos chegaram a pedir ao governador da bahia jaques wagner pt o cancelamento do suposto acerto com a odebrecht
531496 you are listening to relevant radio where music matters relevant radio where music matters
531497 wow maybe there was an ancient living planet there once
531498 welcome to wal mart would you like to take this basket
531499 heres a 100k get out of our hair now we can actually operate w out you go buy yourself some training so you can be successful else where by the way when you are finished w your training youll be competing with people half your age for your next job and the companies will definitely hire some older people due to affirmative action but do they really want to hire the whole plethora of 40 and 50 somethings that will be thrown their way i mean higher health care cost more likely to retire sooner and milk our pension funds yeah we better just hire the bear minimum of these pretty soon to retire folks i mean if they were that useful wouldnt the last company have kept them
531500 hi im tom hanks and im here because the government blew its credibility
531501 drilling is out of the question because cheaper oil is not worth the possibility of damaging our precious landscapes or wildlife and we need to cut fossil fuel use because of global warming and high gas prices are the best thing to make that happen
531502 if something like bush lifting the ban on offshore drilling can cause oil to plummet by 16 barrel just think what 3 5 million new barrels onto the market would do
531503 but the u s energy information administration an independent statistical agency within the department of energy concluded that new oil from anwr would lower the world price of oil by no more than 1 44 per barrel and possibly have as little effect as 41 cents per barrel and would have its largest impact nearly 20 years from now if congress voted to open the refuge today
531504 but lets say that is true what good is wind or solar going to be in that time frame to power cars you could say electric cars but not in this time frame you cannot replace the hundreds of millions of gas powered cars in the u s within this time frame can you explain what is going to happen to the batteries from the hundreds of millions of cars when they wear out
531505 replacing hundreds of millions of gas power cars within this time frame
531506 access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030
531507 do you think oil companies would sell oil to us consumers for one cent less than they could get from french consumers no where oil comes from has no effect on price
531508 then there are the distribution concerns and as youve mentioned battery concerns as it is well known that these batteries are every bit as bad for the environment as our other resources
531509 if something like bush lifting the ban on offshore drilling can cause oil to plummet by 16 barrel just think what 3 5 million new barrels onto the market would do
531510 every barrel of anwr oil production reduces crude oil imports by about a barrel
531511 then you say in 30 years gas will be 12 a gallon if this drilling will not effect the price of oil dont you think gas will not increase more than 2 a gallon over a 15 20 year period
531512 as for car batteries let me clear up my statement i was talking about the batteries that will be in electric cars have you thought about how to dispose of those
531513 as for you so called correction about transmission lines going to the
531514 does it not matter to you that gas produced in america will keep the u
531515 every barrel of anwr oil production reduces crude oil imports by about a barrel
531516 looks like the dems would rather go on a five week vacation than debate what to do about the price of gas
531517 new oil from anwr would lower the world price of oil by no more than 1 44 per barrel and possibly have as little effect as 41 cents per barrel and would have its largest impact nearly 20 years from now if congress voted to open the refuge today
531518 i assume this would also be true for ocs oil
531519 da outra vez transmiti a minha vontade mas continuo a ser a mesma pessoa e continuo de corpo e alma no sporting se for para outro clube este ano ou no pr ximo continuarei a ser o mesmo acho que isso que as pessoas que me aplaudiram sabem e sentem os que confiam em mim aplaudiram me os outros passam me ao lado

531525 im driving that truck over there do you really want me to drive up
531526 chock full of nutritional messages and of course very cheesy
531527 best to have never won a major the label he shed in 2004 at the masters and the wgc events are not nearly as prestigious as the majors
531528 they started midway through my career so i havent given them the priority like i do a major or care about like a major said mickelson who has skipped four of the wgcs held overseas
531529 but they are always the best fields in the game theyre always on great golf courses theyre always on tough tests so i think theres a lot of merit to whoever wins those
531530 im certainly overdue appleby said after a birdie on the final hole for a 67
531531 ive been a long time doing this so it would be nice
531532 im proud that ive won on every tour basically i havent won a world golf championship so it would mean a lot and obviously give me a massive amount of confidence going into the next week
531533 i think it will be a fun shootout mickelson said
531534 a few short putts here and there would have made a big difference singh said
531535 sometimes it doesnt go your way sometimes somebody else plays a little bit better
531536 all four of us are playing well mickelson said of the leaders and appleby
531537 i expect at least one and probably two or three us to have good rounds in the 60s tomorrow and force the guys behind us to catch up with birdies
531538 im going through a hard time and for my grandkids that they will be safe im having a hard time with my apartment

531546 her first words were that she was very happy to see nice people she was very pleased with that she was ecstatic about that
531547 when clark left the apartment he was immediately placed under arrest by fbi agents simultaneously agents made their way to the apartment to find reigh at approximately 3 29 p m reigh was located alone in the apartment where she was reportedly excited to see the law enforcement officials her appearance has not been altered and reigh appears to be unharmed
531548 investigators continue their efforts to try to determine clark rockefellers true identity
531549 there are no guilty pl easures either you like it or you dont
531550 mmmm impressive but no thanks i already have a sharpie
531551 it is difficult to justify paying more per km for the land portion than the sea portion where the engineering challenges are greater also at a time when malaysians are being asked to tighten their belts giving a hefty contract to a glc would not have gone down well
531552 youre not special youre not powerful youre not connected youre not clever youre not important
531553 we wanted to break the format and do something different particularly after how powerful the climax was with the death of two major characters
531554 so were telling one big story in season 3 and putting the
531555 it was a really difficult decision behind the scenes because we love them as people we love having them around and they were great characters you cant keep doing that where the team doesnt die week after week after week year after year youve got to show what the stakes are
531556 i have to say when i was told about the storyline i kind of agreed
531557 obviously i was kind of sad and sort of depressed in that sense about im going to miss everyone and the character but i think with her i think she really came full circle and she went through so much and it felt just right
531558 id be in a mall or wherever and people would come up saying ive never cried so much
531559 but there is a tiny part of me that kind of prefers she does stay dead
531560 its a big show for bbc america and its a show they are really proud of and it works really well i dont exactly know what that means in physical numbers but it gets a lot of airtime and it gets a lot of coverage
531561 i wish one day you would tell me you have some secret real loving feelings for me instead of just the sex talk all the time i have never let anyone use me like i let you i know i am worth more than just sex yet i always crawl back to you each and every time you are my weakness should i forgive myself for letting someone blatantly take advantage of me
531562 this is a dream job working on a dream show but its all a bit crazy the other day i was driving an arial atom which can go from 0 to 60 in in 3 3 seconds to be paid to do that is a joke
531563 its like im just waiting for somebody to take this lollipop from me
531564 my bad boy days are absolutely behind me now ive grown up since then
531565 i was paid to mess around on air when you can only mess around with music or people but now im paid to mess around with cars instead
531566 i did a pilot for another show about my 50p car where id rung up manufacturers asking for parts to build a car and they filmed me fiddling about with it
531567 channel five saw it featured in the birmingham mail so i guess ive got the paper to thank for my new job
531568 and then out of the blue my agent phoned saying channel five wanted a new presenter for fifth gear
531569 a once mighty industrial city is staggering because of the decline of the big three north american automakers and fierce global competition

531585 michele knows where all the bodies are buried not literally of course but what she knows is bad enough to bring heather down in flames

531588 bob has spent his life helping those with miserable and poor lives back home all peaches has done is act like the spoiled little rich kid

531593 the upcoming mpc meeting is likely to be the most difficult the committee has ever had
531594 can they afford to hike rates when the economy is almost certainly going into recession can they afford not to hike rates when they are going to publish a forecast that cpi inflation will rise to about 5 per cent in the coming months
531595 on balance we go for unchanged rates but it is a close call
531596 russians have been in london for some time because its close to moscow and its very international and you have seen them active in the property market
531597 companies from the cis form an ever greater part of the london stock market index
531598 and russian oligarchs are increasingly invested in it themselves through investment funds
531599 i think most russian companies understand that good corporate governance enhances value but because of the size of the russian resources industry there are many companies that are heavily influenced by the state
531600 there are different agendas at play bp shareholders have benefited tremendously from the deal but it looks like they will get less of the benefits of the joint venture in the future and more of the money will stay in russia
531601 we will lose about 1 2 million yuan about pounds 90 000
531602 lots of my clients used to visit to source their products directly a letter of recommendation from me was enough
531603 the trade fairs are empty yiwu the worlds biggest wholesale market has seen sales drop 70 per cent to 80 per cent
531604 uncertainties and destabilising factors in the international environment are increasing
531605 as for the shutdown people knew and saw it coming the effect of the olympics on the overall chinese economy is zero
531606 we increased production 30 per cent in june and july
531607 then it will go higher again in october perhaps 40 or 50 per cent higher than october last year
531608 he did exactly what he said he was going to do
531609 this was one of the best managed businesses we have ever come across with excellent board papers and a strong strategic focus
531610 there are many niche plastics businesses that were set up in the 1970s and 1980s by individuals who are now looking to get out
531611 we have spent five years building up the database of potential deals
531612 we are always looking for businesses with nice but not rapid growth
531613 we are now looking to do two or three acquisitions per year
531614 move much closer to the industry average in the coming months
531615 edf believes it has made a full offer and is not convinced it wants to get involved with this all over again
531616 to be a major actor in the nuclear rebirth of britain
531617 i have always believed that this industry actually has the ability if its properly managed led and funded to deliver a fantastic service that we would all be proud of
531618 this is all about creating an experience on public transport thats genuinely different
531619 we tend to be very good operators as transport companies and maybe less good at saying right lets actually produce exactly what customers want not what suits us thats changing and its changing in a very positive way
531620 i felt i couldnt turn down the sra job and i had a great time there we did a huge amount to turn around britains railways back in the early part of this decade and now yes i do love being back in the private sector
531621 i cant deny that and its a great company with huge potential i think of it as three great opportunities theyve all been different and theyve all been fulfilling
531622 the trouble with corporate america today is that everything is thought of in quarters
531623 the fact that we are taking this step now when the market conditions are weak and the value of all companies are down shows our commitment to the long future of building kkr
531624 the markets are so terrifyingly unreliable at the moment most people on wall street are struggling with damage limitation and kravis is launching a listing ill give it to him hes certainly contrarian and a braver man than i
531625 this is about a worldview of where private equity is going there are going to be those that remain the traditional local firms and then there will be six or seven big global operators that will lead world investing those in the superleague see being public as part of their professionalisation as well as a fuel for growth kkr is frankly falling behind it cannot afford to delay its progress because of market conditions
531626 the fixed income business should be a growth engine for us
531627 over the summer months from july to september we find our visitors are predominantly from arab countries
531628 we arranged this event specifically to coincide with the holiday period and we hope it will become a yearly event we specifically cater for middle eastern customers with facilities such as private dining rooms for women where we can provide them with all female staff if they require
531629 we expect trade between britain and the gcc to increase significantly over the next five years
531630 we are specifically targeting middle eastern investors especially in dubai
531631 we are creating high quality psychoacoustics which can include the sound of a luxury spa for a bathroom or even the call to prayer five times a day certainly within three years we hope to be turning over 3 4m and gcc states play a central part in that ambition
531632 our target is to get to 10m customers by the end of the decade
531633 its not going to be easy but its not so long ago people were saying we wouldnt get to 8m now we are at nearly 9m
531634 we are not obsessing about a number for no reason
531635 year after year target after target has been blown away that doesnt seem to be happening this time no one believes there is scope to grow beyond 10m
531636 you pay premiums for growth stocks and discounts for utilities
531637 but next year and the year after are going to be tough
531638 its more efficient to keep a customer than to have to get a new one
531639 we have been working closely for a couple of months with stone point capital to evaluate options for the firm no decision has been made
531640 the amount of cash that companies have at their fingertips is contracting at an even faster rate than it did during the last recession in the early 1990s
531641 companies are running down their cash holdings and borrowing more
531642 put the two together and it is clear that they are suffering they are also drawing down their existing facilities without arranging or being able to arrange new ones this liquidity squeeze is likely to be reflected in cutbacks in investment and employment
531643 as one enters a recession companies faced with increasing cash flow difficulties draw down money held on deposit but continue borrowing as long as the banks let them this is happening again
531644 its clear that there will be an earthquake but like a geophysicist before a quake its impossible to know for sure how bad it will be
531645 when banks dont have enough money to lend to each other why should they lend to anyone else
531646 this recession started in the housing market but it is spreading like a virus and now it is the corporate sector facing severe pressure this is a very worrying further step towards the edge of the cliff
531647 their liquidity was eaten away by their derivatives trades but they have a strong portfolio of businesses
531648 in the current market it is not easy to sell the best way of approaching it is discreetly to the small group of investors that have equity to spend
531649 but they do not expect completion until september at the earliest
531650 it seems unlikely that the russians would be happy about an indian or chinese company buying imperial investors dont want to chance it
531651 we are looking at this as part of the overall picture
531652 severe commodity inflation credit issues and slowing economies will challenge all of us
531653 our performance by the end of the year gives us confidence that we can continue to generate both absolute profit growth as well as margin improvement
531654 the next stage in the evolution of our integrated finance strategy is the creation of a fund enabling other investors typically long term partners of bank of scotland to invest alongside the group in specific companies the bank has an ongoing relationship with
531655 this will be done by placing selected portions of equity from key investments into the fund we will be inviting key investment partners to participate by investing in the fund alongside the bank
531656 we believe barclays could easily find that its entire recent capital raising is wiped out by such writedowns

531670 we havent changed the direction of the development were making the ps3 version first and then porting to the 360 later
531671 im telling them to not think about the xbox 360 right now
531672 we can think about it after the development kits arrive

531676 the sad truth is that the fcc is ill equipped to detect isps interfering with your internet connection

531684 this is a crisis we have to deal with this issue
531685 it will make a difference not only in the housing market but in the entire economy
531686 there is no arrangement on this and those stories are not accurate
531687 in moral terms government cannot stand aside and watch families being driven into fuel poverty
531688 i urge the prime minister to come out of his bunker and tackle the deflationary forces in the economy action must be taken to resurrect consumer confidence
531689 there is room for manoeuvre in fiscal policy and a substantial economic boost is necessary for example the net borrowing forecast for this year was 43bn the equivalent figure in the last downturn in 1992 93 was 68 2bn
531690 the biggest windfall gainer offshore is the chancellor himself whose oil revenues are heading for 15bn in the current financial year
531691 its time that the snp played their part in supporting under pressure scots co operation is the way forward for scotland not conflict for conflicts sake
531692 salmonds megaphone diplomacy will not make any scottish home warmer or greener
531693 scotland has proved more resistant to financial pressures than other parts of the uk however with deflationary forces becoming stronger by the day scotland is not immune to the economic downturn
531694 when you look at why a politician like david does something its all about those who are pushing him
531695 if you do something like that you basically have to regurgitate the old line about gordon being the best man to lead us through tough times blah blah for david not to even mention brown in the piece was extraordinary
531696 the truth is this you dont do what he did unless youre up to something
531697 by doing what he has done now he has established himself as a player rather than the passive figure he was up till now nobody can now say he hasnt got the balls we knew he had the youth and the charisma he is regarded as a player internationally now he has the politics too to go with it
531698 itll all be about who is lunching with the general secretary of unite and who is sitting next to the head of unison
531699 he is so obvious a successor that gordon cant do it
531700 its going to be like the old days when you had browns leadership speech followed by blairs except now its miliband
531701 not since bobby charlton fought arthur scargill over a comb has there been advertisement a more futile contest
531702 the person who would close an eye to centuries of labour struggle to improve the quality of life for all
531703 i have to say i think the leader in scotland needs to have a much wider voice a much more influential voice and a much stronger voice thats what i intend to say during the campaign
531704 there was a cabinet meeting when jack had to make a phone call to brown to check that everything was ok you cant carry on having that kind of thing happening
531705 you always get the impression from mps that in terms of policy they are the top dogs so if gordon brown appoints des browne then he is the top dog in scotland the job cannot be seen as secondary in importance the leader in the scottish parliament has to be primary
531706 it is madness for andy to have to have a dividing line with london labour this kind of thing drove henry mcleish and it drove jack and it has got us precisely nowhere we need someone to change the record
531707 we would just be moving towards an snp mark 2 if that is andys position then a lot of people will be thinking twice about giving him their support
531708 its an odd strategy to say that i will take on salmond by launching an attack on my own party
531709 i dont think its for me or other mps to offer backing
531710 lets not forget this vote is for the leader of msps at holyrood not for the leader in scotland
531711 the thing about cathy is that she knows how to tickle the partys erogenous zone
531712 this is the minister who backed privatisation at every step now she is left wing after all
531713 if any of these three went into their local tesco youd have to wonder whether anyone would know who they were
531714 you can support us or leave to our fate but if they come for us and all hope is gone we will turn the middle east into a radioactive wasteland until the end of time
531715 we heard some noise outside and then the door literally burst in and the dea came in in full combat gear told everybody to get on the floor and put their hands behind their heads
531716 giving comprehensible and appropriate information about survival benefit is extremely difficult however the reluctance to address these difficulties and sensitivities may be hampering patients ability to make informed decisions about their future treatment
531717 id like all patients with incurable cancer to have the information they need to make a decision about whether to have this treatment
531718 but this needs nationally agreed and regularly updated statistics and earlier conversations with their doctor about the pros and cons of treatment in the last month
531719 at the moment much depends on the doctor you see
531720 this small but interesting study sheds some light on the particular difficulties in communicating information about palliative chemotherapy treatment decisions
531721 what we are going out to do is to learn
531722 this is our last opportunity to visit a summer games before london 2012 itself
531723 we are going to learn about the issues around providing healthcare for athletes and spectators in a live summer games
531724 i am just going to see the medical side of it
531725 it is a case of fly in work round seeing how the hospitals are set up how the care for the athletes in the villages is set up and how the care for the spectators is set up
531726 then we can bring all of our experiences together and collate them and make sure that the things we identify we can solve before london 2012 happens
531727 i think we see people playing tennis every time wimbledon is on but what we fail to do is sustain that enthusiasm
531728 people get interested for a while what we need to do after the olympics is to ensure that interest is sustained
531729 everyone will be getting into the swimming pool or cycling or jogging round the track during the olympics or a short time afterwards but we need to ensure that is sustained
531730 it is about setting real achievable goals for people and accepting the idea that most people who compete are not going to win the 100m
531731 if you can get the schools local community and parents interested you will crack a lot of the obesity problems
531732 there are so many sports that people will look at and think i want to do that and maybe they will join a local club
531733 you want people to think well of you dont you
531734 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity
531735 as the commission finds are necessary to diminish eliminate or prevent such burden
531736 if you did it by hand first and scanned it
531737 this guy has a fool proof way to get out of your phone plan and possibly into a iphone plan with at amp t
531738 of 12 reports of convulsions or hyponatremia following the use of desmopressin nasal spray seven involved children under 13 years of age
531739 avoidance of excessive fluid intake should be advised during treatment with desmopressin
531740 the ongoing need for these products should be reviewed periodically in patients taking desmopressin long term
531741 the first truly open and comprehensive platform for mobile devices
531742 i dont think theres anything that would preclude us from working together how we cooperate thats the question
531743 are a rattly ship where theres no control over where these platforms are going
531744 the problem right now is there are too many open source players
531745 it doesnt make sense in a marketplace to have multiple vendors doing the same thing if you combine all that effort into one you should have a lot more effect
531746 more feasible for android to merge with limo than with symbian because the technology underpinnings are the same
531747 there are clear competitive reasons why nokia which owns all the intellectual property and will be the biggest contributor to the open source symbian foundation has no commercial incentive at all to work with google
531748 with the exception of the police and the military the family is perhaps the most violent social group and the home is the most violent social setting in our society a person is more likely to be hit or killed in his or her home by another family member than anywhere else or by anyone else
531749 more people in america are murdered each night in their beds than on the street
531750 son resultado de la lucha sostenida durante mucho tiempo por el pueblo boliviano
531751 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
531752 should serve as a wake up call that the us hiv aids epidemic is far from over
531753 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
531754 they used to separate out my plate my spoon my cup fearing they would catch aids for me that was the lowest point how is such a thing possible
531755 the kind of experience which alejandro was subject to is common
531756 the intolerance is everywhere and people have very few choices where they can go it is a hidden suffering
531757 it is very difficult in a small place like this
531758 i felt companionship we became a family where we could share and where there was no fear of rejection of isolation
531759 it is a tragic irony that those at highest risk of hiv often receive the least attention
531760 the conference cannot be another talking shop that regurgitates what is needed in order to win the battle against the hiv epidemic
531761 a plan of action and a clear political will to win the war against hiv and aids must come out of it
531762 you dont need to disrespect yourself again dont hide your light behind your fear

531829 die gegend ist eine kriegszone wir verlangen dort eine waffenruhe damit wir sie freilassen k nnen
531830 seien auf einem berg der region freigelassen worden und dort etwa eine halbe stunde sp ter von sicherheitskr ften gefunden worden
531831 whatever is happening from the economic side there is a huge amount of potential when people talk about scotland i dont want them to think about kilts and tartan i want them to be talking about food and drink
531832 yes you might mention deep fried mars bars but people still talk about scotch whisky scotch beef and scottish lamb its about talking up the positives look at macsweens people talk about that product all over the world
531833 wouldnt it be nice if people in england started asking for scotch beef and scottish salmon ahead of their own produce wouldnt it be great if we could start welcoming food tourists on a big scale
531834 we want to achieve the ambition of creating scotland as a land known throughout the world for its quality of food and drink
531835 its not a talking shop we are not just about marketing we are here to deliver constructive working projects on behalf of the industry
531836 the rising input costs are certainly having an impact across the whole industry we are saying that by harnessing the strengths of the scottish food and drink industry we can be more secure in our future and by working collaboratively we can find the best solutions
531837 obviously if you go through something like that you learn a great deal dasani was a fantastic product and in consumer tests it always went down really well i still think it is a fantastic product and in the us it is the number two water product
531838 when i was at university food wasnt really on the radar but coming back to glasgow i cant believe how much the byres road has changed its peppered with delis and caf s
531839 there is a real food culture there now its not just young professionals there are a lot of students who see it as a viable career
531840 in march we were in mid process of licensing the stores and the whole development of beanscene was more about the evening experience
531841 the first thing i have to do is to get my head around what has happened in the last four months and look at the performance of the business
531842 my phone has been white hot all week so the opportunities are opening up by the day whether that be through banking a joint venture or more traditional routes to funding but my belief in the potential and future of beanscene is bullet proof
531843 people talk about recession and the end of the coffee boom and starbucks in retreat but beanscene was always more than just coffee

531917 i talked to her after the olympic trials and told her nobody can ever take this away you are representing the united states at the olympics i dont think it will even hit her until later
531918 it wasnt in the cards for us to take jakes two sisters said deitchlers father jason
531919 the coaches called us up and said well do whatever we can to help the support weve gotten from so many people is really humbling
531920 we couldnt go to the olympic trials so we watched it on the internet said kathy koob one of the founders of the ali cats
531921 pretty soon 20 people showed up at our house and huddled around the computer to watch it with us weve watched ali since she was a little girl and we know how much she loves wrestling and the blood and sweat and tears shes put in were all cheering for her

532004 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
532005 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
532006 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
532007 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
532008 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
532009 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government
532010 i detest what you write but i would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write
532011 and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too
532012 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
532013 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
532014 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
532015 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
532016 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
532017 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
532018 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
532019 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
532020 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
532021 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american

532078 re virtual appliances a new virtualization format has been developed by the kensho project for virtual appliances a key element of the virtualization concept is a hypervisor or virtual machine monitor which is a virtualization platform that allows multiple operating systems to run on a host computer at the same time since there are several types of hypervisors from different software vendors the kensho project setup a project team to neutralize the hypervisor marketplace by creating the open virtual format ovf by creating ovf the virtual environment becomes more manageable for systems designers by allowing numerous applications to run efficiently regardless of which hypervisor you deploy the ovf will become a part of the service oriented architecture in september of this year
532079 re cpmc the sutter cpmc comment is interesting since back in december 2007 sutter tagged cpmc cio jerry padavano as the emr transformation vice president for all of mother sutter st lukes cpmcs sister facility is in trouble financially but it would not be surprising for any bay area hospital to pull away from sutter which has a much stronger branding in the sacramento area marin general is seeking a divorce from sutter in the biggest cash transfer since sutter health and marin general hospital joined forces in the mid 1990s sutter nabbed nearly 39 million from the greenbrae hospital last year the controversial transfer has sparked another point of contention as the two parties seek to end of their long troubled relationship critics see it as a sign that sutter is trying to milk marin generals profits before handing control back to the marin healthcare district in a year or two i guess the sutter tag line with you for life doesnt always ring true and i guess there are things that you do not want with you for life anyway

532081 re ethical dilemmas 1 if you think someone would provide a good read then it seems reasonable to let them have an audience asking employees to have public statements reviewed by the pr department is old school but hardly sinister likewise the policy of not responding to rumors is a plausible one since once you respond denying a rumor it is hard to stop responding 2 if a company offers a division ceo and then withdraws the offer you dont have any obligation to interview a replacement in fact you might share the company name with us just to keep the pr department on their toes

532140 and i so love to hear you talk about your conversations with the momma i feel closer to her as a result of them delicious stories for my soul it is so blissful to feel you back here
532141 im not going to have students what would i teach
532142 may you live as long as you wish and love as long as you live
532143 you are being very brave to walk through this and you need not walk alone
532144 i just need you to sit here with me what i am expereincing right now really sucks and soon i will do the work that is required so that i may heal from this and be more whole but right now i just need to be where i am and i need not to have to be here by myself please do not try to fix me do not try to make this go away do not invalidate that it really sucks just sit here with me in this pain until i am ready to work through it
532145 the lesson really is that in considering a case of this complexity the police and those responsible for the prosecution need to keep an open mind as far as possible as to who might be responsible
532146 i think they did close their minds after the arrest of barry george yes there was a feeling that he was somebody who filled the likely description of who might be a suspect for such a case all these cases that attract widespread publicity put huge pressure on the police and the prosecuting authorities to try to find the perpetrator and i sometimes feel that pressure distorts the objectivity that would otherwise be present it seems to be abandoned
532147 an awful lot of work by many dedicated and experienced officers went into presenting this case its to be expected that people connected with george are now coming out to attack the police
532148 we are disappointed by todays verdict but especially disappointed for jills family and friends however we respect the decision of the court
532149 the investigation into her murder was complex thorough and professional with more than 2 500 statements taken and 3 700 exhibits recovered i would like to thank the members of the public who came forward following the murder to give us information in particular those who gave evidence in court
532150 i think he would be like a fish out of water in ireland i think hell stay in london but he wont go back to fulham he wont want to go back there after everything that has happened
532151 at the moment barry isnt angry hes just happy to be out
532152 i suppose that anger could come at a later stage
532153 when the jury came back in at 2 oclock i was very surprised their faces were really serious which i thought was a bad sign we were braced for a guilty verdict when he the foreman said not guilty it was a hell of a shock
532154 i was shaking i got more of a shock than if he had been found guilty we were prepared for the worst were absolutely delighted
532155 when i saw him first after the verdict he just put his hands in the air
532156 it was pretty anonymous and people didnt seem to know who we were i had a cup of tea and barry had one drink
532157 hes not a drinker but he decided to have one it was some kind of fancy little thing a cocktail
532158 his friends were ringing him i think he was struggling to believe it himself he was really delighted he was just smiling and shaking his head i dont think ive ever seen him as happy
532159 he has consistently denied killing jill dando i have had the opportunity to observe him closely on a regular basis and i have seen how he reacts when he becomes very distressed it just doesnt fit in with somebody who would be able to maintain a face for such a long time
532160 with people who are intellectually challenged its likely they will have other difficulties such as poor memory and poor executive resources mr george is just not an efficient well thought out person who can do things quickly
532161 i was initially introduced to him by the defence as part of the team to assess him we felt he needed somebody to help support him through the trial as he was having difficulty following it if he got confused about something or missed a piece of information i would explain that to him
532162 i also helped him with anxiety management techniques to help cope with the trial
532163 now he will go back to doing exactly what he was doing before he was arrested stalking and harassing women

532183 very important that the fbi present their case against bruce and not just state that the investigation was over because it was him and hes gone
532184 im concerned about what closing this case without conclusive evidence might do to harm our life sciences enterprise i think we as americans need to see the proof
532185 its a shame the man is not here with us we might have known more
532186 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure

532212 how to build games that are important that address the human condition but are still good games
532213 mainstream games are conflicted works people can sense this games don t resonate if the work is disharmonious how can we remove this conflict that s built into our games and what is it
532214 understanding your play session as it unfolds in front of you
532215 changing the design elements changes the metaphorical meaning of any game experience adding and subtracting the rules you can move from any game to any game
532216 gameplay elements have meanings outside of the visual and linear the meaning of the gameplay rules is often in conflict within the visual meanings from the linear meanings which results in a game becoming conflicted
532217 we are a young medium because we ve yet to come to understand this
532218 this is disingenuous and robs the game of its emotional impact and potential
532219 in other words doors are the obstacles keeping you from the good stuff
532220 these conflicts will happen because of the way that games are constructed

532240 in the current market with no shortage of bad news what we have is fear masquerading as formal analysis
532241 the extreme doomsday scenarios being bandied about lately are causing many in the investment community to consider these outlier events such as the sub prime crisis as normal occurrences that should be incorporated into investment strategies which is a terrible methodology to adopt for investors in the long term this causes investors to suffer because they become locked into an extremely low probability payoff structure
532242 if you compare the present market situation to difficult markets of the past such as the great depression and world war ii investors with a long term investment focus should not be as concerned about this market despite pundits protestations to the contrary
532243 enduring influence that the equity risk premium the long run difference between the equity return and the intermediate treasury bond return and proper diversification will have on their investments returns in the future
532244 history shows that even the scariest markets of the last 77 years did not derail long term market probabilities in the short term markets can be disorienting even deceiving so investors are better placed when they implement more long term oriented investment strategies

532302 there are no youth based graphics theres no crazy music
532303 were contacting all the candidates their tech people and media people
532304 were hoping that with a push from site usage and media attention politicians will agree to answer questions
532305 because they all have something to say and less money to get the message out
532306 the people who ask the questions can interpret the answers
532307 they will see if a candidate avoids the crux of the issue
532308 it will just hurt the candidate if they dont answer the question
532309 coming into this new environment never having lived on my own before ive learned a lot about managing time

532317 hes doing good i mean hes valuable because he can play everywhere
532318 hes a great defensive player and he can get some hits and roll the balls up the middle hes a spark plug he comes to play every day and when hes healthy hes a good player
532319 oh yeah and id match nickys glove with anybody i mean range everything hes all over the field and casilla has done a hell of a job over there but nicky youll match him anywhere defensively in the infield
532320 hes just shortened his swing up and hes got his hands in a better position than he had them last year
532321 hes able to get down on the ball a little bit better and stay and cover the ball
532322 lirianos done what he needed to do to get back up here
532323 hes our future hes our present and our future we needed to get him in the rotation and it was time to do that were going to see what this young man has if he comes back like were hoping he is and the way hes been throwing he can be a huge boost its like getting a big trade right here
532324 i never say rebuilding because youre in the major leagues you rebuild in the minor leagues
532325 but i knew we were going to have to do a lot of teaching of young players and hopefully we could get better as we went along you know what thats what weve done
532326 theyve all come in here with open minds and theyve all gotten after the game thats all we try to do around here get after the game we try to teach and we try to play
532327 theyre getting after it and theyre playing and they have no fear
532328 thats all we care about around here no fear go out and play the game
532329 hes been the hottest hitter in the minor leagues for us hes hitting 300 against lefties
532330 we needed some help against some lefties here monroe struggled against lefties and we need some help against lefties and this young man has been swinging
532331 it seems like any time we need a big hit and somebody to drive in some runs hes stepping up and clearing bases for us its awesome when you see that but we all expect that everyday
532332 the main issue right now is with the ncaa clearinghouse and my sat scores they canceled my last scores
532333 we should be much better i think last year we went through a growth period trying to figure out what we had here we had a bunch of new players but as much as that i think randy foye being hurt for the first half of the season really put us back i think after randy came back we were 17 21 or something like that coming down the stretch for a lot of these guys familiarity is going to make us much much better
532334 i think fans are supporting us right now theyre showing that they want to see this new team this young team
532335 ive seen him play a couple times and ive seen his recruiting process
532336 you guys got a great player there a big guy that can really run the floor and can really score in transition so the gophers should be excited about that one i had a brother that played at northern state in aberdeen s d ryan miller who was a really good basketball player

532348 this new picture reveals that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known and underscores the challenges in confronting this disease kevin fenton director of the cdcs national centre for hiv aids viral hepatitis std and tb prevention
532349 these data which are based on new laboratory technology developed by cdc provide the clearest picture to date of the us hiv epidemic and unfortunately we are far from winning the battle against this preventable disease said cdc director julie gerberding
532350 we as a nation have to come together to focus our efforts on expanding the prevention programs we know are effective she said
532351 while the level of hiv incidence is alarming stability in recent years suggests that prevention efforts are having an impact said richard wolitski acting director of the cdcs division of hiv aids prevention
532352 we have derived an equation that successfully predicted 75 of fractures in women two years after their initial measurements were taken
532353 as the average age of the population increases the number of fractures attributable to osteoporosis is set to increase dramatically
532354 the ability to predict fracture risk based on simple clinical measurements will assist in targeting treatment for people at highest risk thus helping reduce the burden of this disease
532355 there is a lot of work being done in this area because we know that measuring bone density is not the perfect predictor of who will go on to break bones because of osteoporosis
532356 the world health organization is due to publish an international report drawing together all the other risk factors that play a part in assessing how likely it is that someone will break a bone over a 10 year period

532395 we assumed that telemedicine was a good idea but it hadnt been scientifically tested until now
532396 using stroke doc our stroke team physicians were able to evaluate the patient and help make the correct decision about treatment over 98 percent of the time compared to only 82 percent of the time when doing a telephone consultation to a remote site
532397 when a person suffers a stroke time is of the essence
532398 if you make a poor decision using a telephone consultation you potentially put the patient at risk for a poor outcome
532399 the question we set out to ask with this five year study was did we make the right decision the answer was overwhelmingly yes
532400 rural physicians can now provide much needed specialty care to their patients via telemedicine
532401 this is welcome news for rural healthcare providers in the u s
532402 what this study tells us is that we need a bigger trial to determine the difference if any in clinical outcomes for these patients

532414 i think there will at some point be a crisis of legitimacy
532415 the leaders seem to feel that they can get away with a lot of things so long as the masses are satisfied with the economic opportunities given to them
532416 but the economy is so bad that people are losing faith there is a feeling that maybe its time for major changes

532418 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
532419 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
532420 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
532421 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
532422 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
532423 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
532424 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
532425 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
532426 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
532427 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
532428 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
532429 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
532430 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
532431 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
532432 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
532433 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
532434 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
532435 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

532444 it is said the number of appointed senators would be increased by six from five to 11 to create space for appointees who would include tsvangirai and arthur mutambara as leaders of the two mdc factions currently mugabe can only appoint five senators and this room is not enough to accommodate losing zanu pf candidates and unelected mdc officials

532496 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
532497 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
532498 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
532499 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
532500 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
532501 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
532502 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
532503 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
532504 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
532505 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
532506 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
532507 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

532512 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
532513 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
532514 when he was attacking him he was calm like he was at the beach
532515 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
532516 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
532517 he sat in the front at first everything was normal

532522 i think she probably went down head first and landed on her back
532523 i wasnt expecting anybody alive at the bottom of the shaft so i was shocked
532524 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
532525 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
532526 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
532527 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
532528 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
532529 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
532530 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
532531 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
532532 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
532533 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
532534 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
532535 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
532536 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
532537 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
532538 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
532539 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
532540 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
532541 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
532542 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
532543 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
532544 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
532545 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
532546 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
532547 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
532548 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
532549 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
532550 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
532551 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
532552 who are open to doing something on the production side
532553 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
532554 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
532555 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
532556 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
532557 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
532558 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
532559 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
532560 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
532561 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
532562 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
532563 the question mark was would the venues be ready would the organization be ready
532564 come the 9th of august the day after the opening ceremony the magic of the games and the flawless organization will take over
532565 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
532566 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
532567 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
532568 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
532569 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
532570 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
532571 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
532572 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
532573 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
532574 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
532575 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
532576 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
532577 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
532578 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
532579 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
532580 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
532581 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
532582 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
532583 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
532584 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
532585 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
532586 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
532587 has decided to throw in the towel and quit the chipset business
532588 the story on digitimes is completely groundless we have no intention of getting out of the chipset business
532589 mercury research has reported that the nvidia market share of amd platforms in q208 was 60
532590 we have been steady in this range for over two years
532591 people forget my website was once largely just a portal for enlightenment themes the purpose of slashdot is to report on news that matters
532592 in whichever negotiation we take part it is unequivocally with the view to the realization of irans nuclear right and the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights
532593 we have told the european countries that every country including iran has the right to engage in uranium enrichment and to possess nuclear power stations based on agreements
532594 what matters is that we get a clear answer quickly its not a matter of one day
532595 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
532596 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
532597 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
532598 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
532599 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
532600 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up
532601 i was surprised how good the scoring was because standing on the range you felt like the golf course was going to play pretty tough since we didnt get the rain overnight as expected and it felt like it was going to dry out as the day went on
532602 i wanted to come out quick and birdie birdie birdie was obviously great but i played pretty solid all day
532603 it could have been a better round than that but youve got to take what it gives you a few short putts here and there would have made a big difference
532604 im excited that im tied for the lead going into the final round
532605 i think itll be a fun shootout theres four guys right there and then theres a big grouping four shots back
532606 so i think that were all in good position i feel like ive played well the first three rounds and im looking forward to a nice shootout tomorrow
532607 they used to separate out my plate my spoon my cup fearing they would catch aids for me that was the lowest point how is such a thing possible
532608 the kind of experience which alejandro was subject to is common
532609 the intolerance is everywhere and people have very few choices where they can go it is a hidden suffering
532610 it is very difficult in a small place like this
532611 i felt companionship we became a family where we could share and where there was no fear of rejection of isolation
532612 it is a tragic irony that those at highest risk of hiv often receive the least attention
532613 the conference cannot be another talking shop that regurgitates what is needed in order to win the battle against the hiv epidemic
532614 a plan of action and a clear political will to win the war against hiv and aids must come out of it
532615 you dont need to disrespect yourself again dont hide your light behind your fear
532616 i would remind you that falun gong is an evil fake religion which has been banned by the chinese government

532669 we have witness accounts that it did touch down and the pilot was trying to land and during the landing roll out for some reason they made a decision to try to take off and get airborne again

532686 most devout muslims are creationists so when you go to schools there are a large number of children of islamic parents who trot out what they have been taught
532687 teachers are bending over backwards to respect home prejudices that children have been brought up with
532688 the government could do more but it doesnt want to because it is fanatical about multi culturalism and the need to respect the different traditions from which these children come the government particularly under tony blair thinks it is wonderful to have children brought up with their traditional religions i call it brainwashing
532689 it seems as though teachers are terribly frightened of being thought racist
532690 its almost impossible to say anything against islam in this country because if you do you are accused of being racist or islamophobic
532691 some of the immigrant communities insist on sticking to their own culture like the muslims in bradford and so forth and they are extremely dangerous
532692 i do think had my comments been acted on those attacks would have been less likely
532693 ive been opposing the concept of a multicultural society for 10 years or more and thats because a multicultural society is an impossibility
532694 a society is defined by its culture it is not defined by its race it is not a matter of skin colour or ethnicity it is a matter of culture
532695 if you have two cultures in one society then you have two societies if you have two societies in the same place then you are going to have problems like the kind we saw on july 7 sooner or later

532700 im pleased with how our whole team did we came out here and competed really well
532701 all in all there were some good points the touchdown to keller was nice it showcased his abilities a little bit
532702 as im watching this game part of it is watching those guys but part of it is watching all the other new guys part of it is trying to look at the scheme and how those guys are executing the scheme theres a lot of new faces to look at thats really going to come more from the tape than this first look
532703 i just thought the group as a whole did what i was looking for them to do in terms of tempo and effort
532704 kellen put the ball right where it needed to be so there was no thinking or looking back after that
532705 im fine but im not at liberty to discuss injuries
532706 obviously the biggest reason they brought me here was to upgrade the pass rush so that is one of the things i have to get used to

532734 support a holy war against christians jews and other muslims who dont happen to be true believers in the quran according to bin laden
532735 islam means submission to the will of allah a doctrine that requires the individual to become a slave is in my view is bad islam limits the imagination to what you can find in the koran and to follow in the example of the prophet mohammed i think thats bad and thats what keeps people in the islamic world backward islam mistreats women at least subordinates women to men is obsessed with obedience calls for the murder of gays and adulterers and is therefore very violent and inhuman all of this is in the koran all of this is in the hadith and anywhere that islamic sharia islamic rule is implemented you see that these things are carried out
532736 i think its highly exaggerated that muslims in the tell that to the people who believe there have been a couple of stolen elections that the democracy is completely broken that
532737 is there a school where they teach you these american cliches is it part of your application process im sorry im so upset im losing my cards here i cant believe you just said that
532738 ive read de tocqueville and ive read about democracy and ive lived in countries that had no democracy that had no founding fathers that could not resolve so i dont find myself in the same luxury as you you grew up in freedom and you can spit on freedom because you dont know what it is not to have freedom i havent i know that there are many things wrong with and i know there are many things wrong with americans but i still believe its the best nation in the world

532782 i will never trust you again our friendship is over
532783 why do i continually hear others says that youre spreading rumors about me
532784 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
532785 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
532786 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
532787 it began as an adventure and for a long time i felt i was to blame now i realise what an evil pervert he truly is
532788 if i ever saw him again id shake his hand and thank him for making me the strong resilient person i am today
532789 then id turn around and knee him where it truly hurts so hed feel what its like to trust someone and then have it all ripped apart and abused
532790 i think he should never be released i was easy prey for him i was a loner getting bullied at school because of the music i liked kids would shout goth as i walked past i always felt an outsider
532791 i hated school and i hated life at home too i didnt get on with my parents we clashed over my loud music the mess i made and my homework i was so miserable
532792 do you want to be my friend and start chatting
532793 he said he was called toby and after a few days he told me he was 27 so i said i was 17 we exchanged email addresses he told me he lived in america and was in the marines it sounded really interesting
532794 i realised he was old to be playing on a kids game but i never thought there was anything wrong with him we both liked punk and chatted on the internet every day
532795 after a week i told toby my real age and he admitted he was really 31 that didnt worry me by then he was my friend who i shared all my problems with
532796 after three months we exchanged pictures he became my closest friend he always made me feel better by saying hed look after me
532797 he told me how his wife jenny had died of cancer and revealed he was self harming because he was sad and lonely like me i felt sorry for him it was like we were on the same level
532798 he told me he loved me and wanted to marry me one day
532799 he said i was pretty which nobody had done before
532800 we talked by webcam too with the volume down so my parents didnt realise i was talking to a man
532801 i thought he cared he sent me a card with a spaceship on the front which read i wish i could abduct you i hid it in my room
532802 after 10 months toby said he planned to leave the marines and live in the uk he said hed help me escape from my troubles and we could go away together i thought it would be brilliant
532803 i knew he was serious when he asked for my passport number i just thought he was kind and was going to rescue me
532804 i told mum i was going shopping with friends but id saved over 20 in pocket money for a taxi to the airport i was shaking with nerves i packed a bag with three sets of clothes a brush a notebook to write my poetry a phone charger a cd player and cds by the cure
532805 toby walked towards me through the airport wearing a t shirt with gbh on the front gbh were one of my favourite bands and i thought that was cool
532806 he hugged me and took me for coffee hed booked us on a flight to paris and it felt like a mad adventure he said wed have to be careful and keep on the move
532807 toby sat next to me on the bed and kissed me on the lips not a snog but a proper kiss i was shocked but when he said i am going to look after you i felt he really cared
532808 i just thought it was fun i never for a second thought this was to hide my identity
532809 in the afternoon i asked if i could have a drink and toby got me a litre bottle of vodka
532810 i was sat on the bed and he came towards me and said he loved me
532811 i started to feel scared he was touching me and said do you want to i didnt answer i didnt know how to say no
532812 i kept my top on but he took off my bottoms and had sex with me i didnt like it but i had to switch off and let him do it he used a condom and kept telling me how he loved me and i was beautiful
532813 it was then i remember thinking this shouldnt be happening
532814 afterwards i just blocked it out i didnt want to talk about it
532815 that day i should have been on a school trip to camelot theme park
532816 toby laughed and didnt seem concerned it was like a game to him so i laughed about it too
532817 toby said i had to ring home my mum was upset on the phone and said come home we love you everything will be fine toby wont go to prison
532818 it was then i realised that he was going to prison i got angry and put the phone down
532819 eventually we both realised toby had to give himself up and i had to go home
532820 back home i didnt want to talk to the police i felt like i was betraying toby
532821 but i told mum hed made me have sex with him and she made me tell the police
532822 but slowly i realised it was all because of toby
532823 then it dawned on me he was an evil b who ruined my childhood

532834 and whatever has happened this week it has worked now everyone is talking about david miliband as the heir apparent
532835 he would mark a return to the old blair policies that is not going to be helpful in a general election campaign we need to find a unity candidate
532836 hes a brilliant guy but he is not achieving everything he should have done
532837 are they serious about carrying all of this stuff on or is there a bottom line we are in a game of brinkmanship they cannot get rid of him brown so the worst case scenario is they plunge us even deeper into civil war
532838 i would rather work for iain gray than go back into the caves with some of them
532839 i have known cathy too long to nominate her i just dont think shes up to the job shes not bright enough shes an old trot
532840 i dont think it would be a disaster if cathy was elected she has a perfectly valid claim to stand but i believe that iain would make a better leader someone has to stand up to alex salmond and i think iain is more likely to not just cope with him but beat him
532841 i would not sign a blank cheque for alex salmond on a referendum but nor do i believe we should stand in the way of the scottish peoples right to determine their own future

532844 when you have to fight through the pitching problems you normally have problems that usually mean you are struggling you are fighting your butt off to survive and i think were doing it but were working pretty hard

532877 the pins were just not as crazy i think the usga kind of listened to some guys and they did a good job with the setup
532878 some of them yesterday were on the side of slopes and if you got anywhere above the wrong side of the hole you were going to be 20 feet past no matter what

532884 jumbo fha and jumbo conforming loan limits will be reduced from the current 125 of median home value to 115 of the median home value beginning january 1 2009 as i mentioned your days of a loan amount of 567 500 are numbered
532885 you cant know where prices are headed just based on jumbo loan amounts
532886 my purpose for this post is to hit it home what a great window of opportunity we have with fha jumbo mortgages which are only around until december 31 2008 which seems to be suggesting people should hurry and buy now because jumbo loan availability might not be around for much longer
532887 i suppose the real question boils down to this is it better to buy when financing is easy but prices are high or buy when financing is tough but prices are low
532888 it seems likely that future fixed rates the next 3 years lets say are going to be higher than they are at present as the persistence of inflation works its way thru the market
532889 i also expect that mortgage qualification criterion will continue to become tighter leaving fewer and fewer people able to qualify for any loan at all regardless of rate
532890 there is a huge difference about 1 to rate on a larger loan amount between the temporary jumbo rates and the actual jumbo rates
532891 i also expect that mortgage qualification criterion will continue to become tighter leaving fewer and fewer people able to qualify for any loan at all regardless of rate
532892 this is actually a reason for many to consider buying or refinancing sooner than later unless you are a perfect borrower

532954 there is no need to change the decision at this point
532955 this was a considered decision we think it was the right decision this was an important priority of this incoming government that it had focused on this f 16 program but is also committed they say to fighting terrorism
532956 and the argument made was that this mid life upgrade could help them in the fight against terrorism in the tribal areas

532961 treated memory and culture as if they belonged to a sphere beyond the existence of individuals or the control of institutions
532962 let me explain the problem science has with jesus christ
532963 heres one for you lets say theres a sick person over here and you can cure him you can do it would you help them would you try
532964 why not say that you would help a sick and maimed person if you could in fact most of us would if we could god doesnt
532965 he doesnt does he my brother was a christian who died of cancer even though he prayed to jesus to heal him how is this jesus good hmmm can you answer that one
532966 i think were going to have a lot of fun this semester ladies and gentlemen
532967 is there sickness in this world immorality hatred ugliness all the terrible things do they exist in this world
532968 how is it that this god is good if he created all evil throughout all time
532969 all the hatred the brutality all the pain all the torture all the death and ugliness and all the suffering created by this good god is all over the world isnt it young man
532970 science says you have five senses you use to identify and observe the world around you have you ever seen god
532971 have you ever felt your jesus tasted your jesus or smelt your jesus in fact do you have any sensory perception of your god whatsoever
532972 according to the rules of empirical testable demonstrable protocol science says your god doesnt exist what do you say to that son where is your god now
532973 ah another christian in the vanguard come come young man speak some proper wisdom to the gathering
532974 some interesting points you are making sir now ive got a question for you is there such a thing as heat
532975 you can have lots of heat even more heat super heat mega heat white heat a little heat or no heat but we dont have anything called cold we can hit 458 degrees below zero which is no heat but we cant go any further after that there is no such thing as cold otherwise we would be able to go colder than 458 you see sir cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat we cannot measure cold heat we can measure in thermal units because heat is energy cold is not the opposite of heat sir just the absence of it
532976 thats a dumb question son what is night if it isnt darkness what are you getting at
532977 so you say there is such a thing as darkness
532978 youre wrong again sir darkness is not something it is the absence of something you can have low light normal light bright light flashing light but if you have no light constantly you have nothing and its called darkness isnt it thats the meaning we use to define the word in reality darkness isnt if it were you would be able to make darkness darker and give me a jar of it can you give me a jar of darker darkness professor
532979 would you mind telling us what your point is young man
532980 yes professor my point is your philosophical premise is flawed to start with and so your conclusion must be in error
532981 that for example there is life and then theres death a good god and a bad god you are viewing the concept of god as something finite something we can measure sir science cannot even explain a thought it uses electricity and magnetism but has never seen much less fully understood them to view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing death is not the opposite of life merely the absence of it
532982 here is one of the most disgusting tabloids this country hosts professor is there such a thing as immorality
532983 wrong again sir you see immorality is merely the absence of morality is there such a thing as injustice no injustice is the absence of justice is there such a thing as evil
532984 if there is evil in the world professor and we all agree there is then god if he exists must be accomplishing a work through the agency of evil what is that work god is accomplishing the bible tells us it is to see if each one of us will of our own free will choose good over evil
532985 as a philosophical scientist i dont view this matter as having anything to do with any choice as a realist i absolutely do not recognize the concept of god or any other theological factor as being part of the world equation because god is not observable
532986 i would have thought that the absence of gods moral code in this world is probably one of the most observable phenomena going
532987 newspapers make billions of dollars reporting it every week tell me professor do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey
532988 if you are referring to the natural evolutionary process young man yes of course i do
532989 have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes sir
532990 professor since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on going endeavor are you not teaching your opinion sir are you now not a scientist but a priest
532991 ill overlook your impudence in the light of our philosophical discussion now have you quite finished
532992 so you dont accept gods moral code to do what is righteous
532993 sir you rightly state that science is the study of observed phenomena science too is a premise which is flawed
532994 to continue the point you were making earlier to the other student may i give you an example of what i mean
532995 is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the professors brain
532996 is there anyone here who has ever heard the professors brain felt the professors brain touched or smelt the professors brain
532997 it appears no one here has had any sensory perception of the professors brain whatsoever well according to the rules of empirical testable demonstrable protocol science the professor has no brain
532998 when i was 15 years old i shot my high school principal
532999 i want all the social service agencies to listen the schools parents all over the state
533000 i face less abuse in prison than i did at school or at home
533001 a nightmare can you imagine being a kid and hating fearing your parents and your home my dad was charged then let go on abuse the community and family knew he and my adopt ive mom beat me and tortured me they all knew the school and social services and family
533002 the only place i actually felt at home was anywhere but
533003 i would have to pee my pants or pull it out while i ran
533004 i would accept all the beatings if i could have just heard one i love you or good job eric
533005 all i did is take a dried jalape o pepper when he got a filthy mouth and raked it across his tongue
533006 had the courage or even just did their job and got me out of that home i wanted to die i tried to die i wanted to be somewhere else i would dream about laughing and being loved like i saw other families never came true and now it never will
533007 every day the same thing they would call me names in the hall in class at lunch before school and after the teachers all knew this
533008 i would be slapped hit all over my body pushed in bushes or thrown to the ground my head was stuck in dirty toilets sometimes three times a day
533009 i told them two three four times a week every week every year
533010 i complained to that school so many times i was to the point of getting a disorderly conduct and nobody did nothing
533011 because i was a mess not so kids could react or further torment me that would be insane
533012 at least 25 30 kids at weston who bullied me
533013 i asked klang at least three or four times a week to have students leave me alone
533014 i am not in any way overstating the case i hated it i wanted it stopped for crying out loud i brought a gun to school so it would stop
533015 eric was the type of student who tried to relate in maybe somewhat of a clumsy way that didnt always sit well with other students
533016 anytime someone comes in with a complaint or a concern we deal with it pretty seriously
533017 not a day goes by that i dont think cry and dream about what i did to mr
533018 i am not to blame for everything i was 15 and never lived a day of peace or hope
533019 i would not be here today and mr klang would not be dead
533020 is particularly weak in his ability to plan to generate realistic potential future outcomes of various courses of action
533021 as a result he is likely to show poor judgment and generate grossly irrational plans more characteristic of a preteen
533022 he desperately wanted someone to pay attention to how unhappy he was at home and school and do something about it
533023 eric said he had not thought about it but now realizes he would have been arrested for having a gun in school
533024 lots and lots of people in sauk county some who happened to be at weston high school cared and still care about eric
533025 eric didnt get the help that everybody except maybe his father thought he needed
533026 if he didnt find help for this boy he was going to have another columbine on his hands
533027 the adult perspective is that we tried the kid perspective is you abandoned me
533028 what kind of crazy system is that in a rational and humane system you wouldnt have to choose
533029 i would never have been allowed regardless of how grownup i acted or sounded to go to war drink at a bar vote
533030 if this is the justice system i dont want to be part of it anymore
533031 i have it much better in here than i did out there
533032 he listens to me when i get a good grade he puts it on the wall he tells me how good i am and can be he doesnt hit me or call me names like my parents did
533033 he talks to me and lets me talk to him
533034 once again they are attempting to not hear the truth
533035 i hope someday i can see them talk to them tell them how bad i feel and i hope they can forgive me i know it aint easy
533036 i hope and pray you have no mercy on him
533037 she would promise to pick me up for a visit i would pack my little bag and sit at the front step waiting for her she would never come
533038 i dont know how anybody can turn their back on their own child
533039 i would hope for all the love and compassion in the world for the klang family
533040 theyre the same responsibilities that society has to all children to allow them to grow up safe and secure with a sense of self esteem
533041 severe attention deficit problem that needs to be addressed through medication
533042 often hungry because his father would not pay for the discount lunch 30 40 cents

533048 both prime ministers said we need to overcome these problems and move forward
533049 stressed that across the board in pakistan all political parties want improved relations
533050 if they give me evidence then we will look into the matter
533051 since i plan to speak with prime minister singh president hu jintao and already did so with bush we will see if it is possible to return to the negotiating table
533052 it might take a month or two but an agreement is necessary because we need to guarantee for the poorest countries access to the market of the most developed ones
533053 close to reaching an agreement and it did not happen because of minor issues
533054 in case of the continuation of a downward trend in oil price one of the serious discussions in the next opec meeting will be definitely the quotas
533055 opec as the responsible body to control the market should be more meticulous for the control of quotas
533056 the member countries that have increased their capacity should control it the issue is that some countries have been supplying more than their quota

533144 there is no national u s plan that includes not only prevention but also treatment and care
533145 we must recognize this epidemic as the crisis that it is and match our response
533146 the federal response to hiv prevention has unnecessarily endangered tens of thousands of americans
533147 with this new alarming estimate of hiv incidence it would be public health malpractice not to act immediately to drive new infections down there is no excuse to further delay refining and expanding evidence based hiv aids treatment and prevention programs

533187 somewhere mid swing the wind just dropped and that thing flew at least 10 yards further
533188 maybe it was adrenaline or not wanting to be short of that pin it wasnt that bad of a play

533235 at 4 02 in the afternoon i received a call from a my good friend ken rick had somehow heard of kuya dick and was game to do a number with him the producers had gotten in touch with kuya dick and while flattered he felt quite reluctant to do it

533248 its a good thing to stop it im not happy because i thought we could win the race but its right

533261 gang of 10 s plan to potentially open up drilling off of the coasts of florida georgia south carolina north carolina and virginia
533262 i made a general point about the fact that we need to provide the american people some relief and that there has been constructive conversations between republicans and democrats in the senate on this issue
533263 what i will not do and this has always been my position is to support a plan that suggests this drilling is the answer to our energy problems
533264 when im president i intend to keep in place the moratorium here in florida and around the country that prevents oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
533265 thats how we can protect our coastline and still make the investments that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and bring down gas prices for good
533266 i walked with her for a bit and from her perspective maybe it was unwanted attention
533267 but she didnt make that clear it didnt seem like she was telling me to go away if shed told me to leave id have done so straight away
533268 that was at 12 33pm i know because just a minute before id made a call from my mobile to check how much credit i had left
533269 i know i have done wrong in the past and if i could go back in time and change that i would
533270 consumers have the ability to make wise decisions if they face prices that accurately reflect costs firms have just as much ability to innovate in ways that will attract thrifty buyers high prices may be painful but they convey a key nugget of information energy is scarce use it wisely if the government uses tax policy to artificially reduce energy prices then the government will only deter private individuals from appropriate conservation

533276 i came back from kirkuk half an hour ago the situation is very tense there

533287 the course is playing great the pins were a little easier than they were yesterday and the greens were a little softer
533288 the pins were just not as crazy i think the usga kind of listened to some guys and they did a good job with the setup
533289 some of them yesterday were on the side of slopes and if you got anywhere above the wrong side of the hole you were going to be 20 feet past no matter what
533290 today they are a lot more accessible but they are still tough
533291 i think tomorrow the key is going to be the front nine the group of guys that goes out there and lights it up on the front

533306 chester is one of the better backs in this league weve got to find ways to get him out on the field and utilize him obviously we have a very good player in adrian peterson but also we have a very good one in chester taylor the thing about it is there are not enough balls to go around you can only have one but theres room for chester on the field
533307 every week is tough because one guy may get more carries than another
533308 youve got to go in that room on monday and play the role of counselor

533311 the odd quiggan is good mental exercise all part of lifes rich tapestry et al
533312 quiggin strikes me as the stereotype of an australian joyful hearty and not particularly aware of his own strength
533313 his chief delight was drinking cups of coffee at odd hours
533314 i was like ok do i need the bottle with the tilted neck or the bottle with the tube down the middle there were umpteen million bottles and you dont know what you need
533315 we just hold the hands of our clients and walk them through every step
533316 there is information overload now before you walked into a store and could have bought one of two strollers now the options are astronomical
533317 it is bad enough if parents feel like they cant make a decision without consulting a book nobody is willing to trust intuition judgment doing it the way their parents did it it makes child rearing into a nightmare instead of a source of joy which is too bad
533318 when i had questions i literally called her every day i know it sounds stupid but i called about which car seats to get what stroller to get for twins
533319 i can just whip out my laptop and tell them the best strollers based on their lifestyle
533320 a baby should be able to drink the milk whether its warm or cold or you can always boil the bottles in hot water
533321 if i can save you a couple hundred dollars on products you dont need i will let you know
533322 i would have loved it if i could have had some help
533323 my mom could have helped but she didnt know anything up to date she told me to use a washcloth instead of wipes
533324 we havent had a chance to get a handle on where the damage is
533325 i cant believe i let you talk me into this
533326 you i am the fire lord for spirits sake the first vacation i get in months and we had to come here and do this
533327 we all agreed that aang would get to choose our vacation spot this time remember
533328 yeah and i have been wanting to ride the hog monkeys bare back since i got out of the ice
533329 one i get thrown straight into a tree two they all gain up and knock the living boomerang out of me three they try to eat me can you think of anything worst then that
533330 i say go with scenario two that would be the most entertaining
533331 i dont know about that sunshine i think it would be even funnier to see our resident meat man have a large bite mark on him
533332 oh ha ha but if i get all beat up its you that will have to carry me out of this whole mess miss worlds greatest earthbender
533333 not like i havent had to do that before ponytail
533334 ok then we will get the food ready while you boys get the first crack at the monkeys
533335 ok then first you have sneak up on them from behind and make sure that they dont sense you coming or anything
533336 then you jump onto their back and lock your arms around their neck they wont try to grab you or anything they will just try to shake you off easy as that
533337 oh lets just say that sokka found the worst case scenario possible
533338 please dont kill me it was just an accident honest
533339 if you dare try that again without my permission i will send you so far into the ground you will pop out the other side

533341 tim spent his life travelling and meeting new people and always saw the good in everyone
533342 he was a little guy with a heart bigger than you could know
533343 you could hear him laughing a mile away it didnt matter what kind of a day you were having because when you heard him laugh you couldnt help but join in
533344 badger is armed with a knife and a pair of scissors and he is defiling the body at the front of the bus as we speak
533345 operational police communications and as such are not meant for public consumption
533346 okay badgers at the back of the bus hacking off pieces and eating it
533347 that was unusual for him not to call back and then when he didnt show up for work on tuesday we got worried
533348 and then when i found out in the news that li was being pinned for the brutal attack i was in utter shock
533349 i never knew tim and his family but i wish all the best in this awful time
533350 the outpouring of well wishes from complete strangers has been overwhelming
533351 the family appreciates all the love and support from friends loved ones and the public nationwide
533352 as of right now weve seen little to no impact on ticket sales and inter city bus travel continues to be a safe way to travel
533353 they are taught to immediately pull over the bus and call the authorities
533354 there is little justification for any kind of extension out there said zero expansion member mark michelson who also serves on the eden prairie airport advisory commission
533355 user fees should pay for it if they want to expand it they should pay for it
533356 the question should be why hasnt the governor and the legislature reassessed this 20 year old project that no longer reflects what will certainly be a permanent decline in air travel
533357 the plan certainly no longer reflects need nor does it reflect the true noise environmental or economic impacts
533358 we do however work with pilots at the airport to encourage compliance with noise mitigation measures he said
533359 there really is a serious issue about noise price said
533360 they can attempt to accurately monitor but what good is it if they are not penalizing people who are violating the voluntary noise curfew
533361 clean up the airport and modernize it and reflect a better image for eden prairie you come out to the airport now and its like coming back in time a little bit
533362 to do something that has a big budget a great scope with a great director and great actors that has the quality and level of writing and the level of production design is a once in a lifetime opportunity
533363 any actor in his right mind would want to do this film would die to do it

533366 ticketmaster was only selling tickets to the american presidential experience
533367 we apologize for this unfortunate situation and hope to work with people who bought tickets to the experience thinking they were for the obama event
533368 as it developed though we had no control over the change in days the tickets to the american presidential experience were available
533369 i have got to be there i am just trying to figure some way to get into the convention
533370 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
533371 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
533372 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
533373 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
533374 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
533375 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
533376 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
533377 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
533378 this report is modified at the time of ordering and requires 3 5 days to deliver
533379 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
533380 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
533381 wir best tigen den wechsel es ist eine sehr interessante herausforderung f r alparslan erdem man hat ihm bei galatasaray eine gute rolle in der mannschaft in aussicht gestellt nichtsdestotrotz ist sein abgang sehr schade weil er auch bei uns f r den erweiterten kreis vorgesehen war und eine perspektive vorhanden gewesen w re
533382 fakt ist auch dass bei uns auf der position hinten links ein gro er konkurrenzkampf herrscht und dar ber hinaus viele junge leute nachkommen von galatasaray gab es f r alle seiten ein reizvolles angebot dass sich f r uns finanziell sehr lukrativ gestaltete
533383 schlie lich habe ich hier eine sch ne zeit gehabt und mich sehr wohl gef hlt doch ich sehe bei galatasaray die bessere sportliche perspektive
533384 ein gro teil meiner familie lebt in istanbul so dass ich mich schnell zu hause f hlen werde
533385 wir h tten mit alparslan gerne weiter zusammengearbeitet und auch seinen vertrag verl ngert aber er hat den wunsch ge u ert zu wechseln diesem wunsch sind wir nachgekommen
533386 dieser wechsel zeigt erneut dass unsere ausgebildeten spieler immer auch interessant f r andere vereine sind
533387 das ist f r uns sowohl sportlich als auch menschlich ein gro er verlust aber ich kann verstehen dass galatasaray f r ihn eine gro e chance ist
533388 intensifying market conditions geographical challenges and communication cost have become some of the major drivers of ip telephony deployment within asia pacific
533389 both small and medium businesses smb and large businesses lb across verticals are resorting to the deployment of ip telephony to reduce communication cost and increase their workforce production
533390 businesses have now started to view the technology not only in terms of cost saving in communication but also from the standpoint of the strategic value it delivers to their operations
533391 ip telephony is not confined within the realm of communication alone but offers scope for integration with other software applications and hardware to achieve productive outcomes
533392 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
533393 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
533394 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
533395 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
533396 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
533397 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
533398 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
533399 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
533400 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
533401 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
533402 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
533403 people dont realize how much centrifugal force will pull you out toward the curb
533404 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
533405 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
533406 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
533407 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
533408 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
533409 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
533410 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
533411 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
533412 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
533413 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
533414 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
533415 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
533416 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
533417 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
533418 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
533419 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
533420 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
533421 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
533422 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
533423 finally on the subject of human rights it is certainly arguable that chinese claims in sic tibet are analogous to the uks to the falkland islands
533424 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
533425 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
533426 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
533427 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
533428 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
533429 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
533430 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
533431 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
533432 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
533433 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
533434 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
533435 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
533436 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
533437 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
533438 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
533439 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
533440 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
533441 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
533442 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
533443 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
533444 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
533445 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
533446 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

533448 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
533449 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
533450 work with the dncc to estimate the conventions carbon footprint
533451 it looks as though the population believes climate change is serious and there seems to be momentum behind the issue and there are some people who dont like that
533452 there are still plenty of creationists around and there are people who believe tobacco is not linked to serious health effects and so there are still people who choose to ignore or doubt the amount of evidence for climate change
533453 we would kill literally kill for a good paper that proved the science on global warming was wrong
533454 then i could retire and accept my chair at harvard unfortunately thats not going to happen and theres vast amounts of evidence why
533455 in essence the models we use to predict climate have been proven right

533459 watched our primary on the democratic side very carefully and they know that any accusation of racial divisiveness can be very very harmful for a candidates prospects
533460 had to respond quickly to make sure that nobody got the impression that they were engaged in those kind of racial politics
533461 may be going to his head and theyre trying to dwell on it
533462 we not address the issue of race in this country
533463 candidates who have a misstep in this area can really pay a heavy price
533464 i think were seeing an adverse reaction to the foreign trip
533465 the kind of thing that over the long haul has durable weaknesses in it
533466 is there an ego issue building or is it being blown out of proportion
533467 a touch of arrogance here hes very smart and he knows it
533468 little people that i met in rural pennsylvania who cling to their guns their faith and their zenophobia
533469 but clearly rolling up his sleeves and getting in the trenches seems to be working for him
533470 i think hes got to continue to act like hes rolling up his sleeves getting up early and working hard for the white house
533471 do think hes got to be careful about not assuming that he already is the president
533472 obama has filled some of that especially with his trip overseas but he obviously has to be careful about it
533473 who has made tough decisions like the surge which has made victory in iraq possible
533474 he has done neither of those things he has not provided leadership on any issue and he has not worked across party lines with republicans to achieve things
533475 an historic figure and his soaring rhetoric theres no there there

533482 i just hope i can build on it my first five outings it was hard to realize i was pitching in the big leagues today it was more of a feeling that it was just a baseball game it was the first time i felt like that
533483 we just felt like he wasnt making the progression that we thought he would and ultimately it came down to taking innings away from some guys who we feel need it
533484 we tried to be as patient as we could during this process and i can tell you he worked extremely hard to get back but in the end it just wasnt there
533485 it just was more or less kind of the overall picture we didnt think was going to help us get to where we wanted to be
533486 he was trending up at times but he never was able to sustain it

533494 we know where they iraqs wmds are theyre in the area around tikrit and baghdad and east west south and north somewhat
533495 it is unknowable how long that conflict war in iraq will last it could last six days six weeks i doubt six months
533496 we do know of certain knowledge that he osama bin laden is either in afghanistan or in some other country or dead
533497 osama bin laden is either alive and well or alive and not too well or not alive

533500 the truth is for reasons that have a lot to do with the u s government bureaucracy we settled on the one issue that everyone could agree on which was weapons of mass destruction as the core reason
533501 there are serving u s military officers today who are of the view that the first two identifiable causes of combat deaths in iraq are abu ghraib and guant namo

533522 it is extremely important to opera to be a part of the open iptv forum as we share common strategic goals lower the integration cost speed up time to market for iptv services and enable choice for consumers
533523 together we will create a solution based on open standards

533569 the game of chess is not merely an idle amusement several very valuable qualities of the mind useful in the course of human life are to be acquired and strengthened by it so as to become habits ready on all occasions for life is a kind of chess in which we have often points to gain and competitors or adversaries to contend with and in which there is a vast variety of good and ill events that are in some degree the effect of prudence or the want of it by playing at chess then we may learn 1st foresight which looks a little into futurity and considers the consequences that may attend an action 2nd circumspection which surveys the whole chess board or scene of action the relation of the several pieces and their situations 3rd caution not to make our moves too hastily

533577 the abyc courses were of great value to not only our member firms directly involved in the export market but also for those focusing on the local market
533578 if you comply with abyc there is a very good chance you will comply with ce
533579 abyc has conducted training courses in australia the united kingdom and canada and has also held training seminars through conferences throughout europe and asia
533580 if boat builders are interested in conducting business in the united states they recognize abyc as a leader in both standards development and education who can provide the necessary training

533582 it is a matter of delicate boat handling to keep the sail full
533583 we were alerted at 07h21 following reports of the vasco da gama yacht race yacht zeus reporting to be rudderless after sustaining damage to her rudder and requiring assistance 94 nautical miles north of richards bay and 30 nautical miles off shore
533584 the 8 crew on board reported to be in no imminent danger but requiring assistance
533585 our nsri rescue craft spirit of richards bay was launched and rendezvoused with zeus at approximately 15h30
533586 sea swells are an average 3 metres and nsri volunteers at our rescue base are monitoring the tow operations progress assisted by maritime radio services
533587 at 11h10 the vasco da gama yacht race yacht nina with 8 crew on board reported to have suffered a ripped mast 80 nautical miles north of richards bay and unable to sail further
533588 spirit of richards bay went past nina while still en route to rendezvous with zeus and confirmed that ninas crew were in no imminent danger motoring well towards richards bay port
533589 at present 22h00 01 08 2008 nina are approximately 30 nautical miles from richards bay and due in at port at around 06h00 to 07h00 tomorrow morning while spirit of richards bay towing zeus are approximately 40 nautical miles from port and making good headway

533591 you know the matrix is a difficult concept to pitch in the pitch i just didnt see it i watched keanus performance and very rarely do i say this but i would have messed it up i would have absolutely messed up the matrix at that point i wasnt smart enough as an actor to let the movie be whereas keanu was smart enough to just let it be let the movie and the director tell the story and dont try and perform every moment
533592 because he didnt think the plot would work and that playing a ghost would be detrimental to his career
533593 why else would she or katie holmes for that matter take on the thankless roll of rachel dawson after katie left the roll they couldve create a new character but that wasnt part of nolans plan this is the trajectory hes planned for rachel since the first movie not only is maggie contractually obligated but shes already getting in shape for batman 3
533594 obviously theres some of the long halloween in there theres some miller stuff
533595 it shows christopher nolan has imagination that he didnt cast me as the villain

533608 the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known
533609 the fact remains that there are far too many people becoming infected with hiv in the u s each year
533610 there is no national u s plan that includes not only prevention but also treatment and care
533611 we must recognize this epidemic as the crisis that it is and match our response
533612 the federal response to hiv prevention has unnecessarily endangered tens of thousands of americans
533613 with this new alarming estimate of hiv incidence it would be public health malpractice not to act immediately to drive new infections down there is no excuse to further delay refining and expanding evidence based hiv aids treatment and prevention programs

533627 overcomes the complexity high cost and yield and scalability limitations associated with vacuum based processes
533628 allows us to produce cells very inexpensively and assemble them into panels that are comparable in efficiency to that of high volume silicon based pv panels
533629 less than the depreciation expense that vacuum thin film companies have to pay for the equipment that produces their cells
533630 calculating a lifetime cost per kwh would require knowing how much sun will fall in exactly the spot where the panel will be
533631 a good part of this time the sun is shining at a large angle to the collector and in summer it will shine on the back of the collector some of the time early morning and late evening
533632 a lot of big tech firms are working on these technologies now so this is not going to slow down
533633 and it is more than likely that batteries will take just as big a leap into nanotech as solar panels
533634 to the extent that a house can be a net exporter of electricity to the grid then new centralised generation can be avoided altogether
533635 i assume it would be used the same way they use off peak power now in some places to pump the water back up into the dams for later usage

533640 in between each coat i sand i have to fill all the grain our finish is i think a lot better than what was done 100 years ago
533641 we have the technology to take a standing tree and turn it into a gunstock and if we need something bad enough i can go get it
533642 its a very short distance to our plant so its very convenient for us we buy sycamore lumber and he cuts it into the shape of a gunstock
533643 he has come up with some prototypes for some new models
533644 even though weve changed and were all finding our own place in the world we all know that when the tears fall or the smile spreads across our face well come to each other because no matter where this crazy world takes us nothing will ever change so much to the point where were not all still friends

533651 obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
533652 were not gonna allow racism to come into this campaign in any form
533653 and so im gonna respond if it comes up again
533654 i would hope that he would urge the speaker of the house to at least have a vote on it
533655 sen obama is still opposed to a comprehensive energy plan
533656 it seems to me the only thing he wants us to do is inflate tires
533657 you can believe me or you can believe your lying eyes rubes

533660 i think the discussions are moving ahead and i hope we have something resolved by monday i think weve gotten to the point where we kind of have to force it
533661 primarily it starts with whether brett favre wants to play football and then second whether the packers want him to play for them
533662 i was interjected into it because there was a tampering charge initially
533663 im not looking for things to interject myself to its an issue that needs to be addressed because of the competing interests you want to make sure its done properly and within our rules this is an issue that ultimately has to be decided between brett and the packers
533664 whats going on between brett and the organization is something that the players and coaches we cannot handle
533665 were not involved in it i think they did a good job from a responsibility standpoint dealing with it for about two days but the focus has been on improving
533666 today was our first bump in the road in terms of having too many negative things happen in practice and i think thats a credit to their focus and their energy level and staying true to its training camp
533667 everybody is going through it and theyve done a really good job no one is really talking about it frankly
533668 it was decided that the entire u s relay team will be disqualified from the sydney games
533669 it forms part of a wider piece of work on the balco case
533670 the clash between the rat and the horse is a serious clash between water and fire

533700 just a little observation i think you have unconsciously written something from the mind of god something people dont understand is that god is not merely an overseer a distant observer of the happenings of human beings he is the father of human beings the human feelings of a father towards a daughter or a son come from god but in fact in him are made perfect what that means is in pouring over your own fatherly emotions you get a glimpse of the perfect emotions in god he too feels exactly the way you have described for each and everyone one of his children that turn away from him because he will not force himself on anyone his hands are tied as well he suffers out of sadness as he waits for others to come around relying too on friends to plead his case so that his children find their way back home and all the while he knows it must unfold this way because as you so aptly noted it is somehow necessary for our survival people dont always comprehend this fact that god as father means he has fatherly emotions and just like us he too suffers emotionally for his children and perhaps in nearly the same exact manner in which you have described your own suffering

533833 of all the enemies to public liberty war is perhaps the most to be dreaded because it comprises and develops the germ of every other war is the parent of armies from these proceed debts and taxes and armies and debts and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few in war too the discretionary power of the executive is extended its influence in dealing out offices honors and emoluments is multiplied and all the means of seducing the minds are added to those of subduing the force of the people the same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes and the opportunities of fraud growing out of a state of war and in the degeneracy of manners and morals engendered by both no nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare

533846 there are plenty of good reasons for fighting but no good reason ever to hate without reservation to imagine that god almighty himself hates with you too wheres evil its that large part of every man that wants to hate without limit that wants to hate with god on its side its that part of every man that finds all kinds of ugliness so attractive its that part of an imbecile that punishes and vilifies and makes war gladly

533942 but when i went out on stage to get it and i saw the members of the orchestra standing and applauding i really started to lose it i was choking up and i thought youre not going to cry not now somehow i managed to keep it together but all my life ive wanted the respect of people like that and when i saw those musicians standing up i found it meant far more to me than i ever thought it would
533943 they were all there on the stage it was an amazing thing to hear

533963 this study sought to document the prevalence of sexual violence among school going males we found a marked difference between the provinces of south africa with the least economically developed province limpopo suffering the highest rates and the most developed area western cape the lowest
533964 the likely consequence of all this for south african society is the multiplication of sexual abuse since it is well established that people who have been sexually abused are more likely to become abusers themselves one in ten schoolboys who took part in the study admitted they had forced sex on someone else
533965 the rape of children calls for decisive investment in prevention reducing overall sexual violence will likely also pay dividends in reduction of hiv aids
533966 as it becomes more acceptable for male children to report sexual abuse we have to expect a massive increase in workload for help services like childline they will need support to meet this demand

533971 were going to measure the diameter of the tree how high the nest cavity is the species of the tree is it alive or is it dead so we can get some data on what seems to be the preferred habitat
533972 if our theory see this is all theory if our theory is correct the golf course replicates an oak savannah and there should be birds there
533973 the woodpecker is called a primary nester it digs the cavity but flying squirrels mice snakes bluebirds tree swallows there are lots of other animals that are secondary nesters

534107 you lose that opportunity to stand on top of the podium and feel the joy of winning the race those are the people who hurt the worst when there are cheaters ahead of them giving back the medals is just a technicality because you cant repair the hurt feelings and the hard work that went into it
534108 im not well versed in contemporary choreography but they invited me to their gala in new york that fall and twylas in the upper room was fresh in my mind when they asked me which choreographer id like to work with
534109 we hung out for an afternoon and said lets do it we got to know each other talking about narrative versus non narrative the pros and cons of each
534110 im not a moviegoer so i hadnt seen his work there
534111 he has a ton of energy he has a lot of range hes very versatile and he had his own rock n roll band who could not love that also he knows his film history and he knows his 20th century classical music history the russians in particular
534112 the music that inspired me in the first place was mostly composed for ballet
534113 i figured ill start and then go play music with twyla and see what she responds to
534114 the first time we hung out listening to a lot of records
534115 she happened to be listening to a scott joplin opera i thought ive never written a rag im going to write her a rag and i knew i was going to use a lot of percussion i wanted to end up with five movements i set myself certain parameters that every movement would borrow from each other i tried to create something where if i had the movements laid out if they were made of glass and i dropped them i would take fragments of each of them and mix them up so that each was borrowing bits from the other
534116 danny had a sense of structure that was symphonic also hes used to action to seeing and then reinforcing so he was ideal from the point of view of supporting action he was very focused a delight to work with he would always take the extra step sending you three versions instead of just two
534117 my only content was a very physical one the difference between a force directed against itself and another person and force directed together outward
534118 it investigated how all rhythm evolves from a single walking step and how any of the metric structures come from that shift of weight right and left
534119 i began to think about right and left to find a sort of duality in the body from that came this feeling of the opposition we all have inside ourselves how we have to work to coordinate that power thats the physical grounding for the scenario of rabbit and rogue those two characters evolved from that the ballet did not evolve in language
534120 even though the material had been shaped on other dancers i could make it my own in terms of the musicality and the intent the dynamic phrasing with this one we went further i spent two weeks mano a mano working with her in the studio in her apartment she gives you a very clear direction to go in but she also lets you play
534121 came through not in a literal or direct way but just atmospherically i start onstage by myself so i set the tone im not a dark force but maybe more mischievous i dont mind creating chaos along the way
534122 i would have done the process over and over again
534123 i cant speak highly enough about her she was just unbelievable to work with the communication the focus she had on us physically and mentally she just homed in on exactly what she wanted she could sense what was going to come out emotionally not just physically if you were frustrated shed like that shed say keep that feeling in there through her choreography the individual comes out
534124 her sense of geometry and symmetry and shaping dynamics in a way thats not what one would think in the broader sense it was so full of surprises
534125 there was a common understanding that education on online behavior needs to be strengthened

534130 i developed my music in the us because i had the chance to work with people over there but i always wanted to come back here and release it in new zealand i grew up here and i have family and friends here
534131 it was a direction i was seriously considering but eventually i realised it wasnt what i was looking for
534132 i felt like i had something i wanted to say and music i wanted to get out there and i thought i had to pursue it and give it a shot
534133 i wanted to change to something that was easier to remember easy for an audience to know
534134 im pleased with how our whole team did we came out here and competed really well
534135 all in all there were some good points the touchdown to keller was nice it showcased his abilities a little bit
534136 as im watching this game part of it is watching those guys but part of it is watching all the other new guys part of it is trying to look at the scheme and how those guys are executing the scheme theres a lot of new faces to look at thats really going to come more from the tape than this first look
534137 i just thought the group as a whole did what i was looking for them to do in terms of tempo and effort
534138 kellen put the ball right where it needed to be so there was no thinking or looking back after that
534139 im fine but im not at liberty to discuss injuries
534140 obviously the biggest reason they brought me here was to upgrade the pass rush so that is one of the things i have to get used to

534143 we havent changed the direction of the development were making the ps3 version first and then porting to the 360 later
534144 last week the community was rocked with rumors of a new psp that was reportedly under development
534145 tamron af 18 250mm f 3 5 6 3 xr di ii ld aspherical if
534146 la tamron me parece muy interesante por su versatilidad peso y dimensiones pero tiene una gran pega no dispone de estabilizador la sigma la encuentro bastante grande y pesada pero es os
534147 im really excited to work with a program as great as wisconsin
534148 i have a lot of fun ideas and i hope i can learn as much as i can help out
534149 one of the most satisfying things that has ever happened to me was that i made a relatively small vampire movie with a bunch of guys who never made a movie before and were true believers
534150 its their genre they are true enthusiasts for the genre and the script was a rocker
534151 you have to decide either be trampled under hamas shoes or stand in dignity
534152 we are sending a message that no one is above the law and that no family is above the law
534153 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
534154 by the way sometime in march im going to need to take a few weeks off cause my wife is having a baby
534155 i think they are the same person trying to get two paychecks
534156 a grand salon a throwback to new york of old
534157 ask the average guy if he knows or has heard of rubin chances are he has but not rattner
534158 i came up with one more energy related prediction the greatest self propelled vehicle ever invented the bicycle will experience a major renaissance
534159 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
534160 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
534161 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
534162 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
534163 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
534164 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
534165 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
534166 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
534167 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
534168 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
534169 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
534170 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
534171 is that a pistol in your pocket or are you happy to see me
534172 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
534173 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
534174 i lost the match but i was not happy with the situation why did they have to question every decision
534175 i come from italy and i am a gentleman i dont understand what permits them to say these bad words it is the first time in 15 years as a coach i have heard this
534176 i have nothing to apologise about and this shouldnt overshadow a good win we have had a coffee together in the office the manner of the victory was even sweeter after going a man down for 30 minutes and still coming back to get a second goal but we wont get carried away that is three points and its on to the next game
534177 irgendwie scheint alles leichter einfacher sch ner im sommer wenn es warm ist wenn die sonne scheint liegt das wirklich nur am wetter oder liegt es an uns an dem was wir machen an den perfekten tagen
534178 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
534179 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
534180 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
534181 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
534182 green homes are shining through as the bright spot in an otherwise gloomy housing market
534183 this twin crisis of peak oil and climate change is spurring innovation experimentation and excitement
534184 these big challenges are what the u s is best at frankly
534185 by providing guidelines and strategies in essence our job is to keep saying yes its possible heres how
534186 there are a zillion different codes and standards out there
534187 we want to make it much easier for people to adopt our goals
534188 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
534189 should we ignore gore or put him in charge hes an absurd extremist says mark davis the planet does not need saving the climate is not in crisis
534190 options fade for failing schools outside managers lack of interest in texas has forced campus closures
534191 until youve heard andy debate al gore you havent lived
534192 water pow front porch bands beliefs station conversation newteevee station
534193 someone told me the other day if i talked on my cell phone too much that i would get a brain tumor
534194 and ive also been told that if i drink diet drinks in a few years ill surely get cancer and i have to tell you i just dont believe that not because i like my cell phone and diet sodas but because i had the fortunate opportunity to speak with the kyle darras of the cancer center of bismarck and youd be surprised how many things are cancer safe
534195 those products emit low frequency radiation which cannot damage the dna of cells in the body
534196 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
534197 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
534198 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
534199 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
534200 for three decades ive heard speakers say things similar to what ive heard today thirty years ago they were called doomsdayers today we know enough to respect their opinions but we still havent changed our lifestyles i take good care of my clothes and they last a long time i have short cold showers and i dont own a car these solutions arent complex theyre right before every one of us
534201 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
534202 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
534203 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
534204 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
534205 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
534206 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
534207 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
534208 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
534209 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
534210 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
534211 you know gas prices are high when texans start driving golf carts
534212 part of a growing internet subculture with a fluid morality and a disdain for pretty much everyone else online
534213 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
534214 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
534215 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
534216 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
534217 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
534218 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
534219 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
534220 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
534221 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
534222 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
534223 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
534224 i had other priorities in the 60s than military service
534225 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
534226 the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
534227 thats a no brainer of course its a violation of international law thats why its a covert action the guy is a terrorist go grab his ass
534228 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
534229 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
534230 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
534231 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
534232 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
534233 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
534234 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
534235 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
534236 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
534237 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
534238 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
534239 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
534240 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
534241 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
534242 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
534243 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
534244 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
534245 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
534246 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
534247 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
534248 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
534249 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
534250 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
534251 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
534252 be it barisan or pakatan the only way to deal with this is to look after the peoples interest malaysians at large without stressing on ethnicity
534253 after the general election one should settle down and move on not plan to wrest power or change the government within three months by getting politicians to cross over
534254 it has no relation to power struggle or who wants to be president of a political party but rather with the fear and anxiety of politicians in the ruling party they are fearful that they may lose power at any time they are no longer confident that they will have power for another 50 years
534255 i told them i was appalled by such a statement we are talking about taxpayers dollars that must be treated with as much transparency and openness as possible and spent with as much due diligence as possible to assure the best return on those tax dollars
534256 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
534257 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
534258 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
534259 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
534260 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
534261 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
534262 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
534263 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
534264 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
534265 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
534266 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
534267 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
534268 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
534269 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
534270 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
534271 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
534272 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
534273 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
534274 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
534275 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
534276 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
534277 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
534278 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
534279 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
534280 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
534281 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
534282 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
534283 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
534284 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
534285 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
534286 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
534287 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
534288 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
534289 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
534290 if youre to take a normal spring training progression youre looking at four or five starts to get him comfortably up to 90 pitches in hopefully six innings
534291 threw 50 pitches we also incorporated almost a simulated inning where he sat five six minutes before throwing his last 15 pitches he responded well to that weve got to build up the endurance in the back and in the overall conditioning and get him back to game speed
534292 what happened in anaheim was he threw out of the bullpen and really felt good he got in a game at game speed with adrenaline and he could feel it we need to guard against that this time we just want to make sure hes ok get him down there tomorrow and pitch him and see how that goes
534293 not everybody here has to go play every single day
534294 i can play him in the outfield here and there i can play him at second and third
534295 he is gonna be an extra guy with a lot of action if you want to call it that way
534296 im not concerned about where i play or when i play whenever i play i just do what i can do to help the team win i cant get caught up in all that other stuff thats out of my control
534297 i think im playing pretty good right now and obviously theres nowhere for me to play i know that they know that actas going to try to get me at bats and hopefully he can squeeze me in there somewhere and hopefully i can continue to do well
534298 weve got 23 year olds up here they need to play they deserve to play theyve got an opportunity to show the guys what they can do and this is their chance to shine so let those kids go out there and shine
534299 so ive got to find a way to get it right
534300 it wont affect me because ill continue to be as aggressive as i am
534301 i feel like im doing things right its just timing wise i feel like im off
534302 with the factor of having to option randy flores and option kelvin jimenez we just really started to run out of spots and it became a numbers game
534303 ultimately we felt it was time to cut our ties with him i can tell you he worked very hard to get to where he was and it is disappointing that it didnt work out
534304 at the end of the day we didnt feel he was going to be able to contribute to our major league team
534305 hes had a tough go theres no doubt about it getting to know him a little over the spring really a nice young man and i wish him the best but as we all know we have tough decisions to make in this game and this is one we felt like we had to address
534306 i can walk fine but pushing off of it is hard its hard to take that first big step
534307 after wednesday we said well well give him 48 hours and he should be ready to go yesterday i had him in there he came out and tried it and said no go
534308 youre talking about a young player who is trying to feel his way through a little bit
534309 its a little bit of learning to play through some of that pain
534310 i actually talked with him on friday and just said the way blevins is throwing and ziegler is throwing i could potentially use anybody in any situation right now if i see a spot that might help us win a game in the seventh or eighth inning i could use him
534311 if its a save situation i could still use street
534312 im not making any drastic change other than saying that anybody down there could be asked to throw at any time i didnt want to make a blanket statement youre not my closer because he could still close games
534313 its been a tough week as far as dealing with the pain
534314 im kind of excited just to get that taken care of after meeting with the doctor and everything i feel really confident that i should have a 100 percent recovery
534315 it had been bothering me and then it just got real bad to the point where it was intolerable
534316 i dont think any doubt that in 06 and 07 hes a healthy winning productive player
534317 its reasonable to say that between the hernia and this its amazing hes been able to do anything his toughness is off the chart
534318 i felt it cramp a little bit my last at bat
534319 usually they say im ok and you give them a couple of days more
534320 he can get treatment and hopefully well see how he is early in the week if not we have to make a decision i hate to waste that dl time
534321 right now the plan is to take it day to day and just be careful with it hopefully as we go on it will get better the hamstring is probably the toughest injury to gauge and to have just when you feel good you may have a little tweak here and there you have to try and stay on top of it as best you can
534322 i just wanted to test it one more time to convince myself thats what needs to get done
534323 you have to have a lot of patience i think ill be able to do it
534324 im confident that everything will come back better than it was
534325 ive never missed a game in professional baseball because of an arm issue its definitely unexpected to say the least its all new to me
534326 my daughter whos a democrat and i had an agreement that we would never talk about politics
534327 this past year i registered as uncommitted or independent just so i could vote for barack obama in the primary
534328 at no time since fdr led us out of the depression and not since then has our country faced such a damaging prospect
534329 my mother who is 89 gave birth to me as a republican
534330 we need to work on it theres no question about it
534331 we need to work on him being a little quicker to the plate and holding the runners but again hes learning some stuff and thats what i was talking about maybe picking it up for the next start
534332 guys like taveras jose reyes and luis castillo those guys are going to steal bases
534333 its those middle speed guys that we need to hold on
534334 theres a fine line between hurrying him up and putting pressure on his arm
534335 hes learning how to hold runners field his position and minimize damage pitching around guys holding them on
534336 all that comes with experience and maturity hes a very very smart kid he just needs to make some adjustments
534337 its a great organization and i cant say enough about them giving me an opportunity like this
534338 talking to nick evans he said itll probably hit me when im out in left field and i see 40 000 people around me
534339 but its been something i could deal with i was just trying to make the best of it
534340 especially right now in this heat we need to give guys a rest
534341 hes fallen into some traps in the past where hes come up from the minors and tried to accomplish a lot in a short period of time and became pull happy
534342 hes got some barrel to his bat but youre going to see that with more regularity of play what weve stressed to him is looking for a ball thats on if its away go ahead and bang it the other way and they might revisit the situation and come inside where he can turn and burn a ball
534343 its baseball its a business theres more to this than just a game its more than just throwing the ball
534344 it was hard it was not the way i wanted to go
534345 i went five or six days without pitching and it affected me a little bit but if i would have thrown a better pitch to gary sheffield on wednesday i would have gotten out of the inning
534346 i threw the pitch where it wasnt supposed to be
534347 i also feel better physically than i felt early in the year maybe because ive been used more times and im throwing more pitches more consistently
534348 the tips they gave me about my mechanics when i first got to cleveland are paying off
534349 rincons velocity is back and he has that out breaking ball a hard slider thats his out pitch hes still trying to clean up his delivery still trying to be more consistent with his release point
534350 im impressed with his stuff i think once he reels it in a little bit we might have something
534351 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
534352 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
534353 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
534354 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
534355 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
534356 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
534357 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
534358 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
534359 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
534360 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
534361 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
534362 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
534363 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
534364 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
534365 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
534366 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
534367 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
534368 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
534369 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
534370 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
534371 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
534372 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
534373 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
534374 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
534375 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
534376 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
534377 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
534378 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
534379 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
534380 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
534381 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
534382 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
534383 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
534384 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
534385 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
534386 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
534387 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
534388 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
534389 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
534390 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
534391 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
534392 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
534393 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
534394 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
534395 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
534396 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
534397 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
534398 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
534399 but i resent when you throw out stupid allegations that have no merit and really no purpose other than to inflame
534400 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father rom 8 23 and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body rom 9 4 who are israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises gal 4 5 to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons eph 1 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will

534403 you have a talent for leadership bob the country needs young men like you in the leadership of the nation
534404 after about a year i became disinterested quit paying my dues and dropped my membership in the organization during the nine years that have followed i have never been interested in the klan

534409 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
534410 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
534411 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
534412 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
534413 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge
534414 are you a sports fan do you know any sports player who gives up
534415 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
534416 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
534417 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
534418 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
534419 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
534420 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
534421 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
534422 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
534423 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
534424 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
534425 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
534426 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
534427 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
534428 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
534429 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
534430 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
534431 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
534432 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
534433 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
534434 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
534435 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
534436 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
534437 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
534438 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
534439 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
534440 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
534441 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
534442 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
534443 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
534444 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
534445 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
534446 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
534447 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
534448 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
534449 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
534450 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
534451 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
534452 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
534453 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
534454 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
534455 when holtz came in we were sick and tired of losing
534456 youre seeing more and more teams go to that system
534457 the two quarterbacks different strengths one with his feet one with his arms give the defense a lot more to prepare for
534458 we wanted to go to a bowl game and we did that then we wanted to win a bowl game and we did that we want to win the division
534459 por su difusor de angeli se esta convirtiendo en la norma para alguna gente
534460 ms m you know how when you are talking to one of your friends you call them other names well today i called d a nigga so i just wanted to say to him and the class that it meant my boy my friend and this is not an issue for you all to go tell your parents its not a big deal
534461 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
534462 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
534463 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
534464 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
534465 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
534466 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
534467 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
534468 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
534469 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
534470 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
534471 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
534472 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
534473 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
534474 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
534475 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
534476 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
534477 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
534478 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
534479 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
534480 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
534481 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
534482 if the vice president says its do able i believe
534483 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
534484 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
534485 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
534486 nos repugna que de juana est en la calle pero creemos en la ley
534487 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
534488 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
534489 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
534490 russell mesler is a lawrence resident and an emeritus professor in kansas universitys department of chemical and petroleum engineering
534491 bozo your ad hominem comment directed against professor mesler is not only out of line
534492 were spending 1 trillion a year on the war department
534493 where does uranium fuel come from canada australia the former soviet union and africa the last time i checked how does this make us less reliant on foreign sources how long is the uranium supply supposed to last at current consumption 50 years
534494 did none of you read that even at 100 utilization of wind energy in kansas is is 384 mwatts
534495 misinformation is wrong or inaccurate information it is distinguished from disinformation by motive misinformation is simply erroneous while disinformation in contrast is intended to mislead
534496 i guess we can understand why mr mesler has a vested interest in supplying this bit of disinformation
534497 please explain what ive read is the true 100 utilization of wind energy would meet all of kansass energy needs with plenty left for export
534498 offset and with all the availble energy you can only offset 20
534499 wind energy only and the countries with wind energy are using it to
534500 asbestos and the columnist talked about the subsidies that wind gets
534501 they just got 10 billion taxpayer dollars in the energy policy act of 2005 to jumpstart the moribund industry and utilities were given until the end of 2008 to sign up for a new nuke and qualify for the huge taxbreaks cost sharing and risk insurance protection in the package
534502 sorry dude but that was the point of the article there is only 386
534503 1 3 wind turbines will not produce power efficiently below a wind speed of 15mph they must be disengaged at wind speeds over 50mph to prevent damage to the turbine they also require a fairly demanding amount of maintenance
534504 wind and pv systems should be installed in every house in the united states for those people that want to participate to offset their energy bill
534505 short term threat to the growth of wind energy is the looming expiration of federal tax credits at the end of this year but the wind industry should not ask for more government support it should be made to stand on its own
534506 have you conducted an energy audit on your system capital operational maintenance revenue all in joules if your system doesnt produce more energy than it took to make maintain operate and dispose then dont bother
534507 asbestos i stand by my talking about per capita energy consumption and california per capita consumption has stayed flat for the past 30 years look it up
534508 as a taxpayer this is a poor use of my monies and i might add it a poor use of my monies collected by utilities as a ratepayer
534509 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
534510 wind energy away pretty clear that the author was correct and he was stating in the 300
534511 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
534512 that means that the state has 235 gigawatts of wind energy potential 1 gigawatt is 1000 megawatts look it up
534513 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
534514 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
534515 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
534516 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
534517 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
534518 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
534519 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
534520 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
534521 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
534522 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
534523 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does
534524 i hope the eagles now can win it the sixers mo cheeks and those guys can win it
534525 its amazing how many people have texted or e mailed or called
534526 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
534527 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
534528 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
534529 its appalling to me that the tea wants to suspend the board when we have been instrumental in returning this district to a higher academic status
534530 it appears to me that tea wants the district to fail by stopping the progress of the board
534531 tea decided to some in im so glad they decided to come in
534532 we need somebody to manage it to get it back on track and get it in the direction it should be
534533 tea came in here they put an uncertified superintendent in place
534534 they used that superintendent after they finished with the superintendant then they got rid of him they did not allow the board to hire a certified superintendent thats what we need

534542 everybody is descended from space aliens except for the black race

534590 you cant teach people to have a great personality or to be nice
534591 its not that the customer is always right you should just let him think he is
534592 i saw things as a chain and felt that everything
534593 man can never know the kind of loneliness a woman knows man lies in a womans womb only to gather strength he nourishes himself from this fusion and then he rises and goes into the world into his work into battle into art he is not lonely he is busy the memory of the swim in amniotic fluid gives him energy completion the woman may be busy too but she feels empty sensuality for her is not only a wave of pleasure in which he has bathed and a charge of electric joy at contact with another when man lies in her womb she is fulfilled each act of love is a taking of man within her and act of birth and rebirth of child bearing and man bearing man lies in her womb and is reborn each time anew with a desire to act to be but for a woman the climax is not in the birth but in the moment when man rests inside of her
534594 i love your silences they are like mine you are the only being before whom i am not distressed by my own silences you have a vehement silence one feels it is charged with essences it is a strangely alive silence like a trap open over a well from which one can hear the secret murmur of the earth itself

534601 im a man of logic and facts but if you say the words animal and cruelty in the same sentence to me im just gonna go out and kill a thousand more
534602 i know that speaking in tongues is for today because i have spoken in tongues
534603 i know that speaking in tongues is valid because i know someone who speaks in tongues
534604 i know that god has special healers today because my best friend was healed by one of them
534605 have you had the baptism of the spirit the charismatic experience of speaking in tongues etc
534606 what know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which who is in you which ye have of from god and ye are not your own
534607 how do i know that the holy spirit dwells within me charismatic renewal offers an answer to this question the baptism of the holy spirit a powerful experience that convinces the recipient that god is real
534608 i know that it is true because i have experienced it i have felt it it has happened to me
534609 but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his
534610 and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is past tense
534611 the simple preaching of christ and the cross is not enough simple salvation in christ is not enough there is more that you need you need to have the pentecostal experience of speaking in tongues etc
534612 he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things
534613 could you tell me one thing that i need as a believer that is not found in jesus christ can you think of one thing that i really need that i do not already have in christ
534614 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ
534615 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law
534616 for this is the will of god even your sanctification holiness same word as in verse 7 that ye should abstain from fornication for god hath not called us unto uncleanness but unto holiness he therefore that despiseth despiseth not man but god who hath also given unto us his holy spirit
534617 let those who name the name of christ depart from iniquity
534618 and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption
534619 the person who is living sinfully who knows he is living sinfully who enjoys living in such a manner who intends to continue that sinful way of living that person does not have the holy spirit living within him the very fact that he is comfortable about his sin is proof of the spirits absence
534620 i have spoken in tongues i have had this experience
534621 and be not drunk with wine wherein is excess but be filled with the spirit speaking to yourselves in strange ecstatic utterances
534622 charismatics see their tongues as god given prayer language perhaps angelic but to those who would only ever address god intelligibly and who know from professional linguistic scholars who are unanimous on this that glossolalia has no language character at all
534623 william samarin professor of linguistics at the university of toronto wrote
534624 now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language and how hear we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born acts 2 6 8
534625 because every man heard them speak in his own language
534626 and they were all amazed and marveled saying one to another behold are not all these which speak galilaeans
534627 yet in the church i had rather speak five words with my understanding that by my voice i might teach others also than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue
534628 determine not to speak a word of english at this time for you cannot speak two languages at once lift up the sound of your voice and the holy spirit will give you utterance in a new language supernaturally do not be concerned about what to say as the language is spoken supernaturally and does not come through the mind or intellect but through your spirit quickened by the holy spirit in faith put your speech faculties into operation vocal chords tongue lips as in speaking any language and the holy spirit now indwelling you will give the utterance
534629 marcus open thy mouth speak whatsoever occurs to thee she then vainly puffed up and elated by these words and greatly excited in soul by the expectation that it is herself who is to prophesy her heart beating violently from emotion reaches the requisite pitch of audacity and idly as well as impudently utters some nonsense as it happens to occur to her such as might be expected from one healed by an empty spirit
534630 i thank my god i speak with tongues more than ye all yet in the church i had rather speak five words with my understanding that by my voice i might teach others also than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue
534631 and god hath set some in the church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers after that miracles then gifts of healings helps governments diversities of tongues
534632 the ability to understand and to engage in the exposition of the word of god
534633 the gift of prophecy was actually the ability to proclaim gods word the gift of prophecy then is the ability to speak before people to proclaim gods word sometimes with a predictive element
534634 and thou shalt speak unto him and put words in his mouth and i will be with thy mouth and with his mouth and will teach you what ye shall do and he shall be thy spokesman unto the people and he shall be even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth and thou shalt be to him instead of god
534635 and the lord said unto moses see i have made thee a god to pharaoh and aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet thou shalt speak all that i command thee and aaron thy brother shall speak unto pharaoh that he send the children of israel out of his land
534636 for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost
534637 now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet saying
534638 no the church doesnt need new revelation from heaven today we already have a completed bible and the holy spirit of god to interpret and apply it what the church needs is a new confrontation with the whole counsel of god proclaimed in the power of the holy spirit with authority and love by men who know their god and who honor his only written revelation then and then only may we expect our deepest needs to be supplied and gods purpose for his church to be accomplished in our day
534639 and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief corner stone
534640 but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privily shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the lord that bought them and bring upon themselves swift destruction
534641 i personally cannot find any biblical justification for saying the gift of tongues was meant exclusively for new testament times
534642 i believe there is a genuine gift of tongues which god is giving today
534643 ridiculously extreme position that denies the gift of tongues altogether
534644 the gift of tongues is no longer available to the church
534645 speaking in tongues and the working of sign miracles gradually ceased as the new testament scriptures were completed and their authority established
534646 charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away
534647 evidence for the appearance of glossolalia at least from the late second century to the eighteenth or nineteenth century is scarce and frequently obscure origen in the third century and chrysostom in the fourth both disparaged the accounts of speaking in tongues and rejected its continued validity augustine early in the fifth century asserted that glossolalia was a sign adapted only to biblical times
534648 this whole place is very obscure commenting on the references to tongues in 1 corinthians but the obscurity is produced by our ignorance of the facts referred to and by their cessation being such as then used to occur but now no longer take place
534649 it is significant that the gift of tongues is nowhere alluded to hinted at or even found in any writings of the post apostolic fathers
534650 montanus in his unbridled ambition to reach the top laid himself open to the adversary was filled with spiritual excitement and suddenly fell into a kind of trance and unnatural ecstasy he raved and began to chatter and talk nonsense prophesying in a way that conflicted with the practice of the church handed down generation by generation from the beginning of those who listened at that time to his sham utterances some were annoyed regarding him as possessed a demoniac in the grip of a spirit of error a disturber of the masses they rebuked him and tried to stop his chatter remembering the distinction drawn by the lord and his warning to guard vigilantly against the coming of false prophets then he secretly stirred up and inflamed minds closed to the true faith raising up in this way two others women whom he filled with the sham spirit so that they chattered crazily inopportunely and wildly like montanus himself
534651 marcus to a woman receive first from me and by me the gift of charis woman i have never at any time prophesied nor do i know how to prophesy marcus open thy mouth speak whatsoever occurs to thee and thou shalt prophesy she then vainly puffed up and elated by these words and greatly excited in soul by the expectation that it is herself who is to prophesy her heart beating violently from emotion reaches the requisite pitch of audacity and idly as well as impudently utters some nonsense as it happens to occur to her such as might be expected from one healed by an empty spirit
534652 it is said that in order to mortify the flesh she instituted the practice of men and women dancing together naked while they spoke in tongues
534653 right from the beginning with joseph smith mormons have accepted tongues as a valid gift for modern times when their temple was dedicated in salt lake city hundreds of elders spoke in tongues
534654 today shamans witch doctors priests or medicine men in haiti greenland micronesia and countries of africa australia asia and north and south america speak in tongues several groups use drugs to aid in inducing the ecstatic state and utterances voodoo practitioners speak in tongues buddhist and shinto priests have been heard speaking in tongues moslems have spoken in tongues and an ancient tradition even reports that mohammed himself spoke in tongues
534655 the baptism in the holy spirit is a definite personal experience subsequent to salvation and confirmed to the believer with the evidence of speaking in a new language or tongue supernaturally as the holy spirit gives utterance
534656 the baptism of the holy spirit as a separate distinct experience subsequent to salvation providing enduement of power for life and service accompanied by speaking in tongues
534657 for by one spirit are were past tense we all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit
534658 the tarrying procedure for seeking tongues goes like this following the sermon the preacher invites those who want the tongues experience to come to the altar and kneel
534659 and behold i send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high
534660 and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait tarry same word as in luke 24 49 for the promise of the father which saith he ye have heard of me
534661 but when the comforter is come whom i will send unto you from the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me
534662 he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you
534663 but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed are constantly being changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord

534683 the economic crash of this country is soon to come inflation is growing rapidly like a fungus and the value of the dollar continues to fall the copper that penny is made from is worth a hundred times more than that federal reserve note you carry in your purse or wallet the value of a persons home savings account cd or any other material thing such as an automobile is losing value fast the only way to be assured that you have anything of value when the depression hits is by making sure you have plenty of precious metals on hand take those dollars and purchase silver or gold with them for the simple reason thats the only thing that will be of value when the economy crashes save them somewhere safe which is not in a bank when the banks start closing down you will not have access to your safe deposit box the depresssion that will take place will be far worse than the great depression so many have read about in history books when the economy collapses the stock market comes crashing down you can rest assured that two thing will take place there will be massive civil unrest among the citizens and martial law will be declared my first thought would be how can martial law be declared and work successfully when seventy five percent of our military troops are across the ocean somewhere the majority of them are stationed in other countries protecting their borders remember your taxes are paying for troops stationed at 700 military bases in 140 other countries around the world they will use troops from that military contracter many of us have come to know the name of

534722 rick tomlinsons voice of the seven woods is cutting a quiet path into lone acoustic guitar workouts tomlinson plucks away folkily like a sedate jack rose putting the listener in a swoon for the duration of its twenty minutes finishing with a trail of tiny wavering feedback notes this piece wanders along the scales without getting lost up its own behind as ever the first person labels packaging is superb the delicate paper cut silhouette of a woodland scene is as beautiful as the music

534724 i hate being raped every day every day that i live i am raped everybody rapes me every day do you know what its like to be raped every day
534725 portlands tone wrangler aaron davis aka acre has been blasting the world with his massive but barely there feedback swells for quite some time with releases on black horizons jk and more his first lp offering brings about the acre essence quite well massive walls of shoe gazed feedback are some how tamed into smooth quintessential drones this is not the sound of synthesizers or keyboards but a single tone being modified and replicated into a monolithic piece stasis so strong it is hard to realize the power of these two side long tracks until they end forcing silence back upon the listener direct hypnosis and transcendental zoning in an edition of 200 records in pro printed fold over sleeves

534730 the end of the firstperson label comes in the form of the third release for fp from phil todds psychedelic behemoth ensemble two tracks of shortwave static low end rumble and searing guitar pyrotechnics from possibly the most consistently on form artist the uk underground has produced it is fitting that the last release should come from todd whose betley welcomes careful drivers imprint and rigid commitment to a sustained and formidable work ethic formed an early and undeniable influence
534731 this live trio release under the steadily hazed out helm of phil todd sees melanie delaney and phil legard hitch a lift with the ashtray navigations brand in the centre of this twenty minute rip is a guitar part that is trying to avoid slipping down the cracks of its imposed mutant buckling a fiery jazz rock heart glows white hot in a rising hiss of radio abuse bursts of yellow noise and sounds full of eastern promise from the seventies eventually todd finds a foothold and hoists himself onto his metaphorical cairn sending out six string bagpipe vibes through air as thick as space cake these passages of euphoric storm make it all the more difficult to understand why he chose such a thoroughly unpleasant word as ashtray for this project
534732 now into his 12th year operating under the ashtray navigations moniker amp with releases on such esteemed labels as menlo park jewelled antler siltbreeze american tapes celebrate psi phenomenon etc phil todd continues to conjure up his own unique brand of rural psychedelic folk musik

534750 though dead raven choir manoeuvres here within the more restrained corners of the bm spectrum the spirit that pervades selenoclast wolves is undeniably black this long awaited album from the enigmatic ethereal conjurer smolken comprises six brand new odes as well as the entire nine track lesbian corpse wolves album reworked as a generous bonus the latter was originally released on cdr in 2003 limited to a mere 30 copies so all 15 tracks hereon will represent a new experience to most listeners for those who don t know the individual behind drc smolken is a schizoid performer alternating between raw black metal and avant garde neo folk selenoclast wolves focuses on the latter facet of his muse with lyrics borrowed from a host of eclectic poets including pugilist and ear biter extraordinaire mike tyson i am not a recluse you should know already that you are in the realm of the truly bizarre residing once more in his native poland after spending some time in texas smolken is one of the underground s most prolific creators he allegedly recorded about ten albums in the four years leading up to 2004 all of which had the word wolves included somewhere in the title and most of which were available only on cdr that mainstay of non commerciality drc also released a triple vinyl retrospective collection of its entire black metal catalogue last year but this vanished quicker than a condom in a whorehouse eerier than mick jagger s pulling power and creepier than a paedophile s smile the ghostly rumblings of selenoclast wolves are designed to fuck with your mind deceptively accessible this is nonetheless as unique a dosage of extreme dementia as you could wish to encounter the promotional jargon stresses folk influences and the presence of acoustic guitars bass fiddle troll cittern cello banjo mandolin and piano as well as many spoken passages and the overall earthy vibe backs this up emphatically but another accurate description of drc s bewitching output as evidenced here might be unplugged black or acoustic black it s i refer generally to the first six songs definitely got the cold dirty heart of black metal but without any emphasis on electrics pounding percussion or aggression leading to a bizarre mix of pagan tunes laid back sensibilities and naked angst delightfully understated and carefree opening shots the silence and january work subtly at the emotions setting a surreal tone that magnifies and amplifies the further we venture into the myriad chambers of smolken s mind though the waters are calm a sense of menace lurks close to the surface not unlike the movie deliverance and there is a foreboding feeling that all is genuinely not well closer to nick cave than darkthrone selenoclast wolves possesses a seedy slimy underbelly that erupts during the disturbing tyson inspired rant that ends the first movement of this release like iron mike in his physical prime this one will lay you out cold there s a clear change of tact for the nine bonus tracks which are even more subdued with abundant female vocals some of these songs remind me of pj harvey or bjork perhaps antimatter or the gathering even there are also strong hints of william blake era ulver perceptible in both male and female deliveries as the pace drops close to that of a snails funeral a multifaceted volume shows its two faces that s smolken for you quite the trickster

534773 in 1996 in santiago de chile some friends started jamming at diegos one of the members of the group workshop as a way of doing music by non musicians absolutely free with any goals in mind like releasing music and even forming a band they just recorded these jams a pile of cassettes in an old four tracks tape recorder in the early 2000s la bandas were reduced to members diego salm n and jm they did their first concert at an independent festival hosted by hoffmanss house art gallery in 2006 lvaro joined the group that met the duo the cindy sisters with whom they played several sessions and now also belong to la bandas a seven piece band nowadays but i would say that there is an occasional member who is soul support for the group mr hugo ch vez a well known music fan and promoter of underground chilean bands this chilean psychedelic improv collective just released their first self titled album on the pastabase label based in santiago and new york la bandas album consists in seven tracks that combine psychedelia noise and folk the sound is dirty and with the hiss of a cassette and taken just as it came out of the tape recorder the first song which is recorded in backwards recalls the sound of sonic boom deep and hypnothic it is the only track of the album that has a more electronic sound on la bandas there is a permanent clatter percussion melodic keyboards guitar and analogue synthesizer alongside some voices in the background as well a real improv session with no direction of whats coming next the tracks are unpredictable and evolves to a fresh sound that this band unfolds

534792 surfings lost chapter how did daytona beach become floridas 1st surf city
534793 people didnt know what a surfboard was and for years they didnt know what we were doing
534794 some of the lifeguards were out there fooling around on these boards
534795 surfing had totally disappeared throughout the islands except for a few isolated spots and even there only a handful of men took boards into the sea
534796 we worked every minute so we could leave on the weekend and go to daytona and surf
534797 we actually surfed at daytona probably one of the first times was after the 1934 hurricane we carried our surfboards on a trailer and camped on the beach
534798 i remember seeing dudley driving into town in a fancy convertible with surfboards towed behind it
534799 my brother and i decided to build boards like them
534800 i once mounted a 1 1 2 horsepower water witch outboard on that board
534801 they were very much faster for paddling slow to get started of course but probably faster than you could paddle a canoe once you got going and you could catch big waves much farther out
534802 during the hurricane season you could catch some pretty good sized ones maybe 7 8 9 foot waves that were breaking out there beyond the pier
534803 youd have to really walk the board youd catch the wave and youd have to walk about four or five feet to keep the nose down and then walk it back and forth to keep it going
534804 you had to lean over with your hand to steer it
534805 we were just kids and we showed it to duke
534806 but he didnt really have time for a couple of haole hawaiian slang for mainland outsiders boys so we went ahead and unwrapped our surfboards people gathered around to watch us unpack and when the hawaiians saw our surfboards they gave us surf racks of honor
534807 doerr went into the air force and he was a fighter pilot and got shot down and was in a german prison camp for a couple of years
534808 brewster and i were in front of the boardwalk and we came in after dark because the waves were so good and we were reported to the police that two men had come in on torpedoes
534809 right around 1940 the trail goes dead it doesnt start back up again until the 1950s
534810 i kind of hate to admit it being from cocoa beach where we call ourselves the east coast surfing capitol
534811 but the first seeds were planted in the daytona beach area
534812 but by 69 everybody at seabreeze had a surfboard or damn near
534813 in fact we had it out in the ocean one day and it sank we lost it
534814 my brother dana used to anchor a sailboat out off of daytona plaza we had pretty big boards back then too and my brother and his friends would each put a case of beer and a beach bunny on their board and paddle out to the sailboat for an evening of revelry
534815 i came home from gainesville because i knew it was going to be good and i surfed in front of the old voyager hotel
534816 you couldnt lose your board because it would smack into the sea wall there was no beach wed never seen waves like that it was so big 10 or 12 foot waves
534817 and the next thing we see is their heads from the back of the waves screaming right and left and then they would do a kick out and the board would come flying back out of the wave
534818 we were just sitting there dumbfounded we thought youd be killed if you tried to surf in the shallow water in big wave shore pound
534819 we also built belly boards that were about 4 feet long and 2 feet wide by putting thin boards together and crossing them with two small boards and rounding the nose they were only good for catching a breaking wave and riding the foam in
534820 there was nobody from new smyrna surfing and i dont recall anybody from cocoa either
534821 hart was in the same fraternity we were in in gainesville
534822 we used to stay with him his mother had the drug store on main street he built his own surfboard
534823 the kid on the far left is a boy named wilbur flowers
534824 all the billions of christ followers over the last two thousand years have this in common a spiritual gift is given to each of us 1 cor 12 7 gods body has no nobodies no exceptions no exclusions
534825 to think just five years ago there were no twisty tracks on the schedule now we may see the oval majority go away by 2010 its one thing to undergo an evolution its another to go about it in a bad fashion and i think the irl is definitely going about their evolution in a bad fashion
534826 it has been a challenge but a wonderful one to have because of the number of venues that are capable of hosting our races
534827 when unification was announced earlier this year we talked about the opportunity of developing future schedules on a blank piece of paper and with todays announcement we have a solid foundation for developing a consistent long term schedule for the indycar series
534828 looking ahead to 2009 and with one season of unification under our belts we know that the indycar series continues to offer the most diverse schedule in all of motorsports
534829 as our schedule has evolved in the past few years the race for the indycar series championship has become one that demands the ability of both drivers and teams to master a variety of venues and the challenges each one brings with the end result being a true champion
534830 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
534831 fuel prices have doubled in the past year a successful hedging programme mitigated the impact but nevertheless fuel costs at 706 million were up 233 million in the quarter we expect our fuel bill to top 3 billion this year the equivalent of more than 8 million every day

534837 in a way seeing the four women in sex and the city and how the story of their lives has moved on reminded me of the spice girls and how weve moved on the spice girls reunion tour was a very healing experience for me it put to bed every bit of doubt guilt insecurity i had about leaving the girls when i did i felt id made amends with them come away with a sense of completion about that chapter in my life
534838 it was a little difficult at first but we were cool with it
534839 kevin moved on and so have we were comfortable with what we do as four and its still just as strong competitive spirit thats just in every single one of us and to be the best that we can be as a team as a group and musically we feel that what we stand for is honesty and purity in great music that people love

535093 we do not want a summer of leadership speculation we have got a good case to make and we should get out there and make it all this leadership speculation gets in the way of us putting our message across

535098 there is a need to create a task force composed of different government agencies which will be tasked to put forward to the senate the benefits advantages and opportunities to the philippine economy of a bilateral agreement with japan
535099 the task force will create a better presentation for the senators why did i say better because the senate has conducted two hearings on the jpepa and apparently the senators are not yet convinced that the deal entails net benefit for the country that is why the president has created this task force to focus on the ratification of jpepa
535100 what has been in the mind set of senators is the supposed dumping of toxic wastes in the country they must show that the deal has a lot of benefits like better opportunities for filipino workers and investments i think they should point out there are a lot of advantages

535200 sobre la soluci n de los verdaderos problemas de la gente como inflaci n inseguridad y la energ a no emite palabra
535201 me llam poderosamente la atenci n que nadie preguntara o que la presidenta omitiera hablar sobre el acto en la rural no se hizo una sola menci n al discurso de luciano miguens que fue contundente y que merec a al menos una menci n o consulta sobre que opinaba la presidenta
535202 creo que la conferencia la arm la presidenta para arrebatarle la tapa de los diarios al campo no fue seria no tuvo definiciones y es grave que haya ratificado que no va a haber cambios en su gabinete y en su pol tica de gobierno
535203 su actitud arrogante no es propia de un cuadro pol tico sino de alguien que no alcanza a percibir las preocupaciones de la gente
535204 est bien que acceda a la conferencia de prensa pero eso no deber a ser una excepci n sino una pr ctica democr tica corriente
535205 la presidenta no dio cuenta de los problemas centrales del pa s no habl de la inflaci n y defini que las acciones de moreno son sus acciones
535206 defendi lo hecho en el indec sin novedades en el gabinete sin novedades respecto a lo sucedido con el conflicto del campo sin novedades en relaci n a moreno y sin novedades respecto a la inflaci n que en realidad estuvo ausente de la conferencia

535297 the star ledger in newark and its sister paper the trenton times are
535298 the cracks could be seen in recent years as the paper like most advance publications dailies was slow to expand to the web while the papers had web sites none of them offer a real breaking news pizzazz or individuality all of the chains cookie cutter sites share the same template and are still among the most difficult to navigate the ledger didnt even offer a daily web video report until this past week

535304 the u s government never discusses the specific security clearance of an individual employee or military member
535305 time honored procedures to examine security clearances on a regular basis to verify information provided by the security clearance holder and traditional steps to ensure that only the appropriate level of security access is granted largely based on the nature of the persons government job
535306 a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats actions and plans
535307 i dont believe that reviewing a persons medical record is part of a typical security investigation unless there is an indication that theres a concern there
535308 and the alternative here is to have a much higher level of scrutiny for everybody in the system i dont particularly want investigators going through my medical records if theres not a reason a security related reason to do that

535321 each federal reserve bank is a separate corporation owned by commercial banks in its region the stock holding commercial banks elect two thirds of each banks nine member board of directors
535322 the federal reserve is a total money making machine it can issue money or checks and it never has a problem of making its checks good because it can obtain the 5 and 10 bills necessary to cover its check simply by asking the treasury departments bureau of engraving to print them
535323 mr chairman we have in this country one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known i refer to the federal reserve board and the federal reserve banks the federal reserve board a government board has cheated the government of the united states and he people of the united states out of enough money to pay the national debt the depredations and the iniquities of the federal reserve board and the federal reserve banks acting together have cost this country enough money to pay the national debt several times over this evil institution has impoverished and ruined the people of the united states has bankrupted itself and has practically bankrupted our government it has done this through the maladministration of that law by which the federal reserve board and through the corrupt practices of the moneyed vultures who control it

535334 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the us
535335 the danger is not that modernization will be sacrificed to fund asymmetric capabilities but rather that in the future we will again neglect the latter
535336 retreat from openness and democracy could have significant security implications for the united states
535337 i dont see either nation as a threat to the united states at this point but they both are investing in modernization programs that are of concern
535338 this approach tailors investment of substantial but not infinite resources in ways that favor key enduring us strategic advantages
535339 at the same time we will continue to improve and refine our capabilities to respond to china if necessary
535340 to bully its neighbors all of which are cause for concern
535341 all of these actions suggest a russia exploring renewed influence and seeking a greater international role

535399 tanas coaching toulon and he was passing through melbourne on his way home
535400 tana was up front with me he said ive spoken sonnys management group and he made sure to keep me in the loop of what was going on
535401 i was certainly aware of his interest in sonny and he was here doing the sly
535402 i made tana aware of what the plans were for sonny not only for the world cup but also our game in new zealand
535403 but who am i to step in and interfere what i can tell you is tana did tell me that he and sonny had been communicating
535404 i havent talked to him since he left australia for france but i know it doesnt look good for me when ive been mentoring the guy and hes pissed off overseas
535405 if sonny hadnt been in a position he was in im not too sure he would have made that move to toulon
535406 had a few other areas in his life been more settled we probably wouldnt be talking today about it
535407 i could sense his frustration with a few things when we talked
535408 it would have been very hard for me to comment or advise him because ive never been in the position he has been in
535409 as a friend those issues are between him and i and thats how they should stay
535410 its not the ideal and i do feel for the bulldogs and the players at the club but unless you know the whole situation its hard to pass judgement
535411 im not saying what he did was the right thing to do but he is a young guy at 22 and we have to look at exactly why he made this decision
535412 i think he was dealing with a lot of issues and i dont think his situation is over

535424 although judicial elections and contributions to elected judges are a well established means of selecting a state judiciary there will be rare cases where campaign expenditures by a litigant create a constitutionally unacceptable appearance of impropriety this is such a case
535425 a line needs to be drawn somewhere to prevent a judge from hearing cases involving a person who has made massive campaign contributions to benefit the judge
535426 people are very aware of who contributes to their campaigns
535427 what do we think the role of the judge is impartial decision maker is the most important aspect of due process all of the other due process type rights mean nothing if we dont have an impartial decision maker
535428 in this area there is a lot of difference of opinion among judges and smoke about whether there are limitations or should be
535429 situations like the one in west virginia do not put those differences to rest
535430 from any and every case in which an independent nonparty organization over which the judicial officer had no control received contributions from individuals or groups which included a person or entity affiliated with a party or an attorney in the case when the independent nonparty organization used its contributions to wage a campaign against the judicial officers electoral opponent
535431 conversely such a standard would likely require a judge also to recuse himself or herself when an independent expenditure group operated against the judge or supported the judges opponent
535432 our judicial system would break down under such a standard for disqualification
535433 this case centers on a very simple fact a man who was the beneficiary of 3 million in expenditures by a single litigant 60 percent of the money raised should not be sitting on cases by that litigant
535434 it would spur judges to seriously reflect on the meaning and letter of the aba standard
535435 on a more systemic basis it would invite and spur states to consider measures that might offer additional protection right now there is an extraordinary lack of predictability that goes with question of whether justice is for sale
535436 in the illinois scenario one could argue the interests of the contributors were arguably more diffuse it was trial lawyers versus defense bar
535437 here it truly involves a sole individual the ceo of a litigant facing a 50 million judgment who personally spent 3 million
535438 a lot of reasonable observers would find it difficult to believe a judge could sit in judgment of person who had given that amount as a campaign contribution without blinking an eye
535439 want to be humanists or fanatics i have no doubt as to my own wish i would rather be a humanist with all his faults than a fanatic with all his virtues

535504 having a child has been the most rewarding experience of my life
535505 thanks to being brought up by a rabid feminist who thought motherhood was about the worst thing that could happen to a woman
535506 you see my mum taught me that children enslave women i grew up believing that children are millstones around your neck and the idea that motherhood can make you blissfully happy is a complete fairytale

535521 this new wave nigel doll that theyve created is just a complete devo rip off and the red hat is exactly the red hat that i designed and its copyrighted and trademarked they didnt ask us anything plus we dont like mcdonalds and we dont like american idol so were doubly offended comment was being sought from mcdonalds
535522 casale said it was ironic the worlds largest fast food chain should appropriate the image of a band known for taking aim at the dysfunction and herd mentality of american society

535539 i know but it aint healthy they need more than just a momma
535540 from day one ive thought it seems like hes troubled
535541 i would like to understand why he has done this if he had a change of heart then certainly we would want to sit down and listen to him
535542 we would want to see him back in the nrl and we would want to see him happy if sonny was to say hes sorry for what he did and admit that he made a mistake we would definitely be a party to hearing him out
535543 if sonny bill were to play overseas certainly the door would be closed on his returning to the nrl at any time in the future
535544 we do not view modern as a trend with a set style one moment angular the next soft and rounded it is more a state of mind which exploits the unique and elegant character imparted by a flowing and purposeful sheer line and receives and translates it into the various other lines and shapes which create the deckhouses and the total yacht

535553 i would push resolution 125 which raised the tax for the first time in argentina since the advent of democracy we have seriously discussed a law that for the first time addressed redistribution of revenue
535554 probably average to a tick below average second base defense
535555 rickies still a below average second baseman defensively but improving he still gets stiff at times
535556 i dont look at the quarterback situation as a question
535557 its just a matter of making a decision on who is going to take the first snap
535558 you can tell it is split among guys about who they want to be the quarterback but we know we have to support either one
535559 weve already had a season when our team got ripped apart and we wont let that happen again
535560 we had way too many egos last year and we had people picking sides we have a whole new face that wont allow that now
535561 those guys are loaded over there but people just dont know the names yet
535562 the top three look and play like the last three guys we had but the new guys are bigger
535563 the linebacking corps takes the responsibility in the switch to the 3 4 as the backbone of this team and theres no reason we shouldnt be able to anchor this thing
535564 the 3 4 has awakened this defense and given it new life
535565 all i ever wanted to do was coach in the nfl your dream is to always coach at the highest level to coach the no 1 draft pick
535566 the thing is its not like were trying to make chicken salad out of chicken droppings

535569 i would remind you that falun gong is an evil fake religion which has been banned by the chinese government
535570 i feel shes very serious about her swimming and very dedicated i admire her for that
535571 when youre an olympian that carries so much meaning so much weight
535572 a lot of olympians wanted to give back but they didnt know how this program is designed only for athletes and it lets them give back
535573 hopefully it will equate to 12 swims i think ill be up for the challenge
535574 i spent a lot more time working on my dry land cross training
535575 in the past few years ive worked less in the pool and put more time in running i lift weights more than i have ive added olympic lifting which not only builds strength it builds athleticism i also do a lot of pilates and have a workout two or three times a week it makes me more athletic on top of that its fun it keeps me in shape my body is lean and strong
535576 i went into it with three individual events and came out with three individual events i was able to break my world record in the 100 back im very confident going into beijing i feel really really good so far i feel great in the water
535577 its very very deep in the back which has kept me on my toes and figuring out ways to be faster
535578 theyre coming from everywhere hopefully ill keep up with the curve its exciting itd be nice to still be significantly ahead it forced me to figure things out in training
535579 because ive gone to the olympics now and know what to expect its not going to be as overwhelming or crazy
535580 i want to really enjoy it ill always have the five medals i already won im an olympian for life theres still a lot of pressure placed on me im able to deal with it
535581 if youre a gold medal winner youre validated im the defending gold medalist the world record holder i have my work cut out for me im expecting great competition i expect to be challenged hopefully ill be able to come out on top
535582 i would never have expected to receive such a prestigious award once let alone two years in a row
535583 mega companies like microsoft and adobe have also been recipients of this award so its definitely an honour my goal is to provide a tool people can use to better understand the most important book ever published the bible
535584 being awarded for designing the best personal interest software means that goal is being achieved
535585 theres a lot of glory in having the torch come here this is our way of showing our support
535586 but we are handling this in a very serious manner
535587 the u s government never discusses the specific security clearance of an individual employee or military member
535588 time honored procedures to examine security clearances on a regular basis to verify information provided by the security clearance holder and traditional steps to ensure that only the appropriate level of security access is granted largely based on the nature of the persons government job
535589 a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats actions and plans
535590 i dont believe that reviewing a persons medical record is part of a typical security investigation unless there is an indication that theres a concern there
535591 and the alternative here is to have a much higher level of scrutiny for everybody in the system i dont particularly want investigators going through my medical records if theres not a reason a security related reason to do that

535596 the met service is expecting only one more band of heavy rain over the waikato today and then the weather will be clearing up until thursday this breathing space will help the river systems to start flushing out but due to the very full river systems in headwater areas we can expect high river levels for some time
535597 its called a long drive period so i didnt let the coaches pull the guys out they had to stay in there for 10 plays as you saw we tried to push the tempo as fast as we could we were getting plays off in 35 seconds so it was realistic game situations and that usually doesnt happen in practice
535598 all of these guys played 10 plays in a row so they can know if boy i am a long ways away from being ready or i am right there i think guys got a real good feeling for where they are at and how far some guys have to go
535599 thursdays night practice was the first time i strapped on full pads for the first time in around two years

535612 best to have never won a major the label he shed in 2004 at the masters and the wgc events are not nearly as prestigious as the majors
535613 they started midway through my career so i havent given them the priority like i do a major or care about like a major said mickelson who has skipped four of the wgcs held overseas
535614 but they are always the best fields in the game theyre always on great golf courses theyre always on tough tests so i think theres a lot of merit to whoever wins those
535615 im certainly overdue appleby said after a birdie on the final hole for a 67
535616 ive been a long time doing this so it would be nice
535617 im proud that ive won on every tour basically i havent won a world golf championship so it would mean a lot and obviously give me a massive amount of confidence going into the next week
535618 i think it will be a fun shootout mickelson said
535619 a few short putts here and there would have made a big difference singh said
535620 sometimes it doesnt go your way sometimes somebody else plays a little bit better
535621 all four of us are playing well mickelson said of the leaders and appleby
535622 i expect at least one and probably two or three us to have good rounds in the 60s tomorrow and force the guys behind us to catch up with birdies

535647 i was just running and i was in the back stretch and i was like you know what you know what this feels good but wait i can actually beat her
535648 i can stay back and let her beat me or i can actually try hard
535649 from that day on she was a totally different runner
535650 i thought maybe that confidence was missing that she thought she couldnt follow a race plan
535651 i really didnt want to because i was a sprinter
535652 so my mom and dad said you have to run practices but you dont have to run races then it was just one race they kept telling me that every time
535653 after i got into it i realized it was the one thing i was better than megan in
535654 the thing that always stands out is how much energy and passion they have and thats contagious
535655 their work ethic when theyre in that groove is beyond anyone
535656 the first year and a half i worked with them they were very talented runners but they couldnt follow directions
535657 i just wanted to do something i could look back on having everyone my family my dad and my mom and my sister and my coach to make all those people proud felt amazing i loved the fact that something i can do like running can make all those people proud including myself which was a bonus
535658 im so proud he made that move and know in his mind he could run that pace
535659 his goal was to make the top 10 and he worked himself hard and ran a time he wasnt really expecting
535660 i figured he could be our top guy and i think if he had more time running kuenzi also played football for silverton he could have been higher than he was
535661 he broke our school record first campbell set it later in the season and because of that he made an impact on our school
535662 kids with really strong base and a strong work ethic can become phenomenal athletes and captains of our team
535663 we knew from training over the summer he was running under 16 20 but at the state level no one knew about him
535664 he learned how hard he had to work at state
535665 for her season we really looked for her to be in the top two at district and she did that but she had to deal with some bruising at state and thats the first time she had to deal with an injury at a big meet
535666 she ran through it and i think she learned from it and it will make her a better runner at the next level
535667 its tougher the state meet to run for yourself if you run for a team you just never let off the hammer shes very much a team type person
535668 i told her all along shed make it under 20 minutes on the state course
535669 she came to us as a freshman with a reputation as a seasoned and talented distance runner running with club teams she has met every expectation and more
535670 she dealt with some sinus problems and at the longer distances she couldnt breath

535745 im still waiting for my patent to clear on my processed cheese food spread to be used on communion wafers
535746 the traditional communion wafers served during roman catholic communion services are made out of two ingredients wheat flour and water in fact during the earliest years of the christian church there was an entire ritual surrounding the process of creating communion wafers beginning with the selection and cleansing of the wheat once the wheat had been properly washed and ground only a baker sanctioned by the local church council could produce communion wafers in a ceremonially shielded iron plated oven eventually certain orders of nuns assumed the responsibility of creating communion wafers which often became a source of income for their convents the standard ingredients still remained wheat flour and water with no seasoning or leavening permitted communion wafers were intended to melt in the recipients mouth as he or she reflected on the sacrifices made by jesus christ during the eucharist service a form of wine or natural grape juice is also served along with the communion wafer modern communion wafers may be embossed with religious symbols or perforated for easier dispensation the priests who serve holy communion may have to consume larger communion wafers also called hosts than those placed on the tongues of congregants there are also larger sheets of communion wafers designed to be broken along pre scored lines religious supply stores often carry several different varieties of communion wafers to address the needs of different christian denominations

535795 just because someone says or plays out their life as a christian doesnt make them one
535796 so you have nothing to prove that christianity and god are a fraud

535820 the first amendment guards religious liberty it does not sanction intentional abuse in religions name
535821 theoretically be tried without mentioning religion the imposition of tort liability for engaging in religious activity to which the church members adhere would have an unconstitutional chilling effect by compelling the church to abandon core principles of its religious beliefs

535840 once the human mind is convinced of the truth of something the incredible power of belief takes over and shields us from seeing the validity of any other point of view the power of belief can shield us from reality itself
535841 enmity against god fear of displeasing god and winding up in hell fueled my obedience to illogical and insane doctrines for years

535853 there is a significant amount of evidence that mr freshwaters teachings regarding subjects related to evolution were not consistent with the curriculum of the mount vernon city schools and state standards
535854 these concerns had been going on for at least 11 years and the school had not done anything
535855 with the exception of the cross burning episode i believe john freshwater is teaching the values of the parents in the mount vernon school district
535856 do you think there are other teachers in the public classroom that are trying to drive their opinions in the classroom

535866 10 me resolv a dejar la religi n y a vivir con las consecuencias cualquier cosa era mejor que continuar viviendo una mentira
535867 es necesario eliminar la religi n para ponernos a favor de nuestros hermanos y no en contra de ellos en el nombre de un ser invisible e inexistente
535868 ahora veo el sufrimiento y la lucha de la gente les doy un peso y derramo una l grima de vez en cuando
535869 pero con tanta ignorancia y pobreza la gente no solamente necesita algo a que aferrarze pero tambien ven el dogma como la unica realidad

535875 even if his life had been saved by catheterization he would have been a candidate for dialysis or a kidney transplant
535876 we processed the scene for evidence but there was little for us to do
535877 the district attorneys office is waiting for the investigation to be complete
535878 but the right to consent to medical treatment may not be the same as the right to refuse medical treatment

535888 if i find out at the end that i was wrong ill burn in hell satisfied that i lived my life with love hurting no one that will be enough for me
535889 this world is an ugly place and religion is the root of it
535890 i think that jp has the right idea and is doing the right thing i dont see that he is kissing anyones ass these people are the parents of the person he loves most in the world and he is honoring that love by creating the best relationship with his in laws that he can
535891 but this person loves me so much everything will be okay
535892 you need to know that we are appalled and we are disgraced by this terrible action an unacceptable action by a minister on our staff
535893 im so sorry for the injury that this kind of behavior has brought to many people in our church and outside of our church
535894 weve taken a hit from the enemy this week but we will rise above and respond to the challenge

535900 john morris went to the microphone and identified himself as a petroleum geologist
535901 morton chopped him off at the ankles two questions said morton what oil company did you work for well uh actually morris never worked for an oil company but he once taught petroleum engineering at the university of oklahoma second how old is the earth if the earth is more than 10 000 years old then scripture has no meaning morton then said that he had hired several graduates of christian heritage college and that all of them suffered severe crises of faith the were utterly unprepared to face the geologic facts every petroleum geologist deals with on a daily basis morton neglected to add that icr is much better known for ignoring or denying problems than dealing with them
535902 i have secretly entertained suspicions of a trojan horse roaming behind the lines
535903 from your oil industry experience did any fact that you were taught at icr which challenged current geological thinking turn out in the long run to be true
535904 john morris went to the microphone and identified himself as a petroleum geologist

535908 eris discordia im curious how do you know that your divine spark will be liberated and you will continue on
535909 so he gives up the whole fantasy of jesus he thinks for himself without fetters that induces mental freedom and ability to reason with oneself knowing it is himself
535910 the hottest place in hell is reserved for those who remain neutral in times of great moral conflict
535911 nobody knows what happens when you die nobody knows what happens when you die believe what you want it doesnt mean youre right and that is a fact of life
535912 did you read that 1 out of 5 atheists still believe in god
535913 i have something about it at my new blog called debunking atheists
535914 if you are really interested in seeking truth or are you seeking like minded people for validation of your beliefs
535915 raise your children with jesus and hell be with them all theirs lives
535916 brainwash them when theyre young and theyll never be able to get over it
535917 i am an atheist i do not believe in god
535918 so by this small poll at this blog over 90 of you do not claim atheism and have a belief in god
535919 there is no such thing as an ex christian honey
535920 i am a former member of the centrist christian churches church of christ
535921 prove biblically that there is an exchristian and i will consider your points
535922 any intelligent adult can plainly see that in employing such a tactic i am simply asking you to first assume that my position is true and then asking you to prove it false clever huh ta da
535923 christians should not be a thermometers that merely record and reflect the temperature of popular opinion
535924 prove biblically using the bible that there is an exchristian and i will consider your points
535925 the propitiation for the sins debts of the whole world
535926 if he had been on earth he would not even have been a priest
535927 the tent of his priesthood is a greater and more perfect one not made by mens hands that is not belonging to this created world
535928 for christ has entered not that sanctuary made by mens hands which is only a symbol of reality but heaven itself only to appear now before god on our behalf
535929 we especially see the first systematic organization of biblical hosts of heaven into a hierarchy of different castes of angels governing and serving on different levels of heaven
535930 jesus who was made a little lower than the angels now crowned with glory and honor
535931 the shed blood of the executed jesus was imputed by god to suffice as if it were the shed blood of all guilty men and women whom god chose to save from hell creator makes the rules ask him why mt 26 28
535932 so robert do you have any actual proof for your claim
535933 when one of the chosen sins he is out of covenant with christ he must first grant forgiveness to others before he asks for forgiveness from god for his own sin mt 6 14 15
535934 you believe in magnetic power because you see its results but dont see its lines of force
535935 you believe in radio television and telephone waves because you see their results but you dont see their waves of force
535936 you believe in a builder of homes because you see the results not because you saw the construction
535937 you know of the moon stars and the earth because you see the results not because you saw the construction
535938 magnetism electricity planets amp solar systems demonstrate an intelligence beyond that of man
535939 for thousands of years the relatively constant revolution of earth around the sun every 365 days its rotation every 24 hours its tilt of 23 5 degrees demonstrates an intelligence far beyond that of man
535940 that intelligence is god the creator of these things that man cannot create
535941 why would so many disciples endure torture and death to substantiate a lie
535942 muhammad wrote of jesus in the koran he is not a christian why would he lie or support a lie
535943 so robert do you have any actual proof for your claim
535944 i dont know how the universe came to be but i believe it was done supernaturally
535945 www what the hell is hell com which is tentmaker orgs sister site at first i thought it was a jehovahs witness site or something but gary amirault was a universalist believer i had never really heard of this type of message that the entire world will be saved
535946 because i was scared scared that i might be wrong scared that maybe god didn t exist and that we were all alone on this earth
535947 what if i raised myself all alone on a desert island would i still have come up with any such ideas about a god
535948 if you knew for a fact that your child was going to hell would you have that kid
535949 its people like you hokey boy who glory in the fantasy of other human beings being tortured in sadisitic agony for all eternity for the ridiculous thought crime of disbelief in christians imagniary friend
535950 the concept of hell didnt fit the mold of a loving god
535951 remember man chose to turn his back on god god did not create us to be robots
535952 love me worship me and give me your life or ill fucking burn you forever and ever and make you suffer for billions and billions and billions of years and even after that
535953 iran is preparing for war check the news today the west is weakened militarily current wars on various fronts financially credit crunch wreaking havoc politically weak leaders and morally bankrupt europe is coming together into an uncomfortable superpower as prophesied in the bible
535954 correct me if im wrong but as i wade through the apologetic puke this is the strongest
535955 do we trust the bible its a book that shouldnt be written off it maps out how the world will end it prophesied that israel would return to the home land this has come to pass it prophesies armageddon the stage is set iran is preparing for war check the news today the west is weakened militarily current wars on various fronts financially credit crunch wreaking havoc politically weak leaders and morally bankrupt europe is coming together into an uncomfortable superpower as prophesied in the bible
535956 notwithstanding another thing you evidently cannot absorb is that our skepticism on this matter is intrumental that is it is a key element in fulfilling your biblegods
535957 myths taken literally are a nightmare i do however find value in myths read as poetry rather than prose
535958 at the end of the day we are just people and that is a marvelous and wonderful thing so few are really comfortable with that but that is what reality is all about us we are not gods would a god go to wal mart and buy toilet paper
535959 religion is not even the major melody of the symphony of life the true the beautiful and the good are far deeper strains
535960 father forgive them for they know not what they do
535961 me forgive them for they know not what they do
535962 heaven is when you dont have to ask the price of something while shopping hell is when theres not enough money to paid the bills every month
535963 if god is an all loving god why did he create hell and send people there
535964 in every persons life god has given them the opportunity to accept his mercy and grace through jesus
535965 you might have gained knowledge about god but failed to actually know establish a real relationship with him
535966 one question for you do you still believe in the bible
535967 what bad thing did god not church people because they can be as wicked as anyone else which is sad ever do to anyone of you to feel towards him in the way you do
535968 well on the other hand what if islam is true and youre wrong
535969 shes up on the roof and we cant get her down
535970 people think agnostics are all at sea so we chose this symbol
535971 if it wasnt for agnosticism i would know what to believe
535972 by now i expected to be a seasoned parish minister wearing black clergy shirts grown gray from frequent washing
535973 today those vestments are hanging in the sacristy of an anglican church in kenya my church pension is frozen and i am as likely to spend sunday mornings with friendly quakers presbyterians or congregationalists as i am with the episcopalians who remain my closest kin sometimes i even keep the sabbath with a cup of steaming assam tea on my front porch watching towhees vie for the highest perch in the poplar tree while god watches me these days i earn my living teaching school not leading worship and while i still dream of opening a small restaurant in clarkesville or volunteering at an eye clinic in nepal there is no guarantee that i will not run off with the circus before i am through this is not the life i planned or the life i recommend to others but it is the life that has turned out to be mine and the central revelation in it for me that the call to serve god is first and last the call to be fully human seems important enough to witness to on paper this book is my attempt to do that
535974 if my other books have been whole milk books this is my single malt scotch book which is the main thing i want to speak with you about tonight
535975 making the move from sermon to memoir has been one of the more strenuous passages in my life and it also makes the reviews a whole lot scarier to read
535976 a preacher who wants to keep his or her job would do well to avoid trying to say anything true about sex money politics war or existential despair in church it is also not a good idea to question established readings of scripture or tradition
535977 while i knew plenty of clergy willing to complain about the high expectations and long hours few of us spoke openly about the toxic effects of being identified as the holiest person in a congregation
535978 we were not god but we spent so much tending the god place in people s lives that it was easy to understand why someone might get us confused
535979 in 1997 after fifteen years of full time parish ministry i left my little church in the north georgia foothills of the appalachians to become a college teacher
535980 i learned to prize holy ignorance more highly than religious certainty
535981 after praying and praying for clarity an direction and getting nothing i started losing faith and trust in god so i decided to do some in depth research to affirm what i believed i learned that everything i believed to be true had either been proven to be false or had no proof to back it up besides the basic tennants of the christian faith didnt line up with what i believed in my heart to be true i prayed against this i really did i really did ask god to come into my heart and renew my faith send me a sign something nothing happened i have decided that as a grown adult capable of making my own decisions that i would rather live my life being honest with myself and those around me instead of being a total fraud and fake hate myself and burn in hell anyway if god knows my heart i would think he would rather me be an honest person than not
535982 move in the opposite direction as a form of self defense
535983 when a religion is good i conceive it will support itself and when it does not support itself so that its professors are obliged to call for the help of the civil power tis a sign i apprehend of its being a bad one
535984 love me or i will banish you to eternal torment
535985 whether it is an alive or dead experience depends on our staying connected with jesus john 15
535986 history does not record anywhere a religion that has any rational basis
535987 religion does nothing to make the world peaceful religious sects of christianity islam buddhism etc each thinking they are the only one that is right and every one else should be eradicated from the planet
535988 if the energy that presumably makes up the personality i e the soul exists independently of the physical brain why then do people who suffer from comas stroke alzheimers and other brain defective ailments lose their personalities
535989 the extent and effect of brain injury is often assessed by the use of neurological examination neuroimaging and neuropsychological assessment
535990 i think it fascinating that folks live an absolutely hopeless life regarding lad
535991 if it really doesnt matter to you one way or the other why not
535992 if christians are right heaven is an awesome place to go yes
535993 credible evidence of any of this would be great plus what joe said
535994 my eyes were beholding the luminous energy of the light of god and my entire being pulsated with ecstasy as i acknowledged the presence of god i recognized the light again and i was overjoyed beyond words
535995 every nook and cranny of my being was bombarded with what seemed to be a nuclear explosion of unconditional love
535996 so a very few will be saved its still a great multitude of millions shall the clay question the potter
535997 we can do as we please because there is no god therefore i am acountable to nobody
535998 we can do as we please because there is no god therefore i am acountable to nobody
535999 this doesnt mean we shouldnt strive to become like jesus
536000 this doesnt mean we shouldnt strive to become like jesus
536001 hello my good friend i am ezekiel and this is my friend jebediah we think you would be interested in our jesus insurance policy if you follow this short list of rules throws a big ass bible at you and dont manage to stab yourself in the neck with a fuckin fork tryin to make sense of it all then youll live in a really neato place called heaven where the water is clean they have brita pitchers the fruit contains no pesticides and holy shit there wont even be roaches in your apartment
536002 yo man that sounds good and all but im doin alright here

536004 good thing you are very bothered about hell because you understood the consequences of sin you fear god which is a good thing
536005 god loves you and you will surely be rewarded if you serve him faithfully
536006 god is loving therefore hell is not a physical burning place but a place of complete isolation where the only suffering is emotional but this is only for those that actively lead others astray
536007 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
536008 for god so hated humanity that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever does not believe in him will not perish but have everlasting life being tortured for all eternity in hell without hope of forgiveness
536009 for god so loved the world that he gave didomi delivered bestowed as a gift put himself in our place his one and only son huios term of relationship and association that whoever relies upon pisteuo trusts and believes in him shall not perish apollumi be destroyed be lost abolished put to an end and become dead but have eternal life aionios zoe
536010 1 a sensory experience of something that does not exist outside the mind caused by various physical and mental disorders or by reaction to certain toxic substances and usually manifested as visual or auditory images
536011 yes god is merciful and just im sure the people in myanmar have been praising him for weeks now
536012 then tote at that time he said multitudes ethnos races specifically gentiles peoples and nations large groups based upon religious political cultural or geographic ties shall be awakened and rise up egeiro become aroused from a deadly sleep to stand up and make war upon and against nations ethnos races and peoples and royal rulers against royal rulers you will hear about wars and rumors of wars people will be terrorized throeo cry out loud frightened and alarmed and great megas big powerful and numerous hurricanes earthquakes and tsunamis seismos shaking commotion rocking to and fro and agitation on land and sea shall come to exist esomai down against low kata places topos inhabited areas and famines limos scarcity of harvests and food and pestilence loimos infectious epidemic diseases that are virulent and devastating destructive and pernicious plagues and terrorist activity phobetron terrorism and alarming events and great megas signs semeion indications unusual occurrences and wonders transcending the normal course of nature shall be esomai from apo proceed out of the sky ouranos the universe the abode of stars and the heavens but de all these things just begin to initiate arche the birth pangs odin
536013 world wars famines hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis pandemics riotous acts of lawlessness acts of terrorism signs in the sky false prophets a lukewarm assembly or
536014 man is wont to make god infinite in all areas saying that he is omnipresent omnipotent and all knowing but yahuweh only says that his power and mercy are unlimited as well as his existence for god to be omnipresent and thus to be unlimited in scale or size he ceases to be a unique individual becoming the universe itself and thus would be in all things from rocks to slugs for god to be all knowing there would be no merit to creation or to forming a relationship with other individuals these are things he wants to experience to enjoy and to grow from also relevant yahweh specifically tells us that the sins of those who are born anew into his family are no longer known to him and he makes no attempt to know those who make no effort to know him
536015 love is the one thing that cannot be compelled even by an omnipotent deity it can t be forced bought stolen held for ransom or even manufactured but it can be earned it can t be sold or bartered but it can be given away here s the bottom line the capacity to love requires the capacity not to love if the object of yahuweh s affection cannot reject him then accepting him becomes meaningless
536016 think upon the lines of fairness and justice these people who actively lead others astray are purposefully and knowingly deceiving people so as to lead them away from god
536017 dont expect to be rewarded for not wanting to be with him
536018 ungodly men suppress the truth that which is known about god is evident within them for god made it evident to them for since the creation of the cosmos his invisible attributes his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen being understood through what has been made so that they are without excuse for even though they knew of god they did not revere him as god they became futile in their speculations and their foolish hearts were darkened professing to be wise they became fools exchanging the radiance of the incorruptible god for an image in the form of corruptible man of nature and animals they exchanged the truth of god for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the creator
536019 nor shall you go up by steps to my altar that your nakedness may not be exposed on it
536020 astreja gods existence is undeniable his word is truth he has proven himself truthful in his words
536021 plus archaeological evidence proves that events that happened in scripture actually did happen exactly as he said they did
536022 he has a 100 accuracy record in fulfilling prophecy down to the very day
536023 you must provide proof of gods existence until such a time then as far as i am concerned there is no god even though i do not have to provide evidence because as the current situation stands i win regardless and will simply deny anything you say
536024 seventy weeks of years shabuwa are decreed for your people and for your set apart city to finish the transgression to make an end of sin to make atonement for iniquity to bring forth everlasting righteousness to seal up the revelation and prophecy and to anoint the most set apart know and understand that from the going forth of the command to restore and rebuild jerusalem until messiah the prince there shall be seven weeks and sixty two weeks of years the way shall be built again and the means of separation even in troublesome times and after the sixty two weeks messiah shall be cut off but not for himself
536025 and it came to pass in the month of nisan in the twentieth year of king artaxerxes when i nehemiah said to the king if it pleases the king and if your servant has found favor in your sight i ask that you send me to yahuwdah to the city of my fathers tombs that i may rebuild it so it pleased the king to send me
536026 seventy weeks of years shabuwa are decreed for your people and for your set apart city to finish the transgression to make an end of sin to make atonement for iniquity to bring forth everlasting righteousness to seal up the revelation and prophecy and to anoint the most set apart know and understand that from the going forth of the command to restore and rebuild jerusalem until messiah the prince there shall be seven weeks and sixty two weeks of years the way shall be built again and the means of separation even in troublesome times and after the sixty two weeks messiah shall be cut off but not for himself
536027 the bible is just full of errors for example jer 25 11 12 states this entire land shall become a desolate wasteland israel and her neighboring lands shall serve the king of babylon for seventy years then when seventy years of captivity are over i will punish the king of babylon and his people for their sins says the lord i will make the country of the babylonians an everlasting wasteland in the book of daniel the author states that the prophecy is about jerusalem and not israel as jeremiah clearly states jeremiah and daniel were also both wrong about the length of the exile the babylonians took jerusalem in 587 586 bc rewriting the bible p154 and cyrus the great not the mysterious darius the mede of dan 9 1 conquered babylon in 538 bc rtb p156 he also proclaimed that the jews could return home in the first year of his reign ezr 1 1 4 this is at most 49 years and even if we are generous and take the start of the prophecy as 597 bc when the babylonians first laid siege to jerusalem the bible uneathed p293 that still only totals 59 years during that time neither israel nor jerusalem lay desolate tbu pp 305 308 and babylon was not destroyed by cyrus in fact alexander the great 356 321 bc may have considered using the city as his capital the babylonians an introduction p67 in other words the prophets of the bible were just plain wrong
536028 chapter nine daniel jumps back to the non existent reign of darius this time identifying him as the son of xerxes daniel 9 1 there was a persian king by the name of darius but he was the father of xerxes and he didn t rule until 425 bc at which time anyone who lived during the reign of nebuchadrezzar would have been impossibly old daniel tries to salvage a failed prophecy of jeremiah jeremiah 29 10 by changing jeremiah s 70 years until the re establishment of the kingdom of judah to 70 weeks of years 490 years daniel 9 24 unfortunately for daniel nothing special happened at the end of the 490 years about 96 bc either daniel then talks about a messiah annointed one a prince who will after 7 weeks of years 49 years will make it possible to rebuild the temple daniel 9 25 the first temple was destroyed in 586 bc 49 years later would be 537 bc which is about the time cyrus the persian gave the jews permission to rebuild their temple then after 62 weeks of years messiah will be cut off this would be about 104 bc this might be a reference to onias iii a high priest who opposed the seleucids but he was executed in 171 bc for the week 7 years after that seleucid persecution was at its worst which seems to fit the rest of the verse in 168 bc antiochus iv took jerusalem and ordered the temple dedicated to zeus this fits with daniel 9 27 in 165 bc the temple was cleansed and rededicated to yahweh
536029 you must provide proof of gods existence until such a time then as far as i am concerned there is no god even though i do not have to provide evidence because as the current situation stands i win regardless and will simply deny anything you say
536030 first i want to say to everyone that no matter what i say you will not believe or understand because you enjoy refuting everything
536031 when somebody claims to be an atheist they have faith that they are right
536032 atheism is a religion whether you like it or not
536033 i say that the god of the bible is the only god you want me to prove it first prove to me that i am wrong
536034 prove to me that there is no god it really looks like we are in the same boat
536035 and if somebody from another denomination or no denomination is following jesus then they are my brother and sister in christ
536036 morality is based on human suffering this is why we feel no moral obligation to rocks
536037 if you dont think the way we do and you dont become a christian then we will torture you and slaughter you
536038 if you dont agree with me you are thinking unclearly
536039 muttmutt you really should define what a christian is because i am one of them and i know that most of the people in the usa are not christian
536040 honestly why ask her him it would make much more sense not to mention economize on time to hear such a definition from a true christian first hand
536041 so you dont believe in jesus christ any longer because there are some inconsistencies between the bible and your own beliefs
536042 christianity is not here to enslave people or control societies
536043 i would love to tell you of many more things that are happening in our current society that is paving the way for
536044 for a god who desires people to follow him in love he sure seems to enjoy giving satan reign over the earth
536045 and again christianity is not god the things that people do in the name of christianity often do not represent god such as the crusades
536046 but if i can use facts from today and show in the bible how these things must come to pass to fulfill prophecy
536047 also which emerging situations are threatening all life on earth
536048 i think when christians say that then theyre assuming the atheist believes the theory of evolution i guess theyre not distinguishing the difference can we agree that atheists agree with the theory of evolution which is an unproven science and requires some level of faith to believe
536049 an oracle concerning damascus see damascus will cease to be a city and will become a heap of ruins her towns will be deserted forever
536050 thus says the lord god and the land of egypt shall be a desolation and a waste no foot of man shall pass through it and no foot of beast shall past through it it shall be uninhabited for forty years and i will make the city of egypt a desolation in the midst of desolated countries and her cities shall be desolated forty years i will scatter egyptian among the nations and disperse them through the countries
536051 in scientific usage a theory does not mean an unsubstantiated guess or hunch as it can in everyday speech
536052 to believe in your heart that evolution is fact when its not proven by science does require a level of faith
536053 its taught as the most acceptable explanation that science can give as to the origin of human life but there is no such evidence that has proven it as fact
536054 science is limited to that which can be physically proven right
536055 under that rule can science agree that love exists i dont think it can
536056 im saying science by its very nature cant recognize everything that exists
536057 thats eternal damnation been the basis of most atheists arguments
536058 you webmdave have your perception of what a god should be the god of the bible does not fit and thus youve dismissed him as god i completely understand
536059 christianity is a belief and beliefs do not murder people people murder people
536060 when there is no place in the bible that calls christians to act in that regard
536061 did you forget that atheists have done evil things in the name of atheism ask joseph stalin was he a good atheist
536062 also your argument of a self fullfilling prophecy could hold water if christians were in control of world events christians are not the ones pulling the strings
536063 concerning education do you know who writes the textbooks for public schools its not christians
536064 i dont see how christians can be blamed for holding up scientific discovery when christians arent in charge
536065 theres no acknowledgement of god in the schools they simply treat him as though he doesnt exist
536066 you seem to be compassionate at your choosing any defense for the tens of millions of innocent babies that are cut up and vacuumed out of their mothers wombs have those babies been dehumanized to the point that youre okay with that
536067 they creation evolution debates all come to a stalemate because there is no earthly smoking gun evidence that either claim is absolutely positively correct
536068 if i must accept that science as you guys said can t prove anything but can only infer then when i look at the bible if i m able to accept it as truth i m without dilemma that s the simple difference between the faithful and the faithless
536069 i spend a lot of time listening to creation evolution debates basically they all come to a stalemate because there is no earthly smoking gun evidence that either claim is absolutely positively correct
536070 the child s outcome was already decided by god before that human time actually arrived
536071 concerning abortion a simple no to the first question and yes to my second question would have sufficed
536072 seems to me that abortion goes against the idea of human evolution
536073 well we do things to make the earth a better place
536074 the love of god is what draws men to repentence not scientific evidence
536075 is there ever even a consideration of what if im wrong for you guys im sincerely interested if you all have considered the what if
536076 whats the point in helping people of 3rd world countries whats the point in going to work whats the point of life i kill you you kill me who cares we all kill each other in a million years none of it matters
536077 oh well you feel you owe it to people of lesser intellect than you to expose this religion yadda yadda well why whats the point who cares
536078 for those youre able to convince then what they join your cause why to teach someone else that their life is not valuable that theyre worthless too and soon theyll be gone
536079 hi my name is istillbelieve and i have no objective evidence for my beliefs i have faith
536080 well we do things to make the earth a better place
536081 who really cares if atrocities are carried out in the name of religions those people didnt matter they were going to die one way or another life is pointless shall we just blow up the earth to save ourselves from our misery
536082 mr arvo some of your comments are silly too sir
536083 and i do see you guys for exactly who you are thats why im here
536084 do you understand how crazy it is that you continue to respond to me why are you wasting your time on me do you think you will change my mind
536085 we did already agree that you are without faith so your first 2 paragraphs have been established already
536086 we are not animals we have reason we have love we have emotions we are a special creation nothing like any other being on this planet
536087 its not an accident that you are here and your life has more value than you even understand
536088 if someone doesnt want to care for the human then they should have the right to kill it i dont think you believe that do you
536089 is there ever even a consideration of what if im wrong for you guys
536090 were no more important than an extinct species of animal
536091 do you really think that the things that make you who you are is just your brain
536092 when your heart stops you will cease to exist and your life will only be remembered by that current generation
536093 i dont know much about krishna but i dont think that he made the same claims that jesus made
536094 i am able to accept the bible as truth and i am able to accept its claims because of my own experiences and observations of things i can accept as evidence
536095 you guys dont believe in a god because you do not accept anything as evidence that there is the existence of a god
536096 many of us do not believe in a god simply because weve seen no evidence for such a being that we regard as being credible
536097 you asked if i ever wonder if im wrong about islam
536098 is it fair to say that some reject christianity because of the hypocrisy of its proclaimed believers
536099 it scares me since i believe the bible that my actions could be the thing that deters someone from accepting christ scared that my faults will result in another person rejecting christ and them spending eternity in hell
536100 would you agree with me then that as far as you know there is no reason to believe him krishna to be divine or indeed anything more than a myth
536101 there are many unanswered questions in my mind and even the things that are fairly settled i am willing to revisit if someone makes an interesting argument or presents some evidence
536102 in my experience they are usually nothing more than a catalyst referring to mistreatment by peers an observation that prompts one to look deeper you will find many testimonies here from people who were mistreated by christians but did not leave the faith without first thoroughly investigating it and concluding that it had little if any factual support
536103 im assuming that you regard the bible as an accurate record of this mans actions and words
536104 i find it very interesting that mere humans can author a book that conveys
536105 i answer yes i agree i do not see any evidence for such a being krishna that i regard as credible
536106 jesus will change your life if you invite him into your heart
536107 krishna will change your life if you invite him into your heart
536108 what could someone possibly submit to you as evidence to the existence of god can you imagine anything that you would regard as credible evidence in your wildest dreams
536109 i cant imagine what kind of credible evidence led them to the faith if their faith was so shaky to go searching to refute it on the simple basis of being hurt by a peer
536110 yes i do believe the bible is an accurate record and i do so because ive accepted the bible as truth
536111 here is my question to you will you please ask god to tell you what it the date and time specific image is and then post it here
536112 i have chosen an image such that if you were to get it right i would be shaken to my very core as i have not written it down or communicated it in any way to another person
536113 if i seem to you the way william seems to me
536114 may i be the 2nd to say that if god reveals your images to me that ill certainly get back with you
536115 god told me i dont need to prove its existence
536116 we at bethlehem baptist church are deeply grieved and sorrowed by these serious charges
536117 i was more than taken aback when i heard it i said no not him it cant be him
536118 we at bethlehem baptist church are deeply grieved and sorrowed by these serious charges
536119 i was more than taken aback when i heard it i said no not him it cant be him
536120 after our first trip to china my wife and i knew our lives were changing our eyes and hearts were opening to how big god really is and we have wanted to experience more of that
536121 weve really wondered whether or not we should just go to china and stay there
536122 well i guess it was her time to go god called her home
536123 why would a loving god permit the 5 year old daughter of a well known christian music star to not only be accidentally killed but killed by that stars very own son her brother
536124 how much guilt will this dead girls brother have to deal with for the rest of his life
536125 gods will is gods will it is unchangable unchallengable preordained and everything that happens is for our own good
536126 why would this christian god punish an entire christian family in such a manner
536127 could it be that god just sat back and did nothing to stop this while the devil had some of his mean old fun with this god loving christian family
536128 see the street where this happened just two pieces of white trash we dont have to deal with anymore
536129 i have just been inspired to completely revise kubler ross version and come up with my version of the many stages of grief which in this case i would like to differently call the frankenstein 5 stages of good grief
536130 i dedicate it to all the big and small losers in the world the very first ones being the steven curtis chapman family
536131 after our first trip to china my wife and i knew our lives were changing our eyes and hearts were opening to how big god really is and we have wanted to experience more of that
536132 weve really wondered whether or not we should just go to china and stay there

536134 about a certain communitys fears of him fears of danger versus actual danger
536135 adam is 13 and growing so his behaviors grow increasingly difficult for his parents to manage
536136 hes never knocked down anyone hes never urinated on anyone or spit on anyone
536137 does not have the same status as attending mass otherwise we could all just sit home and watch it on tv and not bother to come in
536138 its considered a sin in the catholic church not to attend mass on sundays and every holy day of obligation
536139 and thats what this is about im just trying to fulfill my obligations
536140 adams continued presence on parish grounds not only endangers the parishioners it is disruptive to the devout celebration of the eucharist
536141 i have repeatedly asked john and carol to keep adam from church they have refused to do so
536142 in fact carol told our parish council that she would have to be dragged from church in handcuffs if i tried to keep adam from attending mass
536143 i think this case is mostly about not understanding autism
536144 i wanted to show them another example ultimately we just need more people to truly understand autism
536145 uhhhh as much as i hate to admit it i have to side with the church on this one sounds like the kid is out of control and is in need of professional help and so does the mom for that matter

536162 her first words were she was very happy to see very nice people she was ecstatic

536186 the fairways are contoured the bunkers are deep in the landing areas the green complexes are quite challenging and exciting and have so much movement they can be scary
536187 that has been our philosophy not to get in the way
536188 we want to allow the players to show their skills and let them identify who the best player is by making it fair challenging while allowing a variety of shots

536208 the iraqi government broke their branches and took down their tree
536209 they used to come and order us to give them 100 gas canisters
536210 they used to brag that they were in the mahdi army now they are afraid to say it out loud
536211 the sadr office used to be the soul of the militia
536212 you still get punished if you talk bad about them
536213 the main motive is to exclude the sadr movement from politics
536214 the u s government never discusses the specific security clearance of an individual employee or military member
536215 time honored procedures to examine security clearances on a regular basis to verify information provided by the security clearance holder and traditional steps to ensure that only the appropriate level of security access is granted largely based on the nature of the persons government job
536216 a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats actions and plans
536217 i dont believe that reviewing a persons medical record is part of a typical security investigation unless there is an indication that theres a concern there
536218 and the alternative here is to have a much higher level of scrutiny for everybody in the system i dont particularly want investigators going through my medical records if theres not a reason a security related reason to do that
536219 how can you keep up with her this woman who is always reading another book besides the one before her eyes a book that does not yet exist but which since she wants it cannot fail to exist

536223 tony blair continues to be 100 supportive of gordon brown and the government
536224 junked the tb policy agenda but had nothing to put in its place
536225 he really needed to be seen as continuing nl not ditching it by trying to be change he played exactly the same game the media wanted but never the game that gives us the only chance of a fourth term
536226 the real problem was not the brilliance of the tory conference but the hubris and vacuity of our own
536227 this meant the tories by having something to say on policy appeared substantial and to represent the future
536228 in moral terms government cannot stand aside and watch families being driven into fuel poverty

536239 i will not talk in mrs smarts class so that i will not disturb the education of others
536240 brazil will certainly assume its responsibility to preserve the amazon to combat global warming
536241 talk as if they own the amazon but we know what it represents to humanity and to brazil and what needs to be done will be done
536242 our war isnt against last months deforestation numbers its against a model that leaves people impoverished and that destroys the rainforest
536243 this is the first time brazil is accepting the link between global warming and preserving the forest
536244 for a long time brazil was violently opposed to this insisting fossil fuel was to blame thats true historically speaking but today forests play an important role
536245 we cut it back a little bit because we were a little shorthanded at a couple of positions defensive tackle with brian young being held out and hollis thomas the same way and we were short at receiver as well but it will give us some good film to watch tomorrow these guys will come in in the afternoon and well review the tape theyll lift and then well install again for a monday two a day a schedule thats where were at as far as the itinerary im sure there will be a number of things that well need to clean up and correct you can see some of that from the field and there will be some things that well be encouraged about im sure overall i think guys stayed mostly healthy for the guys that did participate we had a couple of little nicks but nothing really serious
536246 a 25 percent drop in fertility is the equivalent of a 25 percent drop in the reproductive population it remains to be seen whether other species exhibit the same effect but translated to commercially and ecologically important species such as lobsters crabs mussels and fish acidification would have far reaching consequences
536247 species with limestone skeletons or shells are hit particularly hard when the ph drops through a drop in ability to grow and a rise in mortality but and its a big but we dont yet know enough about the effects of acidification in the sea and i hope im wrong about the wider consequences of our results
536248 close to 99 of conservation dollars donated go to land causes and 1 to oceans
536249 we have always asked nascar for a nationwide race or a truck race and theres never been room in the schedule
536250 now theres room in the schedule nascar has not called me up and said hey were going to go to iowa they have said they really like our track they like what it looks like
536251 at this point im not going to speculate ive got my fingers crossed i hope we get it but they have never come up to me and said youre getting it heres the date were absolutely 100 percent at their mercy
536252 i raced there in late models and theres three grooves in late models id hate to see what itd do in a nationwide car it would open up pretty good
536253 rusty did a nice job designing the place everything from the track surface to the campgrounds and the stands and the club seats the bus lot every garage has a drain for your cool down units so you dont have water all over the place everything is so nice and state of the art youd be crazy not to go there
536254 tony gibson crew chief and i talked about things after the race in june with our notes and what wed like to try this time to make the car better
536255 we need to make the car a little better so we just went over those notes and incorporated those changes that we were going to try and well make adjustments i would have to think were way ahead of 50 percent of the field
536256 now there is a lot of ways to win these races you can be the fastest car out there or you can be one of the group behind the fastest car and still win
536257 for me to have won at indy i would have had to have things really go my way because johnson had the fastest car sixty percent or 65 percent of the time the fastest car wins the other 35 40 percent of the time someone else is able to pull it off but our car was clearly better than 11th at indy
536258 we need to make it better than it was in race setup last time here
536259 we improved the qualifying setup a little bit so if we can find some things that will make the car stay strong longer into the run than it did last time then we can be a contender
536260 it is just really tough to beat johnson right now like i said we will do everything we can to have the fastest best car and have all the best decisions and then we have to rely on what fate or whatever we have to rely on some other things to line up for us
536261 in the beginning tony and i were just trying to get on the same page and we were missing it a little bit
536262 but now when i tell him i need a little bit of this or a little bit of that hes got it down pat
536263 maybe this is our lucky sunday i would love to go to victory lane with these guys
536264 ill be careful about what i say going forward i have great respect for how hard this stuff is i have educated most of the media for years about being overly optimistic and i really wanted indy to work out it didnt but we gave it a great go
536265 i feel like the mix is perfect right now for me
536266 between wonderful equipment that dei is putting me in the team and tony gibsons attitude the opportunity to be working so closely with dei development driver aric almirola the schedule for a year and a half that i have had plenty of weekends off yes i am 100 percent rejuvenated
536267 i really know today how much racing means to me and i would answer a lot of questions differently today than i would have a year and a half ago or two years ago about this sport one of which would be why would i want to go to a race if i wasnt driving
536268 well if i couldnt drive i would still want to be a part of a race team right now i feel differently toward it than i did when i was so burned out from 19 years straight i love it this is where my friends are this is where i belong
536269 just an incredible talent and such a fine young man
536270 just to give you an example of what kind of commitment hes made he has stood by and watched me run three quarters of the races this year he has been at almost every race listened to every conversation watching every bit of it and he was one of my two spotters at indy
536271 dont forget that name and in 10 or 15 years from now youll know hes earned it and im proud to be working with him
536272 my role at hendrick motorsports will include some mentoring long term but short term they want to run for a championship in 09
536273 but long term they want to mentor another young man either brad keselowski or landon cassill
536274 for me as ive said before its an incredible honor to work with these young people but especially incredible to be invited into hendrick motorsports at this stage of my career its still phenomenal i still just cant believe it there must be some mistake
536275 ive got two young guys in brad keselowski and landon cassill that are coming along real fast ones 24 keselowski and ones soon to be 19 cassill and there are other options out there too
536276 when we had two manufacturers here we saw i believe it was four cars on the lead lap at north wilkesboro we saw track records being broken we really didnt see better racing we saw more tire failures because the manufacturers were forced to put more emphasis on making the cars drive a certain way i drove on hoosiers by no means is it my opinion that we would make goodyear step up and do a better job if we had two manufacturers here im in complete opposition of that
536277 in order for goodyear to do a better job we have to find a way to integrate with the teams more we have to find a way to let the people that do it every day that spend their whole life on these racecars become more a part of the process we dont know how to build tires we have not a clue how to build tires goodyear does a really good job of that goodyear could benefit from using the teams more than we are actually able to do now thats my opinion
536278 hi bob its nice to meet you so bob where do you
536279 i will die alone upside down in a pub toilet
536280 i will die alone upside down in a pub toilet
536281 herr bsirske soll in der s dsee bleiben wenn er jetzt nicht zur cktritt sollten ihm die gewerkschafter den stuhl vor die t r setzen
536282 das ist bei gewerkschaftsfunktion ren leider nichts neues diejenigen die den moralischen zeigefinger am h chsten heben halten am ungeniertesten die hand auf damit verraten leute wie bsirske die anliegen der mitglieder die sie gew hlt haben
536283 weve got a different world today with this car and this is the first time weve run this car on these big tracks there is 40 50 percent less downforce the center of gravity is 5 inches higher there are a lot of things that are promoting abuse to the tire and its just going to take us a while to sort it out
536284 i think if the lefts are working harder its going to help save the rights a little bit more yeah its going to bring the pace of the race up and then do you run into a new problem now that youre going faster and beating up the rights there are a lot of questions to be answered but i personally think having tires wear out is a good thing and we need to be wearing four out not just the right sides
536285 goodyear has to find a way to build a tire that we dont have to go through that process of having to lay rubber down on that particular racetrack to get where we can race on it
536286 they have to find a way to build a tire that will not wear out but when they do that whats going to happen is the complaints are going to start coming about the grip level of the tire thats what we had at charlotte thats what we had at atlanta if you go back and think about the last race in atlanta where everybody complained so loudly about the tire was the first time we havent had a tire problem in atlanta in a long time but everybody crawled up goodyears butt because the tires drove bad again its a difficult situation if you ask me if theyre going to error i rather them error on the side that the car is driving bad than error on the side of wearing them out but thats my opinion
536287 the technology that goodyear has access to and the technology that goodyear needs to develop needs to be more concentrated in my opinion on what they can do from a simulation standpoint from away from the racetrack standpoint because you can get so much more done there
536288 finding a way to build the tires correctly before they ever come to a test to me thats where the technology needs to be invested and thats where if were going to talk about doing tire testing thats more important than the actual testing itself as seen by me
536289 i dont know what the answer is all i know is that everyone gets the same time and as long as they are not blowing out im fine with it they can make it as hard as they want to
536290 personally i had no problem with the tire they brought in atlanta
536291 it seemed like last year we were going through a little phase where we were having all these hard tires and that was a lot of the complaining last year was that the tires were way too hard they were chattering and you cant race on them
536292 they have at least tried to work on that and have gotten a lot better to have excess tire wear is usually an odd thing to have and not a problem to have i think they were trying to work on it but i think as soon as they got it figured out the tire that they needed on the old car we switched to the new car and it wears on the tires even more now its something that they have to learn all over again and i think that part is taking longer
536293 this car is just so different than the car previous
536294 everybody has an opinion and i think that hurts nascar and it hurts goodyear from time to time they are trying to listen to all the input and every opinion that comes in at the end of the day they have to make the decisions
536295 a lot has changed in some ways i think a stable environment will allow goodyear to catch up and do what they need to do
536296 the 0 release was very limited and were now getting over that
536297 the range of platforms has expanded again where kde 4 0 was basically a linux only desktop for 4 1 were realizing the cross platform benefits that we had in mind for kde 4 so it runs on free software operating systems like freebsd and opensolaris and also on proprietary systems like mac os x and microsoft windows thats one of the reasons that it was important to get kde 4 0 out relatively early to mark a line in the sand and kick off the porting efforts for kde 4 i know both the freebsd and opensolaris kde communities had 4 1 in mind as a good target to make available on those platforms
536298 kde 4 1 is a significant release for the project because 4 0 was controversial for some with its architectural breaks and some quality issues
536299 in that respect this is the service pack 1 equivalent to a windows release while i havent installed it on my kubuntu instance yet 4 1 is generally getting positive reviews and seeing the kinds of reactions youd expect from a follow on update
536300 seeing the reactions to kde 4 0 has hammered home an important message to us as a whole i think its not 2003 anymore and the number of users willing to use linux and try new software has grown enormously
536301 the demographics of our users are different now the message of stick with kde 3 until kde 4 matures enough for you didnt get through loud enough kde 4 1 sends the message kde 4 is mature enough for early adopter desktop users and i think well be putting on the remaining polish to get it to casual users within the kde 4 1 lifespan of about six months
536302 something else that stands out to me and forgive me if it seems trivial but the hovering icons in the startup screen have now had their reflections adjusted to appear all in the same mirror earlier versions had reflections floating around in strange places
536303 a tiny graphical change like that stands out because in general kde 4 is so pretty to look at and so consistent i know theres plenty of grumbling about the looks all i can say is that i like them that a small mistake stands out like that id like to congratulate the artists on their attention to detail even in the face of tremendous work pressure
536304 in a piece i wrote a few years back i echoed marks belief that pretty is a feature obviously there must be substance behind the eye candy but apples ability to wow via its pretty ui is certainly instructive
536305 how those looks are achieved and with what technologies many hold up qt the framework upon which kde is built as the answer because its easier to design good looking applications with it than with gtk gimp tool kit its gnome counterpart but gnome is more popular with enterprises and has a lead in adoption there plus there are licensing issues so its a difficult question to answer
536306 for me on a free software operating system kde succeeds when it doesnt matter what os is underneath it just works regardless and were pretty darn close there

536332 in case of the continuation of a downward trend in oil price one of the serious discussions in the next opec meeting will be definitely the quotas
536333 opec as the responsible body to control the market should be more meticulous for the control of quotas
536334 the member countries that have increased their capacity should control it the issue is that some countries have been supplying more than their quota
536335 this is totally baseless the claim is rubbish there is no truth in this

536349 this new picture reveals that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known and underscores the challenges in confronting this disease
536350 these data which are based on new laboratory technology developed by cdc provide the clearest picture to date of the us hiv epidemic and unfortunately we are far from winning the battle against this preventable disease
536351 we as a nation have to come together to focus our efforts on expanding the prevention programs we know are effective
536352 while the level of hiv incidence is alarming stability in recent years suggests that prevention efforts are having an impact

536367 even if the leak this time is not dangerous i want that kind of accident to never happen
536368 despite everything i believe that people are really good at heart
536369 i could never have you over for dinner you would die if you saw the things i make
536370 just use the stupid nofollow tag and be done with it

536444 no court civilian or military has credibility when it listens to secret evidence in a closed courtroom
536445 is not ideal since it deprives the public of being able to make up its own mind about guilt or innocence
536446 it is to be expected given the nature of the proceedings
536447 its everybodys desire for the trials to be as open as possible
536448 it is my hope that the american public will someday hear mr hamdans defense
536449 her first words were she was very happy to see very nice people she was ecstatic
536450 in whichever negotiation we take part it is unequivocally with the view to the realization of irans nuclear right and the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights

536453 the americans have all along known about the isis collaboration with the taliban they knew the political leadership of the taliban including mullah omar were in quetta they knew when jalaluddin haqqani was in pakistan earlier it didnt suit their interest to admit this but now that the fellows trained to fight in kashmir are fighting in afghanistan and killing american soldiers theyre feeling the heat
536454 weve been shouting this from the rooftops for years now given the situation in afghanistan there is growing frustration within the u s about pakistans two timing but theres no telling whether this is a one off scolding or will translate into longer term action hopefully there will be more trouble for the isi ahead
536455 the fact that 56 000 americans each year are contracting hiv for the first time is a wake up call for all of us in the u s
536456 every year more than 15 000 people are dying from this disease and aids is a major killer for some of our minority communities
536457 the key thing we have to focus on now is what how and when do we begin to enhance the prevention responses to end this epidemic
536458 the hilles family has become a military force and members of the family have been attacking abducting and even killing people
536459 we must put an end to their attacks on innocent citizens

536464 and why should i put up with this so i flipped her off too
536465 i have three grandbabies this makes me feel unsafe to bring my grandkids here and i am about ready to put my house up for sale

536474 i would push resolution 125 which raised the tax for the first time in argentina since the advent of democracy we have seriously discussed a law that for the first time addressed redistribution of revenue

536491 dalam keluarga di antara tiga anak laki laki memang ariel lah yang paling dekat dengan ibu
536492 walau tak lagi tinggal di rumah ia pasti menelepon ibu paling tidak dua hari sekali

536506 im pleased with how our whole team did we came out here and competed really well
536507 all in all there were some good points the touchdown to keller was nice it showcased his abilities a little bit
536508 as im watching this game part of it is watching those guys but part of it is watching all the other new guys part of it is trying to look at the scheme and how those guys are executing the scheme theres a lot of new faces to look at thats really going to come more from the tape than this first look
536509 i just thought the group as a whole did what i was looking for them to do in terms of tempo and effort
536510 kellen put the ball right where it needed to be so there was no thinking or looking back after that
536511 im fine but im not at liberty to discuss injuries
536512 obviously the biggest reason they brought me here was to upgrade the pass rush so that is one of the things i have to get used to
536513 charlar sobre las cosas que han sucedido durante los siete meses de gesti n
536514 when you see these two gentleman im so happy to have them on the team i think theyre capable of taking us where we have to go

536516 i dont know if we have any involvement with favre
536517 i talk to mike four or five times a day its his decision it has to be his decision to run the personnel department i cant start picking out i want this and i want that
536518 i mean i dont go to any game that i dont feel im going to win never i may be overly optimistic even last year i thought we were going to win
536519 we had the opportunity to pick up what we considered to be very good talent and we thought if the talents there why not do it
536520 i think based on what we look like on paper im very optimistic
536521 im very confident that eric and mike and the staffs that theyve put together that theyre building a team both now and continuing to down the road
536522 we feel very strongly that our dna and where we came from is long island
536523 gives us an amazing competitive advantage compared to where we are right now
536524 when i bought the team i said i wanted to put a competitive team on the field and i wanted to move back to new york
536525 so we spent the first six years trying to do that it was a fabulous effort we left no stone unturned
536526 to woo your woman first push her into a duckpond then rescue her then let her babysit your kids even though you know nothing about her then get her mixed up in a peoples revolution then bring her home and dump her cos youre too much of an inverted snob to marry her then discover her dad and yours are best mates so consequently decide its perfectly ok to marry her after all then kiss her and youre done

536539 oil is the most fungible commodity on the planet that means that it doesnt matter where oil is drilled and it doesnt matter where it is sold its price will be determined by international markets if exxon drills for oil off of the florida coast they will sell that oil for the same price as oil of comparable quality from nigeria or venezuela or iran it dont make no difference where it comes from
536540 i dont want to be rigid as long as they rape the country and the constitution in a well thought out way i can compromise on that
536541 ill never budge on this even in the face of evidence that it is necessary
536542 its obvious that the mccain campaign and the rnc have decided to go after barack obama as a flip flopper whats equally obvious though that republicans couldnt have chosen a worse narrative

536544 overall i think a year from now we will have made a fair amount of progress if we stay the course
536545 we will win this conflict we will win it easily
536546 im committed to making sure that theres equal pay for equal work that is my record and you can count on it
536547 im going to be honest i know a lot less about economics than i do about military and foreign policy issues i still need to be educated

536628 if god stopped thinking about you you would stop existing there wouldnt be a
536629 for i know the plans i have for you declares the lord plans for peace and not for evil to give you a future and a hope
536630 for thus says the lord when seventy years are completed for babylon i will visit you and i will fulfill to you my promise and bring you back to this place
536631 daniel i believe you fail to see nations here because you bring the idea of individual election to the text with you and because you are expecting to find it there you do
536632 i told you and you do not believe the works that i do in my fathers name they bear witness of me
536633 for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvation to every one that believeth to the jew first and also to the greek
536634 behold i have made him a witness to the peoples a leader and commander for the peoples
536635 nation 6 seek the lord while he may be found call upon him while he is near
536636 nasb which we may note is exactly what paul says he preached as
536637 you yourselves know how i did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable and teaching you publicly and from house to house solemnly testifying to both jews and greeks of
536638 does god ever fail to follow through on his word
536639 and implied in that question is the notion that unless gods love serves to benefit a man
536640 i will be kind to you for a short time then i will give you what you deserve even though i could have provided a substitute and way of escape for you i dont think i will but i do love you
536641 now the poor man died and was carried away by the angels to abrahams bosom and the rich man also died and was buried

536643 which refers it seems to maggots feeding on flesh if the maggots never die the suggestion is that the flesh is never consumed
536644 and the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever they have no rest day and night those who worship the beast and his image and whoever receives the mark of his name
536645 i mean how can people who have been destroyed in a moment not have
536646 what kind of love doesnt make a way of escape for those he loves
536647 no one wants to be saved from sin but everyone wants to be saved from hell
536648 the only reason a person studies the original language is because he doesnt want to do what the text tells him to do in the english
536649 i think there are some therefore who are trained not to seek god first but to seek knowledge about god first and the premise i think is that when we can intellectually explain everything about god then we can begin to know him and that of course is a false premise we know god as we surrender to him and we surrender to him as we become satisfied in him and we become satisfied in him as he becomes satisfying to us in and through the his life giving bondage breaking word
536650 and on a wing of the temple he referring apparently to the he in previous verses who will confirm a covenant ie christ will set up an abomination that causes desolation until the end that is decreed is poured out on him

536715 the ioc co ordination commission and bocog met last night and agreed internet use will be just like in any olympics
536716 in the last few days its been obvious that there have been sites blocked on the internet
536717 i have received unqualified assurances from president of the ioc jacques rogge and the chairman of the co ordination commission hein verbruggen that we have not shifted our position
536718 already we put a team together in the ioc to work with bocog to begin to open up sites which we believe are absolutely necessary to comply with non censored reporting of the games
536719 we are in the process of getting websites which were previously blocked unblocked
536720 there will be sites blocked that have to do with pornography or where in the opinion of the national government are sites which are subversive or against national interest and thats normal in most countries in the world
536721 still countries like people behave dangerously when their moods turn dark if america fails to distinguish between what it needs to change and what it needs to accept it risks hurting not just allies and trading partners but also itself
536722 everybody goes through bad times some learn from the problems they have caused themselves and come back stronger some blame others lash out and damage themselves further america has had the wisdom to take the first course many times before lets hope it does so again
536723 we believe the answer is no they wont lower prices a penny
536724 the reason is what weve said all along that the main driver in higher food prices is high oil prices
536725 that means it takes 21 cents of diesel per box to get it to the store yet the value of corn in that box is less than 7 cents
536726 so its pretty easy to see how fuel and energy costs impact food price
536727 many of gmas members are enjoying bigger profits this year because they are raising prices but placing the blame for those prices on the back of american farmers
536728 its a classic blame shifting tactic its a charade but its one they can only keep up if corn prices are rising
536729 corn growers are working hard to produce this years crop he said and nebraskas corn crop is in very good condition overall

536740 for the hebrews gave us our moral categories the greeks have given us our philosophical categoies the romans have passed on to us our legal categories
536741 for the hebrew the great pursuit of life was symbolized by
536742 writing to the believers in corinth that embodied all these influences the apostle paul wrote
536743 this verse captures every longing and ideal in the face of jesus christ gods holiness transcended hebrew morality gods omniscience transcended greeces quest for knowing and gods sovereignty transcended any roman glory all were ultimately shown to us in a face
536744 the really inconvenient truths seven environmental catastrophes liberals dont want you to know about because they helped cause them
536745 why dont we have more outcries about hormones and campaigns to save the fish populations why arent environmentalists lobbying on capitol hill to keep these chemicals from being dumped into our rivers
536746 maybe because the source of these chemicals is not some corporate polluter but something a little more dear to the left human birth control pills morning after pills and abortion pills

536753 no comment on anything related to the vice presidential issue
536754 very important that the fbi present their case against bruce and not just state that the investigation was over because it was him and hes gone
536755 im concerned about what closing this case without conclusive evidence might do to harm our life sciences enterprise i think we as americans need to see the proof
536756 its a shame the man is not here with us we might have known more
536757 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure

536759 since i plan to speak with prime minister singh president hu jintao and already did so with bush we will see if it is possible to return to the negotiating table

536770 this saturday morning i was watching cnn and even if i dont understand english that well i saw that something strange was going on
536771 it is sincerely bad that some media reports preceded the governments announcement
536772 if the foreign ministry received communication from the us government then it should either report to the prime ministers office or make a public announcement
536773 i think it is extremely regrettable that the information was delayed
536774 even if it was a very minor leak we would like to have a firm grasp of the information we want to explain to local citizens consistently
536775 even if the leak this time is not dangerous i want that kind of accident to never happen
536776 residents want to know that kind of information immediately so i really dont understand why authorities need to hide it
536777 in case of the continuation of a downward trend in oil price one of the serious discussions in the next opec meeting will be definitely the quotas
536778 opec as the responsible body to control the market should be more meticulous for the control of quotas
536779 the member countries that have increased their capacity should control it the issue is that some countries have been supplying more than their quota

536790 tim spent his life traveling and meeting new people and always saw the good in everyone he had the most infectious giggle you could hear him laughing a mile away
536791 it didnt matter what kind of a day you were having because when you heard him laugh you couldnt help but join in
536792 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
536793 as far as the mark spitz thing goes ive said this before and ill say it again
536794 i want to be the first michael phelps and not the second mark spitz
536795 i dont mean to downplay his accomplishments by any means for what he did it was and still is the greatest olympic performance of all time
536796 he will always be remembered as one of the great olympians of all time im just lucky that i can be in a position to hopefully do something different to him

536808 with a fair amount of speed either in a video and or written statement
536809 were burmese but we live here we have no food and water here but its still better than how we are treated in burma
536810 it doesnt mean the end of the problem there will still be problems
536811 most of the children are malnourished they have no land to cultivate and legally they are not allowed to work so it makes it difficult for them
536812 they dont want to go back to burma even though they are not enjoying their living conditions in bangladesh
536813 we were tortured in burma our mosque was attacked we had no security for our lives we are better off here
536814 we are suffering in both places but the suffering is different on that side of the border we lived in fear of the military but in bangladesh the suffering is different food and shelter is the problem
536815 life is bad for us here but at least we can get married we can move here and there we dont want to go back to burma we cant go back
536816 its certain that all the personnel and all the equipment will be sent away from here
536817 we tried to look for ideas in every choice that we make in our homes hoping that everyone who goes through it will be inspired to make some change on some level
536818 some people will walk away and want to do an entire new home or some people will think when they go for their towels next and go for organic linens
536819 it is happening but the industry needs to do a better job of getting information into peoples hands when theyre looking for it
536820 i like not making a negative impact on the earth
536821 its got so much to be said for it because it uses nature and natural materials
536822 its open you bring the outside in and you can even bring the inside out its a house built for humans its plausible in real life
536823 the impression that green building has to be modern weird solar ugly
536824 one of the things thats fundamental to green building is that it can look like anything it can be a regular craftsman house or a cape cod house in new england or an adobe house in santa fe you dont have to change what the home looks like to make it green
536825 but we hope people will make informed decisions when theyre building when theyre renovating
536826 once i can see in real time how my behavior translates to my usage i can make changes
536827 if youre very clever if youre a do it yourself kind of person you can do one room at a time and achieve your ultimate goal
536828 non si suona per riempirsi la vita si vive per riempire i propri dischi
536829 we dont want to get involved in another situation like university corners
536830 because of that precedent the planning staff has been a little more attuned to making sure that we let folks in the development community know that we dont want to see a site deteriorate because nothings happening there
536831 weve started asking the question about the capital basis about some of the folks proposing projects
536832 we dont go to the point of asking for financial disclosures
536833 but when we have signature developments proposed in or around downtown we at least raise those issues
536834 frankly if someone gets an approval for a building order or permit and theyre operating within the legal framework of what they can do there theres not too much precedent for city to start taking action against property owners
536835 we dont have many tools available to us in that regard
536836 it is possible to regulate these things especially if you have some funding
536837 but enforcement of those things is a tough issue when the owner doesnt have the money or inclination to spend money to maintain them it requires a lot of involvement and energy to correct the problem the reason those things happen is economic and whats really needed to fix them is economic
536838 i suspect a great deal of it has to do with economics
536839 i imagine that a property owners preference would be to keep their building looking good for whatever reason if thats not happening we get involved in the best case scenario we get it fixed up and returned to the housing stock in the worst case scenario we end up doing a demolition
536840 certainly there are code violations out there that we just dont know about yet
536841 those numbers tell a story that even though the city commission has been really generous in allocating money to this program were barely treading water in keeping up with demand
536842 if weve got a property with substantial value and there are clear titles laying out who owns it most issues can be resolved in a couple weeks
536843 if there are things going on in the background like somebody passing away and leaving the title to their heirs it can become fairly involved typically before we actually demolish a building the file for that property is one or two inches thick

536873 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deeds who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat

537032 our findings along with those from the wisconsin cohort remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease

537095 throughabouts have been used in other parts of the country as an effective way of keeping traffic moving at busy junctions

537103 the level of engineering and skill that has gone into building this brings back some of the old skills that originated in darlington
537104 darlington has always been on the map as a railway town with the first passenger railway and a lot of steam trains built here
537105 the revitalisation of this will lift darlington in the esteem of a lot of railway enthusiasts

537125 our grandfather thought frank was a point of connection a bridge if you will to the larger african american experience for my brother
537126 frank was part of a group of black vanguard intellectuals
537127 the people that he came into contact with throughout his life like richard wright and margaret walker were very significant
537128 you could get a lot of strength from a person like frank who had suffered all the discrimination that a black man goes through in america
537129 mccarthy era strategy of smear tactics and condemnation by association
537130 writings of frank marshall davis a voice of the black press
537131 he made his vision into a beacon a light shedding understanding and enlightenment on the problems that denied people regardless of race national origin or economic status their constitutional rights
537132 with his books and whiskey breath and the hint of hard earned knowledge behind the hooded eyes
537133 it made me smile thinking back on frank and his old black power dashiki self
537134 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
537135 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did

537137 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
537138 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
537139 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
537140 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
537141 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
537142 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
537143 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
537144 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
537145 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
537146 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
537147 the exciting part of this study is that we have discovered a completely new process that regulates the adverse responses to bad memories
537148 these findings can help the development of new drugs to treat conditions in which people are haunted by persistent fears such as posttraumatic stress disorder or other panic disorders
537149 this large epidemiologic study shows for the first time a consistent and robust association between a high blood level of alkaline phosphatase and cardiovascular death in thousands of dialysis patients across the united states
537150 if the association between alkaline phosphatase and mortality has a causal link treatment strategies that reduce alkaline phosphatase levels may improve survival in patients with ckd and probably in many other patients with chronic diseases and active bone disorders
537151 in dialysis patients increased levels of alkaline phosphatase in the blood indicate a so called high turnover bone disease which can happen due to hormonal imbalance in ckd
537152 alkaline phosphatase has recently been shown to be associated with increased vascular calcification in experimental studies
537153 our study shows the clinical manifestations of this association in real world patients
537154 for the ultimate proof of causation treatment trials are needed to target high bone turnover diseases to reduce serum alkaline phosphatase effectively and then to ascertain whether these interventions can improve survival

537157 graphene is a great material for electronics but it would be even better if it were possible to create devices with crystallographic edges that is edges where the atoms lie along single lines in the graphene plane
537158 standard etching techniques being used in the semiconductor industry do not allow this sort of fabrication instead they produce rough edges with lots of atomic scale defects that limit the performance of the fabricated devices
537159 on the whole our findings suggest that marriage is a better predictor of parenting quality with regard to social fathers than biological fathers
537160 our study is relevant to understanding the quality of parental care that children receive from resident fathers across a range of family configurations that are now commonly experienced by children
537161 iron is the single most important micronutrient bacteria need to survive
537162 understanding how these bacteria thrive within us is a critical element of learning how to defeat them
537163 its amazing that the bacteria could learn to extract iron from their environment in this way
537164 we went into these experiments with no idea that this mechanism existed but then bacteria have to be creative to survive in some very hostile environments and theyve had maybe 3 5 billion years to figure it out
537165 tb bacteria have access to an abundant supply of iron citrate flowing through the lungs in the blood
537166 finding a way to sneak iron from humans at no energy cost to the bacteria is as good as it gets our discovery may enable others to figure out a way to limit tbs access to iron citrate making the bacteria more vulnerable to drug treatment
537167 its certain that all the personnel and all the equipment will be sent away from here

537219 climate change will have a big impact over the next five decades
537220 our woods will change many species will cope with some warming but there is uncertainty about what happens with extreme events such as droughts and storms which we expect to become more frequent
537221 what is of concern is how the old trees will be replaced younger ones are not doing well whether they reach maturity remains to be seen trees less than 50 years old are showing changes that we would not expect to see until they were about 140

537244 i ate a slice of watermelon then worked up the enthusiasm to walk to the bus stop
537245 turning from my page which rest upon my lap i could feel within me a brewing vileness a sickly compulsion driven forward by demons and phantoms these words i had concocted the sentences i had cobbled together in a flowing scrawl were as translucent as the emptiness which surrounded me every letter which preceded letter was now history and non existent each word that i brought forth became meaningless after i had wrote it it seemed to me that the only meaning that any word or any letter has comes from the words and letters that follow it so that the full meaning of what it is i do can only come forward by the last piece i shall ever write that every paper sentence word and letter are given meaning upon my death for it is in death that i will finish my masterpiece
537246 i found myself totally confounded by that which i so deeply had become betrothed to it was the questions which seemed to me not really questions more as abysmal ascetic blotches that tore at me they marked the canvas of my existence i sought to make them beautiful again that all i do is to make not only my world a masterpiece of wondrous beauty but also to show others such flowers everything that exists derives its meaning from within it takes but a kindly saintly heart to beckon it out to play what i do is its own meaning
537247 it seems to me that these questions which defy analysis are nether a result of lost meaning nor frightened children in need of nurturance that all answers lay within meaning by cause and effect since this relation is the result of assumptions based on my own world view i may only make my world understandable by a careful analysis of myself and my environment others may be broken down and understood for all effects have a cause meaning is derived by its application
537248 am i to understand that you are asking me to guide you oh that the sweet angel the virginal saint seeking guidance in the dark hallway from the dark brother forgive me if i find a deep mirthful joy in this whole scene that you stand so above everyone my girl my sweet girl wont sully the frills of her dress with the filth of my world yet here she is as if the lord himself were to give me a diamond in the darkness

537379 bukanlah menghadapkan wajahmu ke arah timur dan barat itu suatu kebaktian akan tetapi sesungguhnya kebaktian orang yang beriman kepada allah hari kemudian malaikat malaikat kitab kitab nabi nabi dan memberikan harta yang dicintainya kepada kerabatnya anak anak yatim orang orang miskin musafir yang memerlukan pertolongan dan memerdekakan hamba sahaya mendirikan salat dan menunaikan zakat dan orang yang orang orang yang menepati janjinya apabila ia berjanji dan orang orang yang sabar dalam kesempitan penderitaan dan dalam peperangan mereka itulah orang orang yang benar imannya dan mereka itulah orang orang yang bertakwa
537380 wahai ibnu masud nasihatilah aku dengan sesuatu yang dapat meredakan kegelisahan hatiku buat masa ini jiwaku tidak tenteram fikiranku kusut tidurku tidak nyenyak dan seleraku hilang
537381 dalam 60 000 orang di dunia di zaman ini tiada seorang pun yang matinya di dalam keadaan beriman isteri isteri tidak lagi mendengar kata kata suami ramai yang tidak berzakat dan tidak lagi membuat kebajikan oleh itu sheikh ahmad hendaklah kamu menyedarkan orang orang ini supaya membuat kebajikan kerana hari penghabisan kiamat akan tiba yang mana semua bintang bintang akan terbit dari langit sesudah itu pintu taubat akan tertutup tulisan di dalam al quran akan hilang dan matahari turun dekat di atas kepala
537382 melakukan syirik dan tidak mustahil jatuh murtad melainkan dia bertaubat dan menarik balik perbuatannya itu terhadap sesiapa yang telahpun dikirimkan risalah ini
537383 termasuk dalam menyekutukan allah s w t dengan syirik yang amat besar shirk i kubra serta mempermainkan rasulullah s a w serta menyebar dengan niat tidak baik kekeliruan dan muslihat di kalangan umat islam
537384 paling kurang menimbulkan syirik kecil dan murtad secara tidak sengaja terkeluar dari islam serta syirik yang besar jika sengaja maka taubatnya tidak sah melainkan dibuat dengan sesungguhnya adapun jika seseorang itu menyalin surat ini kepada umat islam lain jatuhlah hukum ke atasnya mentablighkan perkara syirik dan khurafat sesungguhnya ulamak sependapat perbuatan itu sungguh besar syiriknya dan boleh mengakibatkan murtad walaupun tanpa sadar si pengirim
537385 hari ini aku sempurnakan bagimu agama kamu islam dan aku sempurnakan ke atasmu nikmat ku serta aku reda islam sebagai agama kamu
537386 orang yang paling merasa bahagia dengan syafaatku di hari kiamat adalah orang yang mengatakan
537387 hai nabi katakanlah kepada isteri isterimu anak anak perempuanmu dan isteri isteri orang mumin semua hendaklah mereka melabuhkan jilbab jilbab mereka atas muka muka mereka yang demikian itu lebih memastikan mereka agar dikenali sebagai wanita islam supaya mereka tidak diganggu
537388 sebahagian perempuan jahiliah apabila keluar rumah mereka suka menampakkan sebahagian kecantikannya misalnya dada leher dan rambut sehingga mereka ini diganggu oleh laki laki fasik jahat dan yang suka berzina kemudian turunlah ayat di atas yang memerintahkan kepada orang orang perempuan islam untuk melabuhkan jilbabnya itu sehingga semua bahagian bahagian tubuhnya yang boleh membawa fitnah itu tidak kelihatan
537389 eleh tetapi hari ini ramai juga wanita bertudung yang kena rogol malah setengahnya kena bunuh dijerut dengan tudungnya pulak kanak kanak pun kena rogol dan bunuh
537390 biasanya bila seseorang itu sedang marah sempat tak agaknya ia berfikir bahaya atau tidak tindakan yang dibuatnya sebagai contoh ada orang yang sedang marah kerana bising tangisan kanak kanak maka ditendang seperti berita yang dikeluarkan olehakhbar baru baru ini ditolak jatuh tangga ditekup wajah kanak kanak itu dengan bantal dan macam macam lagi bagi menghilangkan kemarahan atau gangguan bising itu setelah beberapa ketika mungkin baru seolah olah dia tersedar lalu cemas dan mungkin menyesal
537391 demikianlah juga nafsu jahat bila ia berada di tahap tinggi ia tidak lagi melihat samada kepada pakaian dan umur wanita mahupun isteri orang dihadapannya sasarannya hanya mendapatkan hajat jahatnya kerana itulah wanita yang menutup aurat dengan sempurna serta kanak kanak perempuan juga terancam tanpa dapat dinafikan juga peranan vcd laman web akhbar majalah dan novel lucah
537392 tapi macam mana pulak ayat tadi kata tutup aurat dapat mengelakkan wanita dari disakiti
537393 jika kita lihat dengan teliti ayat tadi sebenarnya ditujukan kepada seluruh kaum wanita ini bermaksud jika sebahagian besar wanita tidak mentaatinya dan memakai pakaian seksi pula di ketika itu faedah dan kebaikan dari tutup aurat bagi menjaga semua kaum wanita dari disakiti secara umum akan tergugat dari mencapai matlamat umumnya sebenarnya ayat itu nak beritahu bahawa seluruh wanita bertanggung jawab menjaga keselamatan kaum sejenisnya dengan menjaga aurat masing masing
537394 maka bila ada yang seksi ini bermakna ia sedang mengancam kaum sejenis anda yang lain dan di tempat lain kerana telah menghidupkan nafsu kebinatangan lelaki jahat yang sedang tidur
537395 dihiaskan diuji bagi manusia itu nafsu syahwat dan keinginan serta kecintaan kepada wanita anak anak harta
537396 tidak aku tinggalkan fitnah selepasku yang lebih boleh membawa mudarat kepada lelaki selain wanita
537397 dari jarir bin abdullah ia berkata saya bertanya kepada rasulullah s a w tentang melihat aurat wanita secara tiba tiba tanpa sengaja maka jawab nabi palingkanlah pandanganmu itu
537398 riwayat al bukhari bab hifdz al lisan 11 256 no 298
537399 hendaknya mereka itu melabuhkan tudungnya sampai ke dadanya dan jangan kamu mendedahkan aurat dan perhiasan kamu kecuali apa yang terzahir
537400 dan hendaknya mereka itu tidak menampak nampakkan aurat dan perhiasannya kecuali terhadap suami atau ayahnya
537401 ada dua golongan dari ahli neraka yang belum pernah saya lihat keduanya itu l kaum yang membawa cambuk seperti ekor sapi yang mereka pakai buat memukul orang penguasa yang kejam 2 perempuan perempuan yang berpakaian tetapi telanjang yang cenderung kepada perbuatan maksiat dan mencenderungkan orang lain kepada perbuatan maksiat rambutnya sebesar punuk unta mereka ini tidak akan boleh masuk syurga serta tidak dapat akan mencium bau syurga padahal bau syurga itu tercium sejauh perjalanan demikian dan demikian
537402 hai asma sesungguhnya seorang perempuan apabila sudah haidh cukup umurnya tidak patut diperlihatkan tubuhnya itu melainkan ini dan ini sambil ia menunjuk muka dan dua tapak tangannya
537403 janganlah perempuan perempuan itu berlaku lemah dengan perkataannya sebab akan menaruh harapan orang yang dalam hatinya ada penyakit
537404 maka syaitan membisikkan fikiran jahat kepada keduanya untuk menampakkan kepada keduanya yang tertutup dari mereka iaitu auratnya
537405 26 amat jelas dari ayat ini penutupan aurat ditujukan kepada sesiapa sahaja yang termasuk dalam kategori anak adam iaitu manusia justeru barangsiapa yang berpaling dari arahan ini secara langsung ia menjatuhkan tahapnya selari dengan binatang yang tiada cukup kemampuan dan aqal bagi menjalankan arahan penutupan aurat b agar kaum wanita tidak disakiti ia berdasarkan ulasan yang telah dibuat sebelum ini bersandarkan firman allah swt dari surah al ahzab ayat 59 c tanda atau seperti uniform kepada penganut agama islam ia juga boleh difahami dari surah azhab ayat 59 tadi apabila allah swt menyebut yang demikian itu lebih memastikan mereka agar dikenali sebagai wanita islam dari sini jelas menunjukkan salah satu fungsi tutupan aurat juga adalah sebagai syiar diri sebagai penganut islam firman allah barangsiapa yang membesarkan syiar allah maka ia adalah dari tanda ketaqwaan hati d tanda profesionalism dalam sistem pemakaian islam kita dapat memerhati bagaimana trend sesebuah organisasi atau restoran hebat hari ini pasti meletakkan dress code tertentu bagi kakitangannya dan para tetamunya ia pastinya bertujuan penjagaan standard khas bagi organisasi dan restoran itu di tahap tertentu sebagai contoh kita tidak akan dapat melihat individu berselipar jepun di sebuah persidangan antarabangsa di picc putrajaya mahupun di kalangan kakitangan petronas di pejabat mereka di menara berkembar semua menjaga standard berbanding tauke kedai runcit yang tidak beruniform justeru islam adalah satu agama dan cara hidup yang profesional pastinya begitu lengkap menyediakan panduan melengkapi setiap sudut kehidupan manusia dari hal hal yang sulit seperti urusan di dalam tandas hinggalah ekonomi dan kenegaraan walaupun demikian islam tidak mengarah umatnya membuat perkara yang tidak rasional justeru sudah tentu standard pemakaian yang diletakkan ini tidak membebankan bahkan ia amat bertepatan dengan logik aqal manusia yang sihat e sebagai ujian bagi manusia untuk melihat tahap ketaatan mereka kepada allah swt maka hal ini amat jelas dari firman allah ertinya dijadikan hidup dan mati adalah untuk menguji siapakah yang terlebih baik amalannya
537406 orang wanita bertudung pun banyak yang jahat hari ini berzina khalwat dan macam macam lagi
537407 malah kami juga baik kami tak kacau orang tak mengumpat dan buat benda benda tak elok
537408 sesungguhnya allah tidak melihat kepada tubuh rupa luaran dan harta kamu tetapi melihat kepada hati dan amalan kamu
537409 seorang pekerja yang dijumpai oleh majikannya sedang bermain game semasa waktu kerjanya sedangkan dokumen yang dipinta si boss masih tidak disiapkan lalu si majikan berkata
537410 saya luaran je nampak main game boss tapi hati saya ikhlas dan saya kerja dengan cemerlang
537411 ketahuilah bahawa di dalam diri anak adam itu ada seketul daging yang bila ianya baik maka baik seseorang itu dan apabila buruk buruklah amalan seseorang itu ketahuilah ia adalah hati
537412 riwayat abu daud tirmidzi dan lain lain rujuk naylul awtar 8 632 no 3920 hadith ini dengan jelas menunjukkan seorang hakim dalam islam akan membuat hukum berdasarkan info dan bukti zahir yang diberikan demikian juga dalam kes penutupan aurat tanpa menutupnya adalah tanda keingkaran hati terhadap arahan allah mana mungkin hati begini boleh dianggap baik oleh islam kaum wanita perlu menyedari bahawa dengan pembukaan auratnya setiap lelaki yang melihatnya akan memperoleh dosa setiap kali ia memandang tetapi yang beratnya adalah si wanita bukan mendapat satu dosa bagi kesalahan itu tetapi juga meraih setiap dosa semua lelaki yang memandangnya bayangkanlah berapa banyak dosa yang diperolehi hanya dengan pembukaan aurat di satu hari ia berdasarkan sabda nabi saw ertinya sesiapa yang mempelopori sesuatu yang buruk maka ke atasnya dosa dan dosa setiap orang yang membuatnya tanpa sedikit kurang pun dosanya
537413 played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
537414 so nobody really thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
537415 you know hes obama not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
537416 weve made progress when the worst thing you can say about a black man is that hes elitist
537417 what we mean by patriotism is a sense of national responsibility a patriotism which is not short frenzied outbursts of emotion but the tranquil and steady dedication of a lifetime
537418 nixon was as good a poker player as if not better than anyone we had ever seen

537423 mccain spokesman brian rogers said the campaign would have no comment on anything related to the vice presidential issue
537424 there just arent gender differences anymore in math performance though
537425 boys did a teeny bit better in some states and girls did a teeny bit better in others
537426 but when you average them all you essentially get no difference
537427 but we need to motivate teachers to do so by including those items on the tests
537428 so youre dipping farther down into the distribution of female talent which brings down the average score
537429 that may be the explanation for the results rather than girls arent as good as math
537430 because if your mom or your teacher thinks you cant do math that can have a big impact on your math self concept
537431 but as a scientist i have to challenge them with data
537432 the fact that 56 000 americans each year are contracting hiv for the first time is a wake up call for all of us in the u s
537433 every year more than 15 000 people are dying from this disease and aids is a major killer for some of our minority communities
537434 the key thing we have to focus on now is what how and when do we begin to enhance the prevention responses to end this epidemic
537435 no comment on anything related to the vice presidential issue
537436 living out here you think youre safe but when you have hay you have to be wise to it

537441 you are probably going to run 25 to 30 degrees above whatever the temperature is just standing out here in bunker gear
537442 once you get into a super heated environment 800 900 degrees easily especially as you start getting into the attic space the ambient body temperature lets put it like this when these guys come out on a 100 degree day and pull their coats off steam comes off their body like stem coming off cold water

537445 dicono che possono prelevare tutte le informazioni nel laptop di un viaggiatore senza avere alcuna prova che questi sta infrangendo la legge ed inoltre prosegue nojeim la polizia non stabilisce alcun criterio per stabilire quale computer deve essere esaminato
537446 i dati contenuti nei computer che possono comprendere materiali sulla jihad o pedopornografia ed altro ancora
537447 con le attuali leggi americane agenti governativi possono sequestrare e analizzare il computer portatile di un viaggiatore i suoi dischi e altri media elettronici quando arriva negli stati uniti da un volo internazionale o parte dagli stati uniti verso un altro paese
537448 la notizia secondo cui i funzionari governativi americani hanno il diritto di esaminare e scaricare i contenuti di un portatile o persino sequestrare i computer business dei viaggiatori accusa il direttore esecutivo di acte susan gurley una sorpresa per la maggioranza dei nostri soci fin qui si sempre pensato al diritto alla privacy per il computer personale ma ora si apprende che di privacy non ce n alcuna
537449 non hanno alcun bisogno di un motivo plausibile per effettuare queste perquisizioni stando alla legge attuale lo possono fare anche in assenza di sospetti e anche senza rivelare i motivi per cui lo fanno
537450 il problema cosa succede alle informazioni proprietarie business che possono trovarsi su un portatile quei dati vengono copiati vengono restituiti comprendiamo che il governo americano voglia proteggere i propri confini ma vogliamo avere informazioni trasparenti in modo tale che i viaggiatori daffari sappiano come comportarsi dovrebbero lasciare a casa le informazioni pi importanti

537460 to let over 430 seats in iits go vacant is a criminal waste of infrastructure such as faculty and physical facilities
537461 there is no time this year but we may try to seek permission to transfer the vacant seats to the general category for next year
537462 every iit seat has the potential to produce a nandan nilekani or a vinod khosla
537463 to allow even one seat to go vacant is like crushing a million dreams and aspirations
537464 unthinking way in which the hrd ministry merrily commissioned half a dozen new institutes and expanded quota seats without so much as a thought as to whether or not reserved candidates would qualify
537465 he kept his bulky hand on my shoulder and asked me professor yeh kya kar diya
537466 i promise to post immediately and every day from the conference and send you pictures of me standing on my head as i do this
537467 we are helpless we did not want this despite our repeated requests the state did nothing to raise our stipend that is ridiculously low even in comparison with bihar jharkhand and orissa we will not work till the government gives us a raise
537468 in jharkhand a post graduate trainee gets around rs 15 000 and we get rs 8 250
537469 we will hold a meeting on monday and decide whether to join the agitation
537470 the stipend for the junior doctors here is ridiculous the agitation is justified
537471 we admit that the stipend should be hiked but the health department has taken concrete steps so this cease work cannot be supported
537472 we have already set up a three member committee to review the stipend structure which will give us its recommendations from september the stipend would be raised we have conveyed this to all hospitals
537473 every time a prepaid slip is issued to a passenger the taxi number passenger name and destination are recorded the driver has to come back to collect the money so the service is safe
537474 we filed a complaint against them with the traffic police last week we can take guarantee of our drivers but what autos and the other unauthorised people who threaten our men nobody wants to pick up fight with policemen
537475 there should be a system where the complaint number or an address for feedback is given inside the cab at present if one wants to complain there is no mechanism for the same
537476 the iranian nation will not give up a single iota of its nuclear rights
537477 its a shame that iran does not take us up on our generous incentives package
537478 a clear signal for a mutual freeze we would freeze our sanctions efforts and iran the development of its centrifuges
537479 seriously seeking to increase the size of joint investments to more than us 3 billion over the next years
537480 the lads are distraught as they have thrown everything at them but i am more gutted than anyone because i fully expected us to win today its the first time i have ever lost back to back games and certainly midway through the day i expected us to bowl them out for 200 and win quite comfortably but weve just witnessed a very special innings from graeme smith and he deserves all the plaudits hes going to get
537481 absolutely none but i am not scoring runs as a no 3 batsmen i have got to score runs and in this series what have i got i have had some good balls and a little bit of bad luck but i set myself a lot of high standards and in this series so far i have not got anywhere near those standards i want to look at that and make sure i get back to playing like i can
537482 emotions always run high after defeats like this so well let the dust settle from today and try to work out where we are
537483 we are not playing the level of cricket which i would like
537484 i cant fault any of the efforts from any of the players they are giving it absolutely everything but we are just not playing well enough as a unit or as well as we can that has to be looked at
537485 i think a captain feels a little less pressure when hes performing well
537486 there are times when ive struggled and the pressure on yourself as leader to ask a lot of your players all the time when youre not performing well is a big thing
537487 its about being consistent when youre not doing well and you have to dig deep
537488 ive had my tough moments but now this year ive had a great year it does help to score runs because it takes pressure off you
537489 i am an experienced player and at the minute i am not delivering so i will have to come up with a formula to give myself the best chance to deliver when the pressure is on ive done it before and im sure ill do it again
537490 im prepared to do anything to benefit the team but ive got to get back to playing well and get back to the standard ive set myself at the minute im not at that standard
537491 im not at liberty to discuss the nature of the charges
537492 terrorism continues to rear its ugly head in our region it remains the single biggest threat to our stability and to our progress
537493 intensifying market conditions geographical challenges and communication cost have become some of the major drivers of ip telephony deployment within asia pacific
537494 both small and medium businesses smb and large businesses lb across verticals are resorting to the deployment of ip telephony to reduce communication cost and increase their workforce production
537495 businesses have now started to view the technology not only in terms of cost saving in communication but also from the standpoint of the strategic value it delivers to their operations
537496 ip telephony is not confined within the realm of communication alone but offers scope for integration with other software applications and hardware to achieve productive outcomes
537497 this report is modified at the time of ordering and requires 3 5 days to deliver
537498 unlike a district prosecutor he picks and chooses his cases this makes his activities intrinsically political where many crimes have been committed such as darfur or the democratic republic of congo who is to be investigated how to balance between the low level perpetrators and the commanders how to balance between the different sides of a conflict how to choose between the different kinds of crime committed murder rape torture recruitment of child soldiers given the limited resources of the icc these are almost impossible choices and indeed why should it be the task of a prosecutor to make such delicate political judgements
537499 the united states felt it was time to stand up on this point of moral clarity
537500 we also wish to stress that no one is more impacted by and concerned with the problems of darfur than the government and the people of sudan we are pleased to see the international communitys respect for the sovereignty independence and territorial integrity of sudan bolstered by the tangible measure of the resolution adopted by this council

537514 litalia che si avvicina con tante speranze alle olimpiadi ha gi conquistato questo successo testimonianza che la passione dei nostri piloti sta dando risultati straordinari il volo libero non affatto una disciplina estrema ma si svolge in condizioni di assoluta sicurezza a contatto con la natura non per persone in cerca di emozioni forti ma semplicemente dedicata a chi guarda al volo come una ricerca di simbiosi con lambiente mi auguro che in futuro il numero di appassionati cresca ancora anche e soprattutto in difesa dei pi veri e genuini valori sportivi
537515 ce un disegno di legge che colpisce con pene sufficientemente gravi

537525 once again the earth has become wicked and over populated and i see the end of all flesh before me
537526 you have 6 months to build the ark before i will start the unending rain for 40 days and 40 nights
537527 im about to start the rain where is the ark
537528 i needed a building permit ive been arguing with the inspector about the need for a sprinkler system
537529 my neighbors claim that ive violated the neighborhood zoning laws by building the ark in my yard and exceeding the height limitations we had to go to the development appeal board for a decision
537530 then the department of transportation demanded a bond be posted for the future costs of moving power lines and other overhead obstructions to clear the passage for the arks move to the sea i told them that the sea would be coming to us but they would hear nothing of it
537531 getting the wood was another problem theres a ban on cutting local trees in order to save the spotted owl i tried to convince the environmentalists that i needed the wood to save the owls but no go
537532 when i started gathering the animals an animal rights group sued me they insisted that i was confining wild animals against their will they argued the accommodations were too restrictive and it was cruel and inhumane to put so many animals in a confined space
537533 then the epa ruled that i couldnt build the ark until theyd conducted an environmental impact study on your proposed flood
537534 im still trying to resolve a complaint with the human rights commission on how many minorities im supposed to hire for my building crew
537535 immigration and naturalization are checking the green card status of most of the people who want to work
537536 the trades unions say i cant use my sons they insist i have to hire only union workers with ark building experience
537537 to make matters worse the irs seized all my assets claiming im trying to leave the country illegally with endangered species
537538 so forgive me lord but it would take at least 10 years for me to finish this ark

537542 i miei lavori scrive lartista sono racconti del mondo racconti che passano da superficie a superficie da forma a forma in un infinito numero di variazioni dello stesso racconto ogni opera conclusa e ha in s una possibilit di lettura complessa polisemica cos organizzata cos legata nelle sue diverse parti da non poter essere pi modificata pena il rischio di cambiarne completamente lequilibrio semantico e formale
537543 sculture polimateriche che come scrive nella presentazione in catalogo giovanni tesio suggeriscono i sottili passaggi non sai se di barche che diventano arpe o se di arpe che diventano barche ma anche di barche che sembrano prendere il volo come le rondini
537544 un tondo che saccompagna ai frammenti di una barca spezzata un tondo tagliato a mezzo da una linea ondulata vagamente tao che congiunge pi di quanto non sembri separare una geografia di terra e di cielo di lontani evi e di peregrinazioni cosmiche nella sospensione del tempo un silenzio dassoluto che sembra liberare la grazia dei respiri nel fiato dei mondi possibili il viaggio di un relitto che richiama la presenza dellintero immagine di una navigazione antica quella barca spezzata non sta l come un gesto di impotenza ma come la memoria di unavventura rinnovabile come la radice feconda di un nuovo paesaggio mentale di una mai spenta illusione
537545 on the one hand there is still a lot to do but i think we should also be gratified that we see so many volunteers and neighbors helping neighbors
537546 you see the picture of it but they dont show the damage at the level that it is
537547 one of the first duties of any government is to ensure that the lights stay on and the wheels keep turning
537548 it is no exaggeration to say that energy is as important as the armed forces or the police without one you cant deploy the others
537549 to come up with the best policies for the uk and its future security
537550 the conservatives who have finally ditched their naive view of nuclear power as a last resort should start publicly championing new nuclear generation both for its green credentials and as the only way to stop the lights going out
537551 by singing in harmony from the same page of the same investing hymnal the diehards drown out market noise

537553 man im having a good time out here playing football

537556 coaches take care of us make sure were doing things right
537557 if were practicing well theyre going to throw us a bone here
537558 sam it has helped him being in a camp before being at a professional level knowing what its like but i think brett has done a really good job of adjusting to this point pretty well
537559 im feeling real good about our defense and about our team i just see a lot of hungry young guys and some crafty veterans
537560 to be locked in this tiny cell for twenty one hours a day is horrendous
537561 we are kept under a 21 hour lockdown no access to fresh outside air or outdoor recreational activities staffs are very verbal ly abusive
537562 i previously requested for transfer several months ago because of lack of outdoor exercise at etowah my request was denied because of a contention that etowah meets the minimum standards
537563 the amount of food served us as adults is less than enough for a five year old child the daily servings are beans and cornbread at times we are served mashed potatoes or rice but the amount is two tablespoons or when there is no cornbread one slice of bread
537564 how do four men spend twenty one hours a day in a cell
537565 i slept and slept i looked at pictures of my kids i read the bible
537566 looking back i would have advised county officials not to get into it
537567 the only one whos making a profit here is the sheriff
537568 its an incentive for him to go as cheap as possible feeding inmates to maximize profits
537569 the county inmates that would come in the unit to fix or replace something were always happy with the food and would talk about pizza and other menus
537570 an apple a day keeps the doctor away in etowah forget about seeing fruit unless youre watching a tv or a corrections officer eating
537571 but when quinn the eskimo gets here everybodys gonna jump for joy come all without come all within youll not see nothing like the mighty quinn

537573 the possibility of schism that looms ahead is precisely the latest from lambeth
537574 there was a guy about 130 or 150 years ago who had several losses before he won

537576 the green revolution is not as green as it was earlier it has now become brown and pale
537577 the profit margins have skewered to the minimum at this rate in 50 years punjab will become a desert like rajasthan
537578 the earth is now addicted to the use of these chemicals
537579 the major difference between chemical farming and organic farming is that with chemical farming the yield either decreases or stays stagnant over time while of organic farming field and quality of the soil increase
537580 after two or three years the yield will be equal
537581 for all we know those were rassilons naughty or nice list

537585 ik hou het publiek een spiegel voor bepaalde redeneringen die mensen maken licht ik uit vergroot ik en maak ik zodanig belachelijk dat mensen er stil bij gaan staan ik kan daar niet zomaar op antwoorden hoe mensen zullen reageren misschien kan het inderdaad dat ze te veel zullen relativeren dan is het zo waarom zou dat niet goed zijn tot nu toe is de enige communicatie over extreemrechts het feit dat het slecht is terwijl als we even stil staan het duidelijk is dat onze maatschappij goed rechts aan het worden is de rechtse zaak is geen marginaal feit meer
537586 de meeste wedstrijden zijn een pak sneller dan vorig jaar ik heb voor het eerst deelgenomen aan een halve triatlon in brasschaat het resultaat daar was buiten alle verwachtingen

537600 this is the best opportunity for bn to wrest the permatang pauh seat
537601 it clearly shows that she was not sincere about serving them
537602 before this he said he would be contesting in bandar tun razak or kulim bandar baharu then suddenly he wants to contest in permatang pauh
537603 i think hes in a hurry to contest in a by election because theres a police case against him

537607 people thought that anwar was a genuine warrior but yesterday he showed his true colours if he is a warrior indeed why should he be hiding in a safe place and inviting people to challenge him there

537616 its only recently that the well heeled phone and cable lobby have been beaten back by a well organized public we are coming together in increasing numbers to see that these special interests are not allowed to set internet policy for the nation the internets true greatness lies in those of us who use its level playing field to challenge the status quo create and share new innovation and ideas take part in our democracy and connect with others around the world without permission from any gatekeepers

537631 my photos are often described as capturing a feeling of isolation and while that is there i am also interested in exploring a contemplative form of solitude or most especially public solitude of the kind one would feel when walking down a street alone or that feeling you get while sitting on a street curb contemplating a crack in the sidewalk as the world passes by

537732 it is truly an honor to work with such a respected and revered person like muhammad ali his life career and humanitarian efforts have had a lasting impression on people of every race religion and ethnicity
537733 its a natural fit for ali to be the focal point of cards that inspire and motivate others to reach their goals persevere through hardship and celebrate their many accomplishments in life the cards truly capture his spirit and determination in a way that moves others to strive for greatness in much the same way that the greatest of all time has done throughout his life

537802 pacarannya bukan yang macam macam biasa aja seperti sekarang paling paling sering belajar bareng gimana
537803 jangan pikir terlalu jauh deh yang gampang aja setuju ya
537804 gimana ya biasanya orang pacaran kemana mana bareng jalan bareng ooh saat ini kamu adalah orang yang paling dekat dengan aku
537805 ya aku pikir mungkin ada aturan khusus sebagai pacarmu aku harus bagaimana

537809 tapi biarin aja deh cocok kok yang satu cantik dan yang satunya lagi ganteng
537810 kemarin juga aku ketemu mereka di 21 lagi nonton bareng wah kalau ketahuan banyak orang pasti jadi gosip yang paling menghebohkan selama ini kan mereka berdua memang dekat namun mereka tidak pernah mengakui kalau mereka berpacaran
537811 apalagi selama ini lika berkali kali menolak setiap laki laki yang menyatakan cinta padanya
537812 semuanya gara gara aku nonton bareng anak anak senat lika juga ikut itu sih anak anak aja yang membesar besarkan
537813 hey kok jadi enggak enak gini sih aku sebenarnya tidak pernah menyukai lika kalau dulu ya itu dulu berbeda dengan sekarang udah jelas

537821 rosa aku sudah tidak memiliki perasaan apa apa dengan dia kebetulan dia menonton film yang sama dengan aku
537822 aku nonton rame rame dengan rafli ogi dan teman teman kantor yang lain
537823 aku percaya tapi aku tahu siapa lika aku tahu bagaimana perasaan dia terhadap kamu dan kamu pura pura menutup mata
537824 rosa aku ngerti aku ngerti banget karena itu aku sayang kamu
537825 bukan itu yang mau aku dengar jangan coba dekat dekat aku
537826 aku mau tanya apakah aku marah waktu aku tahu kamu nonton dengan hilman tempo hari
537827 bukan maksud aku tolong percaya aku sama seperti aku percaya kamu
537828 kalau aku lihat aku nonton bareng lika sama seperti kamu nonton dengan hilman
537829 oh jadi ini benar ya ini adalah balasan yang kamu lakukan atas kesalahan yang aku lakukan
537830 harusnya kamu ngerti dong waktu itu aku tidak sengaja nonton bareng hilman karena aku ketemu di bioskop bener bener tidak direncanakan
537831 maunya kamu aku lari begitu ketemu hilman atau pura pura tidak kenal acuh tak acuh itu yang kamu mau
537832 kenapa setiap aku coba bicara baik baik kamu selalu membalikkan masalah itu kepadaku pasti karena aku duluan yang salah aku duluan yang marah aku duluan yang berpikir negatif dan selalu aku yang memancing emosi kamu selalu aku yang mulai mencari masalah atau mengangkat perbedaan perbedaan antara kita
537833 kapan aku bisa bicara tanpa ada ketakutan kamu akan mengungkit semua kesalahan aku kenapa selalu seperti ini
537834 kamu yang egois kamu yang tidak mau mengakui kesalahan sendiri
537835 coba jangan bersikap kanak kanak seperti ini berpikirlah yang dewasa
537836 aku sudah tidak tahan lagi lebih baik kita pisah saja sementara
537837 kamu tidak pernah belajar menghargai aku sebagai istrimu kamu sering membuat aku merasa kecewa dan membuat aku bersedih
537838 oke aku juga menyesal kenapa dulu aku mau menikah denganmu
537839 he hit a lot of good iron shots and made some nice putts hopefully we can do the same tomorrow
537840 it could have been a better round than that but youve got to take what it gives you a few short putts here and there would have made a big difference but i made a few as well so that kind of evens it out
537841 it was fine i was focused on my round i wasnt worried about phil and im sure he wasnt worried about me
537842 i dont know what the other groups had but gosh we had a lot of people
537843 i thought the crowds were great they were funny made some funny comments and it was really fun they were great to both me and vijay it was a great day
537844 we both birdied 15 we both birdied 16 and i thought both of us played okay played pretty good
537845 we could have been better could have been worse tomorrow will be a fun shootout
537846 its going to be a big challenge with four guys being right there and a number of guys right behind us
537847 so im not really thinking about what it would mean
537848 sambil menunjukkan kartu undangan dia bercerita banyak tentang perasaannya yang sudah dia pendam selama ini dia selama ini selalu menunggu kamu ros dan sekarang dia bener bener patah hati
537849 ya biar bagaimanapun saat ini lika tetap teman ham dan saya tidak ingin menyakitinya
537850 aku sengaja mengajak kamu berkenalan dengan ayah dan ibuku sekaligus memberikan kejutan ini
537851 semuanya aku yang siapkan dan spagetti ini aku buat spesial untukmu kecuali yang ini aku beli
537852 hadiah yang sangat istimewa aku tidak pernah berharap kamu akan memberikan aku kejutan seperti ini
537853 if i do play well if i do start playing well like i did today i think i would be an addition to the team
537854 and if i dont play well i would not be i would not expect a pick i just want to play as well as i can and see where it takes me
537855 im a long way out of it at the moment and i need to show excellent form
537856 ive got four tournaments left and i need to play well in those
537857 if i do he may consider me for a pick if i dont ill be watching it on tv like everybody else
537858 all summer long and probably the past three to four months ive pushed and pushed and pushed and tried too hard and practiced too hard and worked too hard
537859 ive wanted to play too well too much whereas now im just playing and enjoying it and seeing what that brings
537860 its really good to get back on to pure greens again as good as these are and start rolling in those four or five footers to save par
537861 i havent been making those this year and that puts me on the back foot straightaway like anybody ive gone back to my old method wider stance and slightly higher hands
537862 it would be nice to win a wgc maybe 20 or 30 years from now theyll have prestige much like the guys who first won the masters had no idea what the tournament was going to become they wgc events started midway through my career so i havent given them the priority like i do a major or care about them like a major but they are always the best fields on great courses so theres a lot of merit to whoever wins
537863 these are a rung down obviously from the major championships but i havent won a world golf championships so thats obviously missing on my cv it would mean a lot and give me a massive amount of confidence going into next week too
537864 for a couple of days afterwards what if goes through your head that i could have been the u s open champion
537865 at the same time you cant let yourself dwell on those emotions and youve got to turn the positives out that you played great under pressure and nearly won a major
537866 hadiah yang sangat istimewa dan aku enggak pernah berharap kamu akan serepot ini menyiapkan spageti untukku terima kasih banyak ya
537867 dan terima kasih juga untuk kejutan yang menyenangkan ini rosa enggak pernah menyangka kalau akan seperti seperti ini
537868 mereka akan terkaget kaget jika hubungan kita diketahui banyak orang rosi memilih wanita diluar kriteria
537869 ah diluar kriteria apa sih kamu jangan aneh aneh gitu lah
537870 apakah setelah saat ini kamu akan terus rendah diri jika jalan berdua denganku
537871 jika aku menjadi istrimu aku akan berjalan beriringan denganmu dan akan terus menggenggam tanganmu untuk itu aku tak perlu lagi minder atau takut
537872 entahlah yang pasti aku menyesal karena sudah marah marah seperti tadi maaf aku sungguh sungguh minta maaf
537873 aku yang salah membuat kamu tidak mempercayai aku aku salah aku minta maaf
537874 aku sayang kamu aku sayang sejak pertama aku tahu kamu sayang aku
537875 ya udah tidur di kamar tamu aja ya malam ini aku lagi sebel
537876 tolong buak pintunya kalau tidak dibuka aku akan tidur depan pintu ya
537877 maaf ya aku ngantuk banget tidur di atas lantai sangat tidak nyaman
537878 walau aku suka duluan tapi semuanya karena kamu yang membuat aku jadi suka
537879 hey belum tidur juga ya aku hanya tes kuping aja kok
537880 becandanya kasar kalau bener seperti itu aku enggak mau sayang duluan siapa coba yang pertama kali suka
537881 loh kok minta maaf sih harusnya aku berterima kasih sama kamu
537882 terima kasih untuk apa terima kasih karena aku udah malu maluin
537883 ya udah aku enggak akan tanya itu lagi walau penasaran banget
537884 stop aku enggak mau bahas itu aku cuma ingin mendengar kamu bilang sayang sama aku
537885 he hit a lot of good iron shots and made some nice putts hopefully we can do the same tomorrow
537886 it could have been a better round than that but youve got to take what it gives you a few short putts here and there would have made a big difference but i made a few as well so that kind of evens it out
537887 it was fine i was focused on my round i wasnt worried about phil and im sure he wasnt worried about me
537888 i dont know what the other groups had but gosh we had a lot of people
537889 i thought the crowds were great they were funny made some funny comments and it was really fun they were great to both me and vijay it was a great day
537890 we both birdied 15 we both birdied 16 and i thought both of us played okay played pretty good
537891 we could have been better could have been worse tomorrow will be a fun shootout
537892 its going to be a big challenge with four guys being right there and a number of guys right behind us
537893 so im not really thinking about what it would mean
537894 i havent been with anyone in two years how can it be herpes
537895 any time you want a baked potato just pop in and you can have one on the house
537896 can i have a free potato and one for my friend and one for my other friend
537897 sen john glenn announced today his endorsement of sen hillary clinton
537898 show me a successful woman over 40 who isnt considered difficult
537899 hes still playing great it happens in every sport when someone sets the bar so high guys find a way of creeping up behind you
537900 i dont think theres a huge difference between a semifinal and a final but to win it would be huge
537901 im going to have to play against one of the best players in the world to win it i feel like im playing well enough to do it
537902 ive looked at a number of other specimens sat in a few other wagner auctions but this is the one that makes collecting worth while
537903 since i was 8 years old ive hoped and dreamed that one day id be able to get one
537904 the mystique and allure of the t206 wagner card continues to grow
537905 brian nichols should have paid for five funerals one of them his own
537906 i would want somebody on the jury who would not prejudge my loved one
537907 for instance the catholic church is against abortion and im pro choice
537908 although judicial elections and contributions to elected judges are a well established means of selecting a state judiciary there will be rare cases where campaign expenditures by a litigant create a constitutionally unacceptable appearance of impropriety this is such a case
537909 a line needs to be drawn somewhere to prevent a judge from hearing cases involving a person who has made massive campaign contributions to benefit the judge
537910 people are very aware of who contributes to their campaigns
537911 what do we think the role of the judge is impartial decision maker is the most important aspect of due process all of the other due process type rights mean nothing if we dont have an impartial decision maker
537912 in this area there is a lot of difference of opinion among judges and smoke about whether there are limitations or should be
537913 situations like the one in west virginia do not put those differences to rest
537914 from any and every case in which an independent nonparty organization over which the judicial officer had no control received contributions from individuals or groups which included a person or entity affiliated with a party or an attorney in the case when the independent nonparty organization used its contributions to wage a campaign against the judicial officers electoral opponent
537915 conversely such a standard would likely require a judge also to recuse himself or herself when an independent expenditure group operated against the judge or supported the judges opponent
537916 our judicial system would break down under such a standard for disqualification
537917 this case centers on a very simple fact a man who was the beneficiary of 3 million in expenditures by a single litigant 60 percent of the money raised should not be sitting on cases by that litigant
537918 it would spur judges to seriously reflect on the meaning and letter of the aba standard
537919 on a more systemic basis it would invite and spur states to consider measures that might offer additional protection right now there is an extraordinary lack of predictability that goes with question of whether justice is for sale
537920 in the illinois scenario one could argue the interests of the contributors were arguably more diffuse it was trial lawyers versus defense bar
537921 here it truly involves a sole individual the ceo of a litigant facing a 50 million judgment who personally spent 3 million

537925 i hoped for changes but they didnt happen under heffern i like my job ill see this through to the end its not just about me but its about doing the right thing
537926 many of us minorities in the office are harmed by this
537927 how do you evaluate the breadth of your knowledge about you sic field
537928 the city attorneys office engaged in a practice that has a disparate impact on attorneys of color seeking promotion to the attorney ii position
537929 respondent actively consults with the city attorneys office and essentially plans and designs the interview process for attorney ii applicants respondent assisted the employer office of the city attorney in the complained discriminatory practice
537930 the idea is that the city attorneys office probably couldnt have done it itself hr collaborated with the city attorney
537931 in any government agency human resources has to be separate to implement policies and procedures it has a watchdog function
537932 it set up the promotional system candidates for ranking hiring and firing
537933 nearly every attorney i or attorney ii expressed dismay with the promotional process and the changes in the office atmosphere
537934 is necessary to finding and promoting the best candidate and that it provides those involved in the hiring process the best information on which to judge the candidates
537935 seriously lacking as a justification for a practice that results in a demonstrable disparate impact on a group of employees
537936 no one whos applied for the midlevel attorney position has been denied for as long as ive been here
537937 trial and negotiation skills hard work and preparedness are more important i have a hard time believing that any test can capture that exclusively
537938 it should have a greater understanding of fair process than other places do sometimes organizations that are less learned arent as likely to self correct but this is a government agency and we hold it to a higher standard
537939 its arbitrary and they couldve gotten the outcome a different way
537940 thank you for coming out for the movement for green jobs that is growing across the country
537941 the movement is growing because more and more people are recognizing the urgency of our collective situation we are at a point where we can use our planets resources for economic sustainability or create an ever more dangerous polarization of wealth and poverty
537942 green jobs are not a pie in the sky idea indeed millions of americans already hold jobs intertwined with a green energy economy that combats global warming
537943 500 good union paying jobs are being performed right now today theyre represented by the united steelworkers we want to see those jobs maintained here while were in st paul
537944 this is a perfect example of where we can have both
537945 as the blue green alliance we need to work together to make sure that plant stays here and those jobs stay here and those workers have food on the table and frankly st paul and the metro area doesnt have another gaping hole where manufacturing has left the area none of us can afford that
537946 our conflicts were drummed up in the media and it was fueled by the bosses desire to divide and to conquer us but we believe that were ahead of the curve were all in this together
537947 today we recognize that global warming has emerged as a significant threat to the stability of union jobs in the coming years we have concluded that the environment is an essential union issue in the same way that globalization and trade are essential union issues so is the environment
537948 if we are to be successful in pursuing a world that is more economically just and sustainable in the long term then environmental work must be part of the mission of our work in the union every day and at every level of the union
537949 you are the ones who will carry this forward to fruition you are offering what americans want the chance to move forward together uniting our energy needs with our middle class hopes and our demand for environmental stewardship
537950 is our preferred combustible fuel option after conservation and truly clean renewable energy sources from solar and wind are seriously considered
537951 we talked to actual loggers and asked them how much they would be able to deliver this was really the practical step the answer was yes theres several lgoging operations that could supply the full amount at a certain price the biomass sources are the lowest on the totem pole the tops and the limbs
537952 how long will equipment hold up and how does it produce but gasification has technical advantages possibly including emissions benefits on the financing side its easier to get investment in better known technology but with a government guarantee for the loans investors wont care
537953 well find a safe green energy that can be a model for future mills and industries in the area and across the country

537955 i like birthdays its the party im not sure about
537956 preschoolers by definition are learning to integrate the incredible overwhelming data from the world around them its hard and struggling with it demonstrates just how much there is out there to see hear touch etc it can point out the richness and beauty of the world to us the adults who are really good at integrating and it can also help us to notice the very sensitive little souls for whom sometimes its just too much
537957 if his immune system is so sensitive to food why could his little body not also be so sensitive to other triggers like noise and touch in our case
537958 this gives me hope as i am functioning as least reasonably well i also believe these children carry with them enormous gifts in their sensitive little bodies
537959 billions of pounds has been spent on it but no thought has gone into how the police are going to use the images and how they will be used in court its been an utter fiasco only 3 percent of crimes were solved by cctv theres no fear of cctv why dont people fear it they think the cameras are not working

537963 not like many other areas of the law where you have to show harm
537964 for regular people who dont have thousands of dollars the inclination is to settle the cases rather than to fight
537965 arguing that a buffer copy for a streaming view is a duplication thats even more of an uphill battle and the potential awards might not be worth the attorneys fees
537966 merely watching a video on your screen authorized or not isnt going to be an infringement if youre not publicly performing or copying it
537967 for instance if my local network tv affiliate were to broadcast an infringing copy of a tv show and i were to watch it at home i would definitely not be liable the copytraps idea might come into play had i however innocently taped or dvrd the broadcast
537968 the fact that theyre not aware that a video was illegally uploaded is irrelevant all that matters is that they clicked on a link and watched the video
537969 spoke informally with one lawyer who told us that that area of the law is ill defined
537970 i agree that their logging the content exiting their nodes would appear to constitute interceptions of those electronic not wire communications under the wiretap act and i dont think they qualify for the narrow provider exceptions 18 usc 2511 2 a i so i still see the same potential civil and criminal liability that was noted in our faq

537977 if a traveler is unwilling or unable to produce a valid form of id the traveler is required to undergo additional screening at the checkpoint to gain access to the secured area of the airport
537978 beginning saturday june 21 2008 passengers that willfully refuse to provide identification at security checkpoint will be denied access to the secure area of airports this change will apply exclusively to individuals that simply refuse to provide any identification or assist transportation security officers in ascertaining their identity
537979 passengers who lie and claim to have lost or forgotten their proof of identity will still be able to fly

538012 what weve inherited from 12 years of mr costello as treasurer is the second highest interest rates in the developed world together with his being part and parcel of a government which was engaged in climate change denial and work choices
538013 so on that score ive got to say its quite clear cut to me that the liberals whoever their leader is have a real problem with their policy direction for the nations future because of the legacy they left us from the past
538014 ive got to say their problem is one of policy of being locked so far into the past theyve lost their way personalities i think are secondary to it
538015 with the liberal party youre dealing with not a question of personalities its policies
538016 the new yorker may think as one of their staff explained to us that their cover is a satirical lampoon of the caricature senator obamas right wing critics have tried to create but most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree

538228 cuando trabajaba en la princesa mononoke cre de verdad que iba a abandonar estaba cada vez m s d bil y no sab a qu hacer como el trabajo del director exige en primer lugar talento y no fuerza f sica luch para acabar la pel cula especialmente porque la estabilidad financiera de la productora depend a del estreno del film cuando se dio a conocer mi retiro la noticia se extendi como un reguero de p lvora aunque la princesa mononoke no estaba terminada ni mucho menos los periodistas siempre empezaban la entrevista preguntando si ten a planeada la siguiente pel cula mi vida personal cobr m s importancia que la pel cula y con ello se cuestion el futuro de ghibli un d a estaba un poco alterado y contest que la princesa mononoke ser a mi ltima pel cula hasta me convenc a m mismo de que hab a terminado mi carrera invert todas mis energ as en la batalla final incrementando mis expectativas y exigiendo cada vez m s a mis colaboradores ya estaban bajo una presi n enorme y mi actitud dej agotados a los empleados de ghibli muchos sufrieron crisis nerviosas yo segu a convaleciente y a n sent a el peso de muchos a os de trabajo pero afortunadamente todos estos sacrificios no fueron en vano la princesa mononoke consigui un xito mucho mayor de lo que hubi ramos podido so ar

538237 how are veritable ideas to be distinguished from illusions by learning the origin of each
538238 ideas are emanations from the divine mind thoughts proceeding from the brain or from matter are offshoots of mortal mind they are mortal material beliefs ideas are spiritual harmonious and eternal beliefs proceed from the so called material senses
538239 let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus
538240 know then that you possess sovereign power to think and act rightly and that nothing can dispossess you of this heritage and trespass on love
538241 if you maintain this position who or what can cause you to sin or suffer

538247 the divine manifestation of god which comes to the flesh to destroy incarnate error
538248 i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end
538249 to break this earthly spell mortals must get the true idea and divine principle of all that really exists and governs the universe harmoniously
538250 christ is the true idea voicing good the divine message from god to men speaking to the human consciousness
538251 speaking to the consciousness of those who discern the voice and label themselves christians
538252 in him we live and move and have our being

538268 procedures are in place for a reason and this is a clear indication our workforce is doing a great job
538269 but the average person doesnt know what a bomb looks like all he knows is what he sees on television and the movies
538270 and this rule means that all homemade electronics are confiscated because anything homemade with wires can look like a bomb to someone who doesnt know better the rule just doesnt work
538271 and in todays passengers fight back world do you think anyone is going to successfully do anything with a fake bomb

538281 there is an orderliness in the universe there is an unalterable law governing everything and every being that exists or lives it is not a blind law for no blind law can govern the conduct of human beings that law then which governs all life is god hence i gather that god is life truth and love he is love he is the supreme god

538283 hey this isnt fair this is supposed to be my off season
538284 disease is always induced by a false sense mentally entertained not destroyed disease is an image of thought externalized whatever is cherished in mortal mind as the physical condition is imaged forth on the body
538285 become conscious for a single moment that life and intelligence are purely spiritual neither in nor of matter and the body will then utter no complaints if suffering from a belief in sickness you will find yourself suddenly well sorrow is turned into joy when the body is controlled by spiritual life truth and love

538342 the expansion of private i e mainly corporate power and the selective abdication of governmental responsibility for the well being of the citizenry
538343 the privatization of public services and functions manifests the steady evolution of corporate power into a political form into an integral even dominant partner with the state it marks the transformation of american politics and its political culture from a system in which democratic practices and values were if not defining at least major contributory elements to one where the remaining democratic elements of the state and its populist programs are being systematically dismantled

538765 the great white shark is a warmer water shark and very rarely is it found in canadian waters
538766 its numbers are down everywhere and that is of concern to scientists
538767 it used to be 20 years ago id hear reports of a couple of great white sharks being seen every year in our waters now we just get one report about every three years or so
538768 people see this giant dorsal fin sticking out of the water and they see it swimming towards a beach they think theyre going to be gobbled up by the jaws thing fortunately that is not going to be a problem because basking sharks have no teeth and are filter feeders theyre really gentle giants
538769 in my mind the bull shark is probably the nastiest of all sharks its one of the very few sharks that seem to enjoy attacking people but its a tropical shark and never found in our waters
538770 it too is incredibly rare in our waters and when it is seen it is often in the gulf stream 200 kilometres offshore
538771 they spend the entire day down there before returning to the surface at night
538772 so it looks like we may have this huge feeding area out there in the north atlantic and this deep diving behaviour in the daytime is really exciting news and something we are following up on right now
538773 these are carnivorous sharks thriving in very deep cold water typically below five degrees celsius this is truly a strange shark which may be responsible for the majority of attacks on seals off sable island
538774 its a very slow moving and apparently lethargic shark with lots of relatively small razor sharp teeth we have no idea how long they live or if theyre active predators or scavengers thats what were researching now
538775 in colloquial language people living in ethnically diverse settings appear to hunker down that is to pull in like a turtle
538776 to withdraw even from close friends to expect the worst from their community and its leaders to volunteer less give less to charity and work on community projects less often to register to vote less to agitate for social reform more but have less faith that they can actually make a difference and to huddle unhappily in front of the television
538777 may underestimate the real effect of diversity on social withdrawal
538778 seem fully as unnerved by diversity as those raised in the 1920s
538779 the last hope of human liberty in this world rests on us we ought for so dear a stake to sacrifice every attachment amp every enmity

539107 i still think that we are going in the right direction
539108 geelong has been a much better side than us over my period of coaching but i think geelong would be saying that they are getting more competitive games of footy against richmond now than what we have had in the past
539109 we have still got some things to clean up if we want to be the best and we know that and we understand that
539110 percentage is no issue for us if we lose to geelong by two goals or ten goals obviously we want to get as close to them as we can but its going to make no difference to our outcomes at all
539111 winning and losing is going to make the difference to our outcomes and we have just got to put our best foot forward over the next couple of weeks
539112 its what you do in the three or four weeks after you play geelong whether it puts you into your shell or whether youre prepared to get back on it and play your footy we were five out of six leading into this game and now we are five out of seven and that is still pretty reasonable form for this time of year
539113 i told the team that they probably should put every effort into winning this game for this man because he has been such an important person for the club
539114 hes an on field role model and hes just been amazing a little bit of who we are is because of people like him
539115 im biased because ive coached him and seen him play and seen him develop and ive seen him take full back into a new era
539116 ive never seen a defender play such an attacking role and have attacking influences on a game of footy while hes playing on the best player from the opposition who kicks the most goals i said openly this week that i think hes changed the face of back line play hes an outstanding player
539117 we were pretty open this week he did train on wednesday night and he was fine doing a lot of things
539118 he was a little bit sore changing direction so we decided together that he wouldnt play
539119 this morning saturday he did everything at training so wed expect that hed play next week
539120 i thought moran really changed the game for them being that target up forward i thought he presented well
539121 to his credit he made the most of his opportunities he did change the momentum of the game for adelaide
539122 to be as close as were its not a bad effort considering their clanger count but you cant win games of afl footy kicking the football like we did today
539123 i think we over finessed the footy i thought we turned the ball over when we were in control and they sweated on our mistakes
539124 its probably the most frustrated ive been all season on performance i thought we had enough of the ball to hurt adelaide and we gave it back and paid the price
539125 the players were trying to pick up players and they virtually collided and the player went down

539144 so on that score ive got to say its quite clear cut to me that the liberals whoever their leader is have a real problem with their policy direction for the nations future because of the legacy they left us from the past
539145 ive got to say their problem is one of policy of being locked so far into the past theyve lost their way personalities i think are secondary to it

539231 what weve inherited from 12 years of mr costello as treasurer is the second highest interest rates in the developed world together with his being part and parcel of a government which was engaged in climate change denial and work choices
539232 so on that score ive got to say its quite clear cut to me that the liberals whoever their leader is have a real problem with their policy direction for the nations future because of the legacy they left us from the past

539274 its a weird sensation not being able to feel your lips but it hasnt hurt which is great
539275 there was a bit of swelling and bruising but after a few days nobody noticed anything unusual
539276 the last time i had my lips enhanced they looked a bit fishy and they were a bit top heavy this time the balance is correct and they look natural but poutier
539277 lip enhancement is simply enhancing the shape and size of ones lips to suit their natural proportions there is no point in over exaggerating lips so that they no longer appear to fit on a persons face i see a lot of people who want lip enhancement and they quite commonly bring in pictures of their desired lips from magazines i often have to tell them that i cant make their lips into someone elses but i can help them improve the natural shape and size of their own lips

539301 the yoga camp organized by tathaastu so be it magazine honestly exceeded all my expectations it was fun educational stimulating and above all super organized while interacting with the participants who had come from all over usa it was obvious that this camp was meeting a serious need for learning alternative means to well being and health i think the 5 day format of methodical teaching is also an excellent idea that ensures thoroughness of learning and minimizes error in home practice
539302 it was a blissful experience meeting swami ramdev his yoga techniques are simply splendid
539303 many of us in the washington dc area have been ardent admirers of swamiji already but the recent yoga camp has electrified dc and the surrounding community there is a new wave of enthusiasm and people are joining hands toward the collective pursuit and promotion of knowledge imparted by swamiji my wife yog and i were privileged to have hosted a most remarkable dialogue between swami ramdevji and a vast number of physicians it was an eye opener for us to learn how many doctors are also utilizing swamijis teachings already

539309 weve been scoring a lot of runs lately the law of averages was bound to catch up with us
539310 we faced two pretty good pitchers the last two days and nothing was really happening for us
539311 he was a different pitcher then he had a lot more fastball struck out more guys
539312 i enjoyed watching him as a kid i dont necessarily enjoy facing him now
539313 we just couldnt get much going against him he knows what hes doing out there
539314 no doubt mussina has recreated himself when he was young and his arm had a little more velocity he still had that great command with all his pitches
539315 right now hes adapted and learned what he needs to do with not quite as much fuzz as he used to have hes still got that uncanny command
539316 when hes got command of his five pitches hes going to be tough to hit
539317 i think he has changed hes not trying to really attack you in the strike zone he wants to see what youre going to chase he showed that with me in the first inning a four pitch walk
539318 he threw me four pitches all very close he kind of wanted to see where joes strike zone was today home plate umpire joe west and see what i was going to swing at
539319 its a little frustrating when youre trying to put guys away
539320 they fouled off a lot of pitches so you knew they were going to be right on it today
539321 the one to betemit wasnt a bad pitch the one to a rod was right where i wanted to put it
539322 i looked back at the replay on the scoreboard video screen after he crossed the plate and angels catcher jeff mathis never moved his glove he was probably sitting on heater away i probably should have worked him inside more he put a good swing on it nothing you can do about it he is who he is its one of those things you just tip your cap

539336 green builders not only have to consider how their homes are constructed and how efficiently they run but also where these homes sit in proximity to shopping and recreation
539337 sustainability really requires that home builders look at the bigger picture
539338 its helping us out because with high gas prices and groceries anything you can get now for free is a help
539339 we have traveled through the northwest and almost all of the united states and we have seen wildlife and western images that have inspired us
539340 weve decorated our home with one particular product weve found and then discovered that the product was manufactured in gainesville texas just 20 miles from where we live we loved their products so much that we decided we were going to market them
539341 while looking for other products i discovered an etched glass and mirror product and we have since introduced all of those items to our web site
539342 we will be introducing similar products as we have the opportunity to grow and discover other items
539343 ive written poetry and i sing and entertain and the cowboy western songs are a part of me my love for the western lifestyle and the wildlife lifestyle is included in that my wife gets a big kick out of me when i hear a bird sound i duplicate that sound in a whistle wild animals make a howl call or bark and i duplicate that this is very much a part of who we are
539344 we want to focus on wildlife themes so this will be information relating to hunting fishing and outdoor activities
539345 well try to provide information on artists of all varieties dealing with the outdoors
539346 ive always been interested in electronics so this was an easy choice for me
539347 what im actually trying to do is create a business thats almost like a wholesaler its a deep cut in prices im not taking much of a mark up on items to begin with and now were running a sale on top of those prices i want to see how that works out passing savings on to customers
539348 im almost retired so im not looking to get rich
539349 im doing this more or less as a hobby i think its fair to the customer to not take a huge margin on the product and to give them the necessary savings that other retailers dont offer
539350 ill be using my blog to promote the different products on my web site
539351 im going to do research on each of the products and give customers all the necessary details im also going to talk about my future projects and communicate with customers about our deals
539352 obviamente no podemos estar felices con este resultado especialmente cuando nuestros principales rivales han monopolizado la primera fila

539357 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
539358 the pretended vicar of christ on earth who sits as god over the temple of god exalting himself not only above all that is called god but over the souls and consciences of all his vassals yea over the spirit of christ over the holy spirit yea and god himself speaking against the god of heaven thinking to change times and laws but he is the son of perdition ii thess 2
539359 he is in an emphatical sense the man of sin as he increases all manner of sin above measure and he is too properly styled the son of perdition as he has caused the death of numberless multitudes both of his opposers and followers he it is that exalteth himself above all that is called god or that is worshipped claiming the highest power and highest honour claiming the prerogatives which belong to god alone
539360 whereof it followeth rome to be the seat of antichrist and the pope to be very antichrist himself i could prove the same by many other scriptures old writers and strong reasons
539361 that tyranny which the pope himself has for so many ages exercised over the church
539362 the very antichrist and son of perdition of whom paul speaks
539363 some persons think us too severe and censorious when we call the roman pontiff antichrist but those who are of this opinion do not consider that they bring the same charge of presumption against paul himself after whom we speak and whose language we adopt i shall briefly show that pauls words in ii thess 2 are not capable of any other interpretation than that which applies them to the papacy
539364 we here are of the conviction that the papacy is the seat of the true and real antichrist personally i declare that i owe the pope no other obedience than that to antichrist
539365 the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders
539366 chill out folks he isnt here yet and god will take care of him when he shows up
539367 what i resent is all the phony christians ive run into who arent real christians who tell me
539368 thats my problem is that when hitler was slaughtering people all over europe most christians literally laid there and took it because they said oh hes the anti christ this is the end of the world
539369 and so im saying that i have a choice to make i have to in this one life to live im being tested and im not going to just say the games outcome is already you know the die are already cast and so im not going to be involved and im not going to try to do something and take action
539370 but no i totally agree with what youre saying sir its just that i have found that religion has become this big blanket people rap themselves in and then dont ever do anything
539371 the bible does not and i repeat does not say the holy spirit is the restraining power it does not say what the restraining power is
539372 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
539373 the business has been a challenge for me its a learning curve
539374 i like to learn new skills and while its occasionally a little frustrating it has definitely put me in contact with some wonderful people and has helped me grow as a businessperson i had been looking for a way to have a business i could manage from anywhere and this opportunity presented itself after that it was only a matter of putting in the time and effort
539375 one of the nice things is that my supplier is in the next town from me to me thats a true advantage because i can physically go there and find out about anything i need to know or to correct any problems that spring up the products i carry are all karooch essential oils which i feel are a very good product i use them myself so im not selling something that i just chose out of a hat its a product that i have faith in and that i personally know the benefits of
539376 because of the blog and the business itself i find im learning more and more about essential oils
539377 its a very healthy product and its very versatile in its uses im discovering new uses every day its very exciting
539378 im using my blog to force myself to do more research
539379 a lot of people ive spoken with dont know much about essential oils
539380 they dont know how to use them or what diffusers are homeopathic medicine has a lot of different applications but you dont have to use it for a specific reason you can just use it to freshen up a room essential oils affect our limbic system so they can make you feel refreshed or relaxed they can make a room smell good and they can make you feel good this is all far beyond a plug in air freshener because these are natural oils as i learn more i can pass on more of that knowledge its a great thing to learn for yourself but its a wonderful thing to pass on that information to others
539381 i came from a country where i was able to exercise and run outdoors every day
539382 i moved to canada where the winter makes it very tough to maintain that sort of outdoor exercise routine i tried persisting for a year or two but then i realized that i had to get myself into an exercise and training program in order to be able to train indoors without necessarily going out to a gym i knew that i was not alone in this need and thats how i got started on the idea of selling home fitness equipment
539383 i will be providing information about exercise and health both physical and mental
539384 i want to help people find the balance in their lives for exercise working toward motivation and the benefits received ill be discussing exercise programs that work for particular groups as well as helping people find their motivation to maintain that program the equipment will be discussed at length helping people discover which items are best for use in different applications so that they dont spend money on something they will not use
539385 i feel that exercise is very important for your health and wellness because theres a direct balance between physical fitness and mental health and wellness
539386 as a person becomes older its even more important to stick to a healthy self care program i am into the middle age group and because of that ive realized how important it is to stay healthy and fit maintaining all of the benefits that come from good fitness if you stay healthy the way you experience life in general is more healthy

539413 i cant help it ive been watching your style for a couple o f days now and i cant help but notice how short a time it takes you to address the ball you just get up there and smack it has that always been your approach
539414 you see angel cabrera he puts it on the tee and then hits it it is a very natural swing i dont think anything about my swing just put the ball on there see the line thats all
539415 it is very very natural i dont think just see the line put the ball and hit it thats all
539416 he said eduardo i think this is your week thats all i hope he is right
539417 before i won he said eduardo you are the one you have to win your game is good your game is ready you have to win this is good advice
539418 i hit it often because my callaway ft 5 driver goes too far
539419 i try to stay out of bunkers he just carries his ball over them he is amazingly long
539420 i be here in the middle of a post round celebration again tomorrow

539422 john mccain looks forward to debating barack obama as often as possible but its disappointing that senator obama has refused his offer to do joint town hall meetings we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of barack obamas magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider
539423 the american people expect and deserve no less unfortunately it appears that barack obamas tough guy talk on duels this week was just more empty words americans are quickly coming to the conclusion that its better to look at what barack obama actually does and not listen to what he says
539424 i am going to take some time in the weight room and the training room but it is nothing serious nothing bad we just want to make sure it doesnt linger throughout the year
539425 as the pain subsides he will increase his activity if the pain stays low we will increase the activity so it is basically a day to day week to week type thing
539426 the plan is to train and get it to the point where it doesnt hurt any more
539427 and however long that takes it takes i mean it could be anywhere from two weeks to five weeks
539428 last week i was throwing with max hall and dennis pitta and i could only run about five routes and it started bugging me too much
539429 one day this mother of one of the girls that would spend days at a time at our house came over and asked us to take her child in as a foster child because she didnt want to lose her child to the streets and drugs
539430 so we did and after that we got into foster care
539431 the idea of them being able to see lambeau field they just keep talking about it theyve seen it on tv theyve watched the packer games theyre thinking its going to be so fun and exciting
539432 i think that everybody has a calling in life and its our job as people to listen to the voice of god to what your calling might be no matter what it is
539433 whether its working with boys and girls club or coaching a team or doing what were doing were just following the calling that we believe gods given us
539434 we have a really deep heart and love for kids and we believe really strongly in whether a child is in our house one day or permanently that theyre part of family for that one day or permanently
539435 thats where adoption resources of wisconsin or childrens service society of wisconsin have been for us in our experience because weve ended up adopting most of our foster kids
539436 then they go through and finish the home study and then we go through the adoption process
539437 when the kids were making the extreme makeover video one of the things they all said was mom its so important that we continue to keep taking in kids and helping kids and that we let other people know the need out there so that kids can go to good healthy happy families
539438 its one full of some ups and downs but a lot of love
539439 and the love far outweighs any of the difficulties that you might come across
539440 i would never forget coming out of the old locker room i remember brett favre telling me that there is going to be more people here than i ever had at alcorn state and i was like aw yeah right whatever then i walked out and saw 60 000 plus it was amazing
539441 i think its important to let these guys line up and play
539442 im not interested in schematically challenging one another as far as putting one side of the ball in a better position than the other i think its just more important for our guys to go out there and play at game speed in a game environment and do all of the fundamental things that we have been working on
539443 maybe the first time it did but i think once you get to green bay and you see how passionate the fans are and see how everyone around here comes out to watch training camp practice you understand real quick how passionate they are and how much they care
539444 we expect it and we enjoy it i think it helps us get better as a team because its our first step to getting toward a game type atmosphere
539445 jordy has really come into the spring and really picked things up and i really like the way he plays with his pads
539446 he plays with a good pad level he is fundamentally strong particularly for a rookie it is definitely not too big for him i just look for him to continue to get comfortable and get the timing that he needs with the quarterbacks but i think he is off to an excellent start
539447 theres probably some plays where i forgot completely some stuff going through my head and where im supposed to go but it happens
539448 jennings and driver they help me out where im supposed to be on the receiver when they run a certain route and stuff like that help me out i ask them questions i try to learn from them as much as i can
539449 i think hes been consistent and i like his ability to burst on a football hes someone that when you talk about football players when they put their pads on thats what its supposed to look like ive been pleased with him
539450 im trying to be perfect out there for the coaches and stuff im trying to get everybodys attention on me making plays and knowing everything fast it is kind of tough

539453 even though these outsourced processes are less critical they still require exhaustive systems for raw material equipment and environmental controls to ensure product output and product realizations are always within design specifications and regulatory compliance
539454 this is exacerbated due to the critical life support nature of the product supplier processes often require objective evidence to prove they are scaleable and fully validated to all applicable national and international standards and regulations to comply with ventracors global regulated market
539455 it is not currently possible for ventracor to produce all of its assemblies and components in house to do this would be prohibitive from a cost competency and time to market perspective
539456 as our global market increases the product volumes also increase placing downward pressure on our cost of goods sold cogs
539457 one role of the supply chain overall is to deliver continuing reductions in cogs without quality compromise concurrently while the internal processes are optimized to gain maximum efficiencies
539458 careful management and controls are required to ensure the risks are minimized while satisfying the companys goals and corporate milestones providing a challenging tightrope to walk

539488 silicone breast implantation a retrospective review of 1012 implants placed by a single surgeon
539489 this study reveals low complication and revision rates and also gives some insights into which factors may lead to implant revision
539490 i wanted to complete this study because since the voluntary moratorium imposed by the food and drug administration in 1992 epidemiologic data involving newer generation silicone implants has been relatively sparse these cohesive silicone gel implants are believed to be even safer than prior versions because additional cross linking in the silicone gel material helps the implants hold their shape even when punctured torn or cut
539491 it is important to note that over a third of the revision procedures performed had nothing to do with correction of complications and instead were performed because the patient desired a different implant size
539492 factoring out these patients the revision rate to address surgical complications was actually 5 0 the observed complication and revision rates compare very favorably to the mentor core study which had patient complication and revision rates of 30 6 and 15 4 respectively
539493 this is one of the first steps in what i hope becomes a much more thorough and complete set of medical literature on the topic of cohesive silicone gel breast implant safety
539494 prior generations of silicone implants have become some of the most studied medical devices ever created and i am confident that the more favorable safety profile envisioned with cohesive silicone gel implants will be confirmed through subsequent studies

539570 i think theres plenty of time for me to look back at the end of the season or at the end of my career and say you know what that was cool or i remember that or i remember that game but for me having the opportunity to have the longevity that i have is the most special thing for me to continue my career and to play and to contribute with a team i think that is first and foremost if you are around long enough those things are going to start to happen
539571 as long as im still having fun and im contributing ill keep playing
539572 look i feel great and im pitching well and i love playing so i have no plans to stop
539573 but i could come in here tomorrow and the desire could be completely gone
539574 some players get injured and others just lose the desire
539575 then some for one reason or other are told to quit because they reach a certain age or time spent in the game some just accept it without asking why
539576 lots of weather data at your fingertips the main weather watcher live window contains a real time picture of your current weather conditions
539577 sab amos que la sesi n de calificaci n iba a ser muy igualada y as ha sido

539580 initially purchased to find stolen cars a handful of so called tag readers are in use across the washington region to catch not just car thieves but also drivers who neglected or failed their emissions inspections or let their insurance policies lapse the district and prince georges county use them to enforce parking rules i just think it makes us a lot more effective and a lot more efficient in how our time is being used a senior detective said
539581 but i think my heart and souls always been here
539582 i grew up here i learned my chops here i learned how to be a winner a champion here

539588 fortunately it appears the doctors were able to diagnosis things early and they expect me to enjoy a complete recovery
539589 i am excited to return to coach the team during preseason camp and expect to be back out on the practice field next week
539590 mr foster and his abolitionist friend will further our agenda and that is all that matters mr foster ill be in touch heres my card
539591 they watched their friends and classmates die ask them how they came into the country i want you to tell their story to the board
539592 they would have been killed if peter hadnt rescued them
539593 i thought getting a white slaver license was counterproductive now i understand i can buy slaves on the spot how many lives have you saved
539594 theres more to it than simply getting the girl if you free her how will she live will she wind up enslaved again within hours dev puts women through school makes sure that they have jobs the ten year contracts have provisions for early manumission but it is mandated on the woman being more valuable as a free woman that means money she has to be able to earn her freedom if the woman cannot stay free on her own she is better off protected
539595 my mother promised to spit roast me alive at her next womans club meeting i ran to the castleman estate and volunteered to be peters slave i have never regretted it
539596 it was my 18th birthday my father had bet me and my mother and lost i was at hills fine meats and i was going to be spitted i had watched my own mother die on the guillotine master peter pointed at me and said how much mr hill gave me to master peter look you can just make out my meat brand
539597 if you cant explain it without becoming an uberspot ranger you dont need to say it
539598 numbers are meaningless make it mean something now in small words explain what went on at the nsa meeting
539599 but the real news was that the 32 enslavement rate was not taken from all women just about 29 of the female population are in the age band from 16 to 55 and eligible meaning that they are not pregnant or with small children
539600 sorry colonel instead of 1 in 3 women being enslaved the actual target is 1 in 9 that is proving to be uneconomical right now i thought that the goal was 65 million slaves with about 45 million of the slaves coming from the prime group of 54 million women those ages 16 through 24 the other 20 million would come from the group between 25 and 45 i feared that 5 out of 6 women in an entire generation would wind up as slaves i was wrong the reality is quite different because the infrastructure is still being built social structure will change but social change takes time we are looking at no more than 17 million slaves at the end of the decade about a quarter of the slaves i had expected theres also going to be a lot of imports annette and maria here
539601 they didnt understand the signage that said cross this line under penalty of conversion they claim that their tour guide told them to wait in there
539602 but that doesnt mean that dev or the slave rescue service are just a waste of time first we take good women off the market and give them good lives if they are targeted for conversion they can very easily be enslaved certain career fields will be slave traps actresses especially because of their residuals why pay an actress when you can buy her or trick her most of the sex trade will follow those women are considered disposable by society anyway im afraid that colleges are going to become slave traps the college coed is in the prime enslavement age range she is smart and pretty and away from home for the first time in her life so she is vulnerable to anyone for a bit of phony affection compared to high school graduates who dont attend college it appears as if both more college coeds and a greater percentage of college girls will be converted the nsa was laying the groundwork for that with the lesser jurisdiction designation of colleges and universities to cinch the deal nsa has a model school conversion contract they aim to enslave 1 in 3 college seniors and as many of the underclassmen women and college drop outs as they can because the college girls make better slaves oh yes the medical field has great need of slaves most of the nursing chores will be done by slaves theres housekeeping for those who didnt make it to college but were enslaved
539603 the nsa speaker bragged about how all those idle rich brats would be enslaved and snuffed who needs them anyway well thats what he said he was talking about a campaign to make enslavement chic the idle rich tend to be more politically active and they create many of societys problems
539604 ive figured out that the white slave act isnt about money
539605 that reminds me of another career slaves will dominate motherhood
539606 of course there is also the 20 of men who are openly and exclusively gay free women will be less likely to bear children than slave women
539607 that dark prediction is unlikely you were wrong about the enslavement rate i think you are wrong about the motherhood issue
539608 the castleman trust could have simply been a sperm bank we whole heartedly embraced slave mommies i like it and i suspect that the heterosexual man will chose slave wives and slave mommies over free women im sure that free women will not willingly accept sharing their man with another woman especially an inferior slave woman i read about the abuse that wives of slave owners dished out to the slave women
539609 se supone que hemos rodado con menos gasolina que los dem s y por eso este resultado de hoy me gustar a creer que no es as pero supongo que esa la causa de que estemos tan adelante pero igualmente intentaremos hacer una buena clasificaci n poniendo a punto el coche de la mejor manera el coche tiene algunas modificaciones que se probaron la semana pasada en jerez y creo que est n funcionando bien
539610 hay carreras que sobre el papel son dif ciles como puede ser esta o como puede ser monza pero aqu de momento las sensaciones son bastante buenas es verdad que es probable que estemos este viernes tan arriba por un factor de gasolina pero a n as el coche ha respondido bastante bien y tampoco es que nuestros rivales directos como toyota o redbull no es que hayan sobresalido
539611 this cant be true this thing was getting so many good reviews but for me it just doesnt work
539612 people are getting a little too arduous in their mourning for barbaro

539614 we know that the public at large is grieving the loss
539615 her name is randi and she tried to commit suicide by going to hills randi isnt old enough to vote yet so peter managed to save her life right now randi is a person of limited rights and under my care
539616 you could have gone to spellbook slaves and all of your troubles would be over
539617 he told me that if i loved him id let him fuck me when i refused he said that there was more pussy available
539618 interfering with lawful slave trade is a felony and if you go to jail you cant find marvela you wife would be judicially enslaved neville might have enough cash to buy her out as an agent of still waiting on his slavers license right at the moment the only way to insure that leonora isnt bought by an alternate meat source plant she could even wind up as a lab animal or in a torture club do you know how many people hate their parents how many gladly pay for a mother substitute to torture and snuff
539619 dear master you are over wrought again save who you can save let natural selection work its dark magic not everyone will live
539620 master peter is trying to keep you from breaking the law master george yes you love your daughter so do you mistress leonora
539621 master peter has an attachment disorder it is the opposite of the caligula syndrome master peter is a sheepdog we sheep have trouble telling sheepdogs from wolves but sheepdogs protect the flock because it is who they are a wolf may prevent another wolf from poaching but a wolf is a wolf
539622 tamara jayne smith as of 10 45 am this friday december 7th 2001 you are a person of limited rights belonging to defensive enslavement volunteers over the next 90 days you will undergo evaluation intended to develop your academic and business careers not to mention your personal life this is the major question we will answer what will you do with the rest of your life
539623 youve been watching too much television mistress many owners suffer from the caligula syndrome they have absolute power over another person and the owner isnt able to deal with no limits
539624 now not every suffer will go the route of hannibal johnson he was bombed out on drugs according to his autopsy
539625 master peter may i discuss your case with these people so that they can feel that their daughter is safe
539626 master peter has been monitored for post traumatic stress disorder since he was 17 he killed some people in the line of duty but he is free of pstd master peter kills only when he has to protect the people you see on the torture and snuff channels kill for a variety of reasons theyre angry theyre sad theyre frightened and if they dont kill they will die and the girl they were supposed to kill will die anyway caligula syndrome sufferers will kill because they can and because they like it they like feeling the power rush causing another fear pain and death lets the suffer forget being scared in pain and mortal
539627 even if i didnt own slaves i am a force professional traditionally we force professional monitor each other that is the answer to who watches the watcher we watch each other we are bound together by bonds of mutual loyalty loyalty to each other to our organization to the constitution today we enlist professional such as doctor prince a castleman trust slave who calls herself summer she is a talented psychologist
539628 thank you master we were on our way to cougar county with randi master peter wants randi to promise not to kill herself
539629 i know it is a long time but i need that much time to show you that life is worth living i care about you randi
539630 step one is to promise that you will give me three years that you wont kill yourself step two is a little bit easier simply write a letter telling your family that you are okay for at least the nest three years if they want to get in touch with you well deal with it then if not im sure that well find an acceptable substitute
539631 slave or not i am treating you like an adult even if your official adult status is three weeks away
539632 tamara i have a mission for you i dont want you to leave randi alone for one moment you are going to tell me everything you know about your sister neville is in charge of her rescue operation i can assist but nothing illegal if it means that marvela dies as long as her killers are acting within the law then we will hold a memorial service for your sister theres a lot we can do first find her the worst is if she winds up on one of nmgs snuff shows they have deep pockets and even 100 000 wont be enough to bail her out most ams dealers will sell out for a tidy profit
539633 now what were you told when you filed the missing persons report
539634 they told us that marvela was an adult and she was free to do what she pleased
539635 i got no help these past two weeks they finally took a police report last week but they have no cause to investigate there is no evidence of foul play they said that there was nothing to investigate
539636 he said he was our friend and that he wouldnt take our money he checked the slaver data base and marvela wasnt there
539637 suzie adopted them theyre still pups i found a dead female coyote about a mile away
539638 father got her from the air force five years ago suzie had puppies
539639 she used to guard the b 52 fleet she has a reputation as a biter when she came to live with us i was only 16 and at first she was in charge now she lets me be in charge she runs my dog pack but she lets me be in charge
539640 thats the secret to peters dog training success suzie does the training and peter takes the credit
539641 professor morrisons truck has been spotted and is about 30 minutes away i need to alert your protection detail governor
539642 my orders are that you attempt to capture them dont take any unnecessary risks of course but give them a chance to surrender
539643 i have combat arms people with me do i ask them to play cop or soldier
539644 cops arrest criminals and gather evidence for trial cops use the minimum force necessary to control the situation and effect capture
539645 soldiers especially combat arms soldiers destroy the enemy we will use our most powerful weapons at maximum ranges to minimize our own casualties that group is equipped for close combat and is very skilled if they dont surrender we cannot handle them with anything less than concentrated rifle fire your protection detail needs to guard you if you need it my pilot can fly you to safety
539646 flying isnt safe you do what you need to one dead bodies raise eyebrows
539647 peter has a lot of slaves he doesnt eat them when they die and he really doesnt have room here for a cemetery thats his private crematorium four bodies no problem the car i know people who will make it disappear
539648 good we dont need publicity take care of it lieutenant and get me my niece
539649 professor morrison this is darcy listen carefully please you are being watched i am commanded to ask you and the others to surrender peter is running the show and he wont let you get away dont give him an excuse
539650 the fourth horse is on his way to the corral
539651 this didnt happen gentlemen if it were known that organized rebellion to the white slave act existed it would encourage more rebellion are you finished with the bodies lieutenant
539652 sunday evening i need to go back to the capitol

539656 i am making you wear clothes you dont get a choice in the matter i have determined that it is too cold outside for you to be exposed to the weather as soon as we return to our trailer you get naked and i will lock you in the cage
539657 i told you the first time this makes you unique i wish i could magically replace your missing finger im accepting it because it is you and we cant do anything about it tell me again how you lost your ring finger do it in french so that annette and marie understand i want the woulfes to practice french too not everyone speaks english

539660 that includes bathroom breaks when one of you uses the bathroom all of you do
539661 when their english is better i might have them work down here
539662 lets ask did you notice how much service weve been getting how there is no discrimination against slaves here
539663 and hearing your stories will help her adjust dont get yourself in trouble with the boss
539664 we know you besides you are good for morale when you are in town all of my girls are happier

539666 how do you want me to sign your autograph book im called peter castleman so often that i might have to adopt that as my stage name
539667 master peter can i be your slave when i grow up

539671 not right now it isnt good for your penny to lose her mother i have a number of free women living under my roof some will be slaves but not right now some will remain free i dont know which you would actually work for a slave does it bother you to have to obey a slave

539689 la de ma ana es una carrera en la que hay que tirar en todas las vueltas aqu no hay descanso y mucho menos en mi posici n ya que tengo que tirar durante toda la carrera y eso lo sufre el coche como nosotros
539690 oh my gosh guys i sold out my show this weekend and killed it the audience loved my material and it was such a high hearing all that laughter oh and the sugar cube tube finished filming our new pilot for the networks so today were improving my friends lets go
539691 my mom told me shed like to get me a nose job for my 16th birthday even though i never asked for one
539692 when i was in the 3rd grade my mom told me she named me amy because it was easy to spell
539693 i was in the 7th grade and never had a boyfriend
539694 i hope he doesnt think i wanna nail him just because were talking
539695 hang in there huge financial breathing room is just around the corner

539700 lick it in circles all the way around the base of the cone
539701 with the liberal party youre dealing with not a question of personalities its policies
539702 what weve inherited from 12 years of mr costello as treasurer is the second highest interest rates in the developed world together with his being part and parcel of a government which was engaged in climate change denial and work choices
539703 so on that score ive got to say its quite clear cut to me that the liberals whoever their leader is have a real problem with their policy direction for the nations future because of the legacy they left us from the past
539704 it was a major turning point that luke odonnell penalty he is entitled to play the ball
539705 a couple of my staff saw it and they said he was entitled to play the ball
539706 if i look at the video i can find someone off side it is like sometimes we are trying to stop people from scoring
539707 i dont know what the issue is with luke but to me i am not sure it would have happened to any other player
539708 geez he has just come off a suspension which is debatable he has come off a few other things which have been debatable
539709 we will probably get an explanation on it but it doesnt help us in the heat of the battle
539710 we havent even spoken about next week being the battle of the wooden spoon
539711 we are looking at winning games but we have done it as tough as anyone we have used more players in the nrl this season than any team
539712 this fearmongering by politicians is just another form of extortion dont fall for it
539713 birds are highly visual animals like humans and other apes so their plumage color evolves because it serves as a signal to other birds especially when choosing a mate plumage color and ornamentation also correspond to the birds mating system long lived monogamous birds that mate for life are often sexually monochromatic while polygynous birds where the males do not assist in parental care are very strongly dichromatic so based on that information what would you predict for the reverse situation where the females of the species are brilliantly colored while the males are cryptically colored

539738 on the basis of the accumulation of the various testimonies and indirect evidence the international court of the nascent sanhedrin came to the conclusion that there were unnumbered cases of killing of innocent falun gong practitioners by agents of the chinese government perhaps also out of consideration of material benefits derived from organ harvesting
539739 if the human rights issues are not addressed before the olympic games begin we consider participation in them by athletes and by spectators and political leaders to be an indirect danger to world peace
539740 report into allegations of organ harvesting of falun gong practitioners in china
539741 as a jewish child growing up in the wake of the holocaust i made a vow to myself at the very young age of 13 that if it ever happened again i would do all i could to put a stop to it
539742 now as a human rights lawyer and legal participant in this case i thank the sanhedrin for finding the courage and wisdom to expose and condemn the crimes perpetrated by the chinese communist party against members of the falun gong faith in china
539743 not only as an objective judge but at the same time as attorney for the side which is absent
539744 assure the minimum of liberties as indicated by the seven noahide commandments
539745 if the human rights issues are not settled before the opening of the olympics participation in these games may be understood to indicate indifference to human rights violations in china and support for suppression
539746 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
539747 when you come to the olympic games in beijing you will see skyscrapers spacious streets modern stadiums and enthusiastic people you will see the truth but not the whole truth you may not know that the flowers smiles harmony and prosperity are built on a base of grievances tears imprisonment torture and blood
539748 some foreign observers estimated that falun gong adherents constituted at least half of the 250 000 recorded inmates
539749 continues to receive regular reports of torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment taking place in rtl facilities
539750 in the lead up to the 2008 olympic games beijing police have used abusive detention practices such as rtl to clean up the city

539805 me im a minimalist i like lots of it thats a joke but ive always liked the spare poetry of kay ryan
539806 ever the modern gal i like that her poems are short and deceptively easy to read
539807 shes a hell of a poet and a great person to boot
539808 kay ryans appointment to the post has potential people so im hopeful
539809 ryan is skillful accomplished and more than deserving of this honor but i dont much care for her poetry which tends to be simple spare and playful just a matter of taste really simic is a hard act to follow and is a personal favorite im happy to see a woman have the honor again after so long a string of men but i had hoped to see jorie graham named like billy collins and ted kooser kay ryan writes poetry that is very accessible even a caveman could read it sometimes that simplicity appeals to people who dont read more complex or surreal poetry so perhaps ryan will draw a wider audience and that will surely be a good thing for poetry

539818 ryans poems characteristically take the shape of an observation or idea in the process of clarifying itself although the poems are brightly sensual and imagistic there is often a strongly didactic sense at work

539834 what weve inherited from 12 years of mr costello as treasurer is the second highest interest rates in the developed world together with his being part and parcel of a government which was engaged in climate change denial and work choices
539835 so on that score ive got to say its quite clear cut to me that the liberals whoever their leader is have a real problem with their policy direction for the nations future because of the legacy they left us from the past
539836 ive got to say their problem is one of policy of being locked so far into the past theyve lost their way personalities i think are secondary to it
