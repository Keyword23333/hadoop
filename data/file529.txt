5290103 even those widows who enjoy social insurance cant get it directly because all insurance documents must be in a mans name
5290104 a widow always is considered a burden and subjected to more criticism and interference from others
5290105 for instance a young widow may not remarry because she must preserve the dignity of her dead husbands family moreover those with children should never consider remarriage or theyll lose custody of their children
5290106 many widows have disclosed that they feel embarrassed about constantly asking their relatives for help preferring instead to make their own income

5290112 the overwhelming majority of widows are in despair we cant do anything for them unless we instill hope in their minds and make them feel their importance as effective members of society
5290113 were planning to make deals with restaurants and cosmetics stores to buy and market the widows products

5290253 the majority of victorian crops are looking healthy but with little subsoil moisture anything is possible from a poor finish to excellent returns
5290254 many farmers are reluctant to sign grain contracts after disasters last year when many crops didnt yield enough for their contracts and were still worried about what will happen to farmers in the top of the state this season

5290291 honey seeing you go through letting go of stephanie this week is bringing back a lot of memories and emotions about something i went through last year when you went to china to be on survivor i went through exactly the same thing only worse did you think i wanted you to go no way everything in me screamed no but i knew it was what god was calling you to do so in spite of my fears and the difficulty i let you go

5290436 the delay in opening after the holidays is regretted but the health and safety of staff and pupils is our main concern

5290471 the us national hurricane centre nhc expects fay to miss offshore production areas in the gulf and instead hit florida on tuesday or wednesday

5290480 john mccain and i fundamentally disagree on how we are gonna move this country forward he ran a negative ad which is most of the ads he runs he ran a negative ad that claimed all my economic plan was was higher taxes and that it would lead to economic disaster
5290481 ive got news for john mccain my plans not gonna bring about economic disaster we already have economic disaster from john mccains president george w bush and we cant afford another four years or eight years of george w bush policies and thats why were gonna beat john mccain in this election to put america on a new path

5290495 we are pleased that senator mccain clarified the remarks and we thank the senator for once again re iterating his belief that issues concerning marriage and family laws should be left up to the states not the federal government the fundamental principle of federalism has made our party and our country strong and those in our party who would seek to sacrifice this core value in order to push an extreme anti gay agenda do damage to our party and our country

5290503 vanilla summers by the way is my future stripper name
5290504 its good to have a game like this so we can battle back
5290505 it wasnt a bad race but of course we cant be happy with our final position it was one of the most difficult races of my career i pushed very hard to get to front and i didnt have a bad feeling with the bike at all in the first laps i seemed to be able to close the gap to the front runners but the grip level of my rear tyre went down after only eight or nine laps i dont know why but i lost more grip than the others and my lap times got worse then the gap between me and the front runners got bigger as the rear tyre continued to go down i tried whatever i could to stay with them including braking very very late but it wasnt enough
5290506 its better for us that simoncelli finished third but at the same time we need to win races this is what counts
5290507 my start was good and my positions werent so bad up until mid race after that i started to feel less comfortable on the bike when other riders passed me it was very difficult for me to follow in the end the gearbox broke and i couldnt shift some of the gears any more but i feel still lucky because at least i was able to finish the race
5290508 we could see that mika couldnt quite match the pace of the leaders he tried everything and rode a really good race but he wasnt able to make a podium finish today as far as the world championship goes our chances are still there because simoncelli only finished third
5290509 it was an exciting race with a brilliant performance by mika who achieved the best possible result under the circumstances considering his rear tyre problems it was really good with just a little bit missing to make another podium finish luckily we experienced some damage control when simoncelli dropped back to third
5290510 ive always been a big fan of putting into the market on a regular basis regardless of what is happening in the overall market
5290511 if ive learned anything in the more than a quarter of a century of following the markets it is this fact buying stocks when you know you should i e during sharp down moves is really difficult our heads says we should after all substantial market downturns create the best values
5290512 but our emotions usually take control thus making it very difficult to pull the trigger and put money into the market when stocks are falling
5290513 thats why ive always been a big fan of 401 k plans with these investment vehicles investment programs are put on autopilot with dollars being put into the market on a regular basis usually each paycheck regardless of what is happening in the overall market
5290514 fortunately investors can duplicate the autopilot feature of 401 k plans with their drip investments by taking advantage of automatic monthly investment features provided by most drips
5290515 so who are using these services a high ranking amazon executive told me there are 60 000 different customers across the various amazon web services and most of them are not the startups that are normally associated with on demand computing rather the biggest customers in both number and amount of computing resources consumed are divisions of banks pharmaceuticals companies and other large corporations who try aws once for a temporary project and then get hooked
5290516 high prices cure high prices and if prices go up too fast demand will fall and prices will fall and i just think thats a lesson that were learning once again
5290517 my gut feeling is that were going to see oil prices continue to go lower and i wouldnt be surprised if we saw gasoline prices continue to go lower it seems with the dollar getting stronger and demand dropping off its really pressuring prices to the down side
5290518 as the number of business users of social networks continues to increase advertising expenditures will rise too

5290596 over the past 30 years american politics has become more money centered at exactly the same time that american society has grown more unequal
5290597 so you think all of this is just going to go away if obama gets in
5290598 we are now entering one of the most intense political periods that we have ever seen
5290599 we are jamming in a lot of major events the selection of each candidates vice president their national conventions the debates and election day
5290600 when they gathered in philadelphia in the summer of 1787 our nations founders sought to establish justice insure domestic tranquility provide for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity today we the people must do all we can to create a more perfect union focused on the common good

5290602 i think there are a lot of americans who are disaffected by both the left and the right whether its the secular left or the religious left or whether its the secular right or religious right
5290603 this is a critical time for our nation and the american people deserve to hear both candidates speak from the heart without interruption in a civil and thoughtful format absent the partisan gotcha questions that typically produce heat instead of light
5290604 the economy is the one issue that continues as the dominant voter concern
5290605 for many months i have warned that there needs to be active international engagement to peacefully address the disputes over south ossetia and abkhazia including a high level and neutral international mediator and a genuine international peacekeeping force not simply russian troops no matter how this conflict started russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over south ossetia and invaded another country russia has escalated its military campaign through strategic bombing and the movement of its ground forces into the heart of georgia there is no possible justification for these attacks

5290622 many companies in china buy melamine scrap to make animal feed no law or regulation says dont do it so everyones doing it
5290623 for years melamine has been quietly mixed into chinese animal feed and then sold to unsuspecting farmers as protein rich pig poultry and fish feed many animal feed operators here advertise on the internet seeking to purchase melamine scrap
5290624 it just saves money if you add melamine scrap melamine will cost you about 1 20 for each protein count per ton whereas real protein costs you about 6 so you can see the difference

5290659 high prices cure high prices and if prices go up too fast demand will fall and prices will fall and i just think thats a lesson that were learning once again
5290660 my gut feeling is that were going to see oil prices continue to go lower and i wouldnt be surprised if we saw gasoline prices continue to go lower it seems with the dollar getting stronger and demand dropping off its really pressuring prices to the down side

5290665 out going chair minnesota governor tim pawlenty deserves a tremendous amount of credit for moving america closer to clean energy
5290666 another significant challenge facing our nation is the rebuilding of its infrastructure
5290667 if america is to continue competing in the global economic marketplace we need an efficient and sound infrastructure for the past two decades state and local governments have been picking up more of the tab for infrastructure repair but we cant keep it up
5290668 we need the commitment of greater federal resources to help states meet these pressing needs
5290669 infrastructure funding making sure our roads bridges schools airports trains ports and water systems are safe is an issue about which i am very passionate
5290670 it started when i was mayor of philadelphia and continues today because i see that our nations aging infrastructure is hurting our economic stability and hampering future growth
5290671 americas infrastructure urgently needs attention from outmoded ports to crumbling bridges to underinvestment in public transit we must begin a new era of investment in the systems that support our prosperity and our quality of life
5290672 state and local governments now fund 75 percent of all infrastructure work we will need the federal government to step up significantly if we are to fully meet this challenge i will continue to work with my fellow governors to give these issues the attention they deserve

5290679 if only the bloody thing would let me do what i want i wouldnt have to work out this idiotic circumlocution to please it
5290680 theres not even any gossip going around about who did it and that tells me it probably wasnt local kids
5290681 youd think theyd be bragging about it but there hasnt been one whisper along that line
5290682 my own personal thought is it was somebody from out of the area
5290683 that there have been several scientific papers published in peer reviewed scientific journals that suggest other possible explanations for the crop circle phenomenon than aliens or pranksters
5290684 most of which indicate exposure of the plants and soils to microwave radiation unusual electrical pulses and strong magnetic fields
5290685 some believe that the crop designs are messages from alien spacecraft
5290686 some maintain that the aliens are trying to communicate with us using ancient sumerian symbols or symbolic representations of alien dna

5290691 we look at october as a critical step in our development
5290692 cost of living increases especially skyrocketing gas prices have significantly impacted nonprofit groups like meals on wheels in minnesota that rely on volunteers with their own vehicles
5290693 we would want to be supportive of any legislation that makes a long overdue adjustment to the volunteer mileage rate
5290694 i think a lot of people never claimed this mileage deduction they consider it part of their donation with gas prices going the way they are it would make it more affordable for people to be able to volunteer
5290695 it took almost eight years and that was hard work
5290696 i would still like to inch it up or maybe foot it up

5290708 we will not bow to pressure from any parties as the state governments policy is aimed at protecting the interests of the public
5290709 there is no change in our policy on hillside development and we are serious about it he told starmetro
5290710 we are elected by the people and our decisions will always protect the rakyat he added
5290711 i was voted in based largely on this premise and judging from what was disclosed in thesun i am very upset that i was not even consulted about this attempt to compromise on this policy
5290712 we were elected on this ticket and a promise of an open and transparent government even the intent of going back on our word four months down the road is unfair to the people and is political suicide
5290713 instead of supporting them ronnie and teresa should ask them how they acquired hillslope land in the first place
5290714 the process of alienating land on hills and hillslopes is highly suspect and the state government should not entertain them at all come on they want to cut hills and whatever technology they use will not be able to counter the environmental side effects
5290715 even if there is going to be a change the stakeholders must be consulted and the whole process must be open wasnt this what they promised of transparency and accountability in the run up to the elections
5290716 it does not give the impression of impartiality when a profit based private organisation tries to use two excos to break a policy

5290725 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5290726 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5290727 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5290728 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5290729 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5290730 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5290731 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5290732 mr bidens strengths and weaknesses as a vice presidential nominee are glaringly obvious and in many cases overlap at age 65 he would bring heft knowledge and nearly four decades of experience in washington to a ticket headed by a relative political newcomer but that experience he was first elected to the senate at age 29 and has served for nearly four decades would undercut mr obamas image as an agent of change
5290733 mr biden is among the best informed lawmakers on international affairs a gap in mr obamas r sum but mr bidens broad knowledge his committee chairmanship and his longtime membership in the most exclusive debating club in the nation also feed his biggest flaw a verbosity and love of his own voice that drive many including by some accounts mr obama nuts
5290734 an apparent effort by former presidential hopeful mike huckabee to diminish the chances of former rival mitt romney becoming the republican vice presidential nominee is reviving questions about whether romneys prospects are being damaged by opposition from evangelicals and religious conservatives gary bauer an evangelical leader who is an informal adviser to john mccains campaign said in an interview yesterday that evangelicals are divided but discounted the idea there is an organized effort to stop mccain from picking romney
5290735 bauer said he personally believes that romney would be a great running mate and said he has conveyed that message personally to romney bauer chairman of the campaign for working families political action committee said he was not allowed to say whether he advised mccain to pick romney
5290736 ridge said yesterday he thinks republicans would accept a vice presidential candidate who supports abortion rights but he said whomever john mccain picks as a running mate should defer to mccain on the issue
5290737 biden and obama staffers discussed the proposed trip and obama officials said they were glad biden was considering it one source familiar with the discussions added that had the obama team opposed the idea the senator would likely not have gone
5290738 and john sometimes hes a good person but hes a little bit given to this kind of bellicose rhetoric which has a tendency to inflame conflicts rather than to diffuse them and thats not what you want in a president
5290739 shows one more time that in a dangerous and troubled world its helpful to have a leader of the nation that knows these places knows the people understands the setting
5290740 that came after sen joe lieberman went as a mccain envoy
5290741 now as mr mccain prepares to accept the republican presidential nomination his response to the attacks of sept 11 opens a window onto how he might approach the gravest responsibilities of a potential commander in chief like many he immediately recalibrated his assessment of the unseen risks to americas security but he also began to suggest that he saw a new opportunity to deter other potential foes by punishing not only al qaeda but also iraq
5290742 mccain told usa today on sunday that he has no problem with his top foreign policy adviser randy scheunemanns past lobbying work
5290743 mccain said he found it interesting that barack obamas campaign called him confrontational with russia
5290744 worried about whether someone on my staff had supported georgia or not
5290745 nationally bush won almost 60 percent of the rural vote but republican john mccain doesnt appear to be doing as well
5290746 and check out this line from his weekly radio address
5290747 one reason we see near term strength is that prices approached key trend line support at the 110 level on friday and held and this could result in further short term buying by chart based traders
5290748 in addition the dollar is not exerting a bearish influence on prices as we start the new week
5290749 lastly tropical storm fay now working its way towards the florida keys is causing some nervousness

5290760 we are not taking away these schools specialist status or the associated funding
5290761 we have postponed their redesignation until after their 2008 gcse results are known but they remain part of the specialist schools programme
5290762 weve never called these schools failing many of these schools are improving are on the right track and are doing a good job for their local communities
5290763 parents and prospective teachers are already aware of the issues these schools face the bottom line is that they can now be confident national challenge schools will get the extra money and extra support they need to improve further
5290764 it would be absurd for the government to financially penalise schools with lower results
5290765 hi guys im the theme author and cant find any record of them paying for the theme im not sure at this point what my options are but im looking into it
5290766 you also have no idea who is responsible for hosting the site and so your claim that new media maze cocked up the launch is factually incorrect
5290767 its been a day when we have really showed we are an international team racing in two countries
5290768 the nurburgring lms race was a good result and went to plan for us with everyone else having problems while silverstone was also going to plan and the cars ran well but went out due to a racing incident and oil on the track
5290769 tomas did his out lap set the pole time then came back in it was very straightforward it is a good day for us
5290770 we brought the car here with the basic set up that the team used to good effect last year
5290771 that has worked very well and has allowed us to concentrate on other things particularly tyre selection i was quite surprised at the gap to the corvettes behind in qualifying but that was really more due to our tyre strategy than to me
5290772 it is always good to get pole position but in a race as long as this with so much traffic and on a relatively narrow track it is much more important to stay out of trouble in the race thats not easy when the straights are not so long the prototypes are not much faster than us out of the corners and all of the overtaking is done under braking
5290773 it is fair to say we dominated the race and the drivers were superb from about halfway through the second stint with the car we knew we could win the race and we had a drama free run which shows the quality of the work done by the crew in re building the car after le mans
5290774 it was tight at the beginning but after an hour and a half our rivals were already having problems so we were only racing the traffic and trying to stay out of trouble
5290775 its ok to not be ok but its not ok to stay not ok
5290776 have you lost your damn mind do you know women would die for your hair

5290782 city officials along with sports related and business groups interested in keeping keyarena afloat in a competitive market have begun working with the state legislature to secure 75 million to complete a 300 million remodel the city wants to create an nba ready facility with the hope of securing another basketball team in the near future according to the settlement the city could receive another 30 million from bennetts group in order to receive the money the legislature would have to fund 75 million toward the keyarena revamp by dec 31 2009 and seattle would still have to be without a team by 2013 unlike the prior four unsuccessful attempts by the sonics in olympia to secure public funding for a new basketball facility the city is taking a more proactive approach in dealing with state lawmakers in preparation for the 2009 session

5290792 we just say if you take these assumptions this is what the future may be
5290793 each scientific paper is hoped to be an ever closer approximation to the best possible answer to a question than was the work that had gone before we believe dr wangs paper fulfills that spirit
5290794 intel believes a wimax ready laptop could be available in the indian market at around 300 to 400 in a few months
5290795 among the two services wimax has more potential as it would help the country bridge the digital divide we estimate the market has the potential to reach five billion dollars in the next three years
5290796 in fact two to three million subscribers can be added in two months
5290797 the first set of arrests was part of the process of the investigation in which you can question anyone you think might have information

5290809 most people have a notion that elderly people have very weak immunity or they have lost immunity
5290810 this study shows that extremely elderly people have retained memory of being infected with the 1918 flu even 90 years later
5290811 its important to know that you can develop immunity to such a pandemic virus that has implications for new pandemic viruses
5290812 the elderly might be a very good donor source for finding antibodies against viruses
5290813 this study shows that humans can develop very potent immune responses against dangerous influenza that cause pandemics
5290814 it gives us hope that we can develop vaccines and antibody treatments for any other pandemic viruses that come along
5290815 the implication of this study is the 1918 virus was so powerful that the immunity you had to have in order to survive was so prominent that it lasted for the rest of your life
5290816 so those in certain age groups who had seen a related virus had the strongest responses
5290817 either they died or they developed a profound immune response
5290818 what i found out is that combustion generated particles contain environmentally persistent free radicals
5290819 when the radicals are associated with particles they can apparently exist indefinitely
5290820 the implication is you can have the same environmentally related diseases by exposure to airborne fine particles that you can get from cigarettes
5290821 these airborne free radicals are of interest but i am not sure we are at a point where our scalpel is sharp enough to dissect the individual components of air pollution that cause problems for people
5290822 there are studies that show that modifying free radicals can alter the course of disease
5290823 but the implications of this what it means to clinics what it means to doctors what it means to regulators i think we are a long way from pulling that together
5290824 we know that obesity per se is a risk factor for developing heart disease
5290825 but once you develop it is obesity more detrimental than not being overweight there have been different studies with results going both ways
5290826 with low dose statin therapy obesity was detrimental with more blockage what was unexpected was that with high doses of the statin obesity did not have much of an effect at all
5290827 they lower inflammation and people who are obese have greater inflammation there is a lot of evidence that inflammation in general is not good since a person who is obese has more of that going on statins tend to protect
5290828 what we can say is that if you have heart disease particularly if you had bypass surgery you should be on a good dose of a statin
5290829 if you are overweight or obese you really should take your statin and be aggressive about it
5290830 you get much more benefit than for someone who is thinner

5290855 aber katar hat auch gas gegeben und gut aufgeschlagen und sich das verdient auch wenn sie nat rlich nicht unsere st rke haben die deutschen junioren sind da schon zwei klassen besser

5290857 wir haben gesehen dass wir in dieser saison eine gr ere auswahl gleichwertiger spieler haben werden
5290858 vorstellbar w re dass katar wir und noch ein zwei andere bundesligisten gemeinsam ins trainingscamp gehen wo wir einzeln aber auch gemeinsam trainieren k nnen
5290859 wenn keiner mitmachen will dann macht eltmann das eben alleine mit den arabern

5290861 it is important that employers and employees who are subject to the statute understand what the law means and what our offices role is in enforcing that law
5290862 its important to me to tell stories you dont normally hear
5290863 and traditionally you dont hear womens stories a womans story can include men and have a male as a main character but still come from the lens of a woman and reflect a knowing of the world through that gender
5290864 there are so many women making feature films internationally i thought it would be great to bring those international films here
5290865 i also wanted to include a local component but without setting them apart i thought if we set them apart as here are the minnesota films it would diminish them as if they were being given special consideration
5290866 so that the people who made the films can be there and can talk about them and the audience can be engaged in that
5290867 you go out in the morning to shoot and by that night you have a story to broadcast its great training you learn how to work fast and to know what makes a great story

5290881 a documentary you can pick up a camera and film it on your own or with one other person once you start choreographing for a movie you involve more crew you hire a writer you block things out you have storyboards it just takes more money and more time
5290882 when you work for money all the time especially in a creative field youre painting someone elses canvas i wanted to paint my own canvas
5290883 i had to make these films it was just me and my camera i didnt have to get a crew or a grant or anything just me
5290884 i dont make a lot of money although hopefully thats going to change i do it because im not used to making a lot of money and because its a passion its the relationships my quality of life
5290885 its becoming more democratic i dont know if that will necessarily lead to better product but hopefully it will lead to more variety
5290886 these emerging filmmakers are do it yourselfers who dont want to be part of the system at all

5290918 last winter in baghdads annual army day parade hussein displayed some of iraqs extraordinary arsenal bought with billions of its oil revenues and with loans from its arab neighbors at least half of iraqs conventional weapons were purchased from its ally the soviet union but france was also a major source providing its sophisticated mirage fighters and deadly exocet missiles and there were many others china south africa czechoslovakia egypt and brazil at one point in the 1980s iraq was the biggest importer of arms in the world
5290919 the tuwaitha site located about 30 kilometers south of baghdad became the nuclear research center when it was chosen in the early 1960s as the location of the soviet supplied 2 mwth irt reactor and its associated facilities the reactor went critical in early 1968 which marks the beginning of nuclear research in iraq albeit limited the reactor commissioning was followed by an order of magnitude increase in the number of nuclear personnel in iraq from a few dozen to a few hundred people
5290920 the french had agreed to supply a 40 mwth mtr reactor called tammuz 1 or osirak a zero power reactor called tammuz 2 a materials testing hot laboratory named lama workshops and a radioactive waste treatment station named rwts the italians supplied a research scale radiochemistry laboratory capable of handling plutonium and an experimental fuel fabrication laboratory figure 6 shows a schematic of the site in about 1981 after these buildings were largely completed

5290965 the most passionate the wildest one might even say the most revolutionary advent hymn ever sung this is not the gentle tender dreamy mary whom we sometimes see in paintings this is the passionate surrendered proud enthusiastic mary who speaks out here this song has none of the sweet nostalgic or even playful tones of some of our christmas carols it is instead a hard strong inexorable song about collapsing thrones and humbled lords of this world about the power of god and the powerlessness of humankind
5290966 marys song reminds us that we can never ignore the suffering of others if we are to be true disciples of jesus in the increasingly individualistic world in which we live where there sometimes seems to be less and less willingness to reach out to others marys proclamation stands as a testimony to solidarity with the marginalized and the powerless it calls us not to passive hope but to action

5290975 nearly all our imports would have been affected and consumers and importers of raw materials would have benefited from lower prices as a result of the tariff cutting process
5290976 however on the other hand the cutting of tariffs would have meant government losing tariff revenue which is very important to any developing nation in this vein government will continue to levy duties to finance development programmes
5290977 for example it was agreed that countries with a tariff binding below 15 percent will bind 75 percent of their tariffs while those with a tariff binding above 15 percent will bind 80 percent of their tariffs
5290978 it was also agreed that preference receiving products will benefit from more favourable treatment while there was also a general consensus around the values of the co efficient for the tariff cutting formula for developed and developing countries

5291045 successful aging in a 70 year old man with down syndrome a case study
5291046 mr c paints an optimistic picture for people with down syndrome who are aging and says that an ordinary person with down syndrome ought to be able to make it to seventy once you find mr cs secret
5291047 the understanding in the field till very recently was that if you had down syndrome and were lucky enough to make it to 70 years of age then you would have to have alzheimers disease
5291048 but now we have mr c who clearly contradicts this longstanding assumption and offers a new benchmark and tremendous hope for all people with down syndrome to live longer and healthier lives

5291069 its not how young you are its how old you arent
5291070 while the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5291071 no that is not the case the 1970 camaro is in fact the first of the second generation camaros there might be some parts interchangeability with the 69 camaro but a 1970 camaro has more in common with a 1981 camaro or a 1976 nova platform wise than it does with a 1969 camaro
5291072 the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5291073 your point seems to be that they are basically the same car and then you try to explain it away by saying that you meant that they were both f body cars

5291077 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5291078 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5291079 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5291080 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up

5291085 these are serious matters its got to be real verification were trying to verify the amount of plutonium that they are declaring and in order to verify the amount of plutonium there are certain things you have to do and so i think those things are pretty internationally understood

5291103 chart music today is often so gloriously maximal that reproducing any of its thrills on limited means can seem an impossible task by paying attention to detail peter bjorn and johns bjorn yttling and lis prove that doesnt have to be the case but even more impressive is the way their intimate playful miniatures capture the daring and novelty of modern pop as well as its hooks
5291104 there are shades of bj rk and feist in her spacey voice which on her first album is paired with a raw electro pop score that makes tracks such as im good im gone and breaking it up 101 percent addictive and what about this trumpet in my headi pffffttt we can only hope she never makes enough money to move to los angeles to do pilates and timbaland
5291105 brimming with ideas but understated even tentative in executing them and big on hooks but nervously intimate in presentation youth novels is a curious decidedly unorthodox but endearing record both youthful and novel li was twenty one upon its release which may explain both her occasional goofy vocal affectations and the hesitant freshness of her hard to pigeonhole but refreshingly easy to enjoy

5291199 we now know that saddam has resumed his efforts to acquire nuclear weapons
5291200 the evidence indicates that iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program
5291201 simply stated there is no doubt that saddam hussein now has weapons of mass destruction there is no doubt that he is amassing them to use them against our friends against our allies and against us
5291202 saddam hussein would like nothing more than to use a terrorist network to attack and to kill and leave no fingerprints behind
5291203 each passing day could be the one on which the iraqi regime gives anthrax or vx nerve gas or someday a nuclear weapon to a terrorist ally

5291211 major improvements in cobalt product sales and continued increases in our radiochemicals segment have driven our improved financial performance this year we continue to improve our gross profit performance and reduce operating cost when compared as a percentage of total revenue in fact much of the increase in operating expense is attributed to the addition of full time staff subcontractors and legal counsel necessary to support continued growth of the fluorine products division including pilot plant demonstration and efforts related to equipment acquisition raising capital and protecting newly developed intellectual property all of those efforts are directed at furthering our long term goals and objectives of constructing a hybrid depleted uranium de conversion processing and fluorine extraction facility as announced in june 2008

5291215 the fda is out of touch with reality when they take common sense and distort it and try to limit it they overstep their bounds and become bureaucrats ignoring the science underlying their regulatory authority
5291216 stringent regulations and strict interpretation of procedural requirements are resulting in technological innovation being stymied rather than advanced
5291217 for the first time in history the fda has brought a suit on custom medical devices and lost
5291218 this sends a powerful message to the industry not to fear the fda or to be intimidated by their tactics power not only breeds corruption it also breeds arrogance and arrogance breeds stupidity
5291219 almost all of the leadership at the office of regulatory is leaving including associate commissioner of regulatory affairs margaret glavin who is retiring and assistant commissioner for compliance policy david horowitz who was recently promoted to assistant commissioner for policy for the fda deputy director deborah ralston has left the agency as well
5291220 the proposed merger between alyst and china networks presents a unique opportunity to participate in the rapid growth of the chinese media space we believe the transaction creates real value for the shareholders of alyst and provides china networks with the capital and capital markets access it needs to realize its potential
5291221 having been a tv station director of advertising and operated an internet and television advertising brokerage for nearly a decade i and my partners are all too familiar with the challenges inherent in the short term contracts and yearly re negotiations that are standard across the prc television advertising industry china networks has resolved those fundamental issues by aligning the stations interests with those of the ad carriers and the advertisers themselves our long term contracts effectively lock in and align our interests with the tv stations for both of our benefits
5291222 our merger with alyst as arranged by chardan allows us to increase the pace of our expansion accelerate efficiency improvements raise our industry visibility and bring significant value to our current and future partners and our shareholders in the process

5291240 paul krugman on income inequality in the u s krugman if you think that income inequality is one of the things that drives this i e motivates republicans and i do believe its part of the story then you have to look at the self reinforcing process in which growing concentration of wealth at the top feeds into the political power of the people who serve that classs interest i dont want to sound like a marxist here but theres some of that going on what we thought was an explosion of inequality in the reagan years was nothing compared to where we are now drum purely on an economic basis whats wrong with income inequality does it hurt and why krugman well i think you cant do it on a pure economic basis you have to think how it plays through the social system and the political process drum suppose it keeps going up what happens krugman one thing that happens is you have an adversarial kind of society you have a society in which people dont share the same lives at all dont share the same values politically it leads to erosion of the support for public institutions that we need

5291271 when you are playing mendis you have to save wickets and get runs as well it gets a bit tough even murali muttiah muralitharan was difficult some time back but mendis is a bit more unusual than him
5291272 its difficult to pick him mendis he is a very different bowler even if you pick him by the time you realise what ball it is it gets really late to play a big shot
5291273 in one day cricket it is not only about playing him but also rotating the strike because you dont want a bowler to end up with 10 overs for 20 runs we need to find a way to rotate the strike
5291274 i have not seen any bowler like him he is an unusual bowler the only option right now is to play more and more of him and thats the only way of getting better
5291275 we misread the wicket a bit there was a fair bit in the pitch for bowlers early in the match the sri lankans bowled really well as they got early wickets credit goes to them

5291282 some of our sandwich competitors use units that look like microwaves or toaster ovens to try and warm a few of their subs we have high end ovens in our stores that cost 30 000 and bake our sandwiches at 450 degrees it gives us a huge quality advantage they cant match
5291283 people fed up with brown bagging or driving to pick up something cold can save some time and gas by ordering a hot dominos sandwich for delivery to their home or office

5291325 global gesehen war das jahr 2007 ja eine regelrechte achterbahnfahrt die us immobilienkrise und der historische tiefstand an wohnungsneubauten in deutschland sorgten nat rlich auch im landkreis heidenheim f r eine starke verunsicherung im baugewerbe unser gutes jahresergebnis freut mich daher umso mehr
5291326 aufgrund der hohen investitionen von fast f nf millionen euro in die modernisierung und instandhaltung des wohnungsbestandes hatten wir f r das jahr 2007 mit einem minus von fast 700 000 euro gerechnet
5291327 unsere bereitschaft kr ftig f r unsere mieterinnen und mieter zu investieren ist der absolut richtige weg wie man sieht rentiert sich das gro e engagement der kreisbau im landkreis neuen modernen mietwohnraum anzubieten die kreisbau ist und bleibt damit der starke partner f r alle im landkreis wenn es ums wohnen geht
5291328 mit diesem wert liegen wir in baden w rttemberg mit an der spitze
5291329 wir h tten unsere h user doppelt und dreifach belegen k nnen der bedarf nach neuen wohnungen ist also absolut da
5291330 das haben wir als klares ziel ausgegeben und das setzen wir auch in zukunft konsequent in die tat um

5291342 over 15 200 families have received such support including seed since the beginning of the year
5291343 we allocate our resources according to need and recipients are always victims of armed violence in emergencies such as one in eastern drc our priorities include distributing relief to civilians who are often lacking basic necessities for survival thats why weve had to increase our budget and with it our ability to respond to emergencies
5291344 if we find that civilians need food we also try to provide corn oil and beans at a later stage when people are finally able to return to their villages we do our best to ease resettlement process we also assist families who are hosting displaced persons since population movements place great strain on resources of local communities
5291345 although we sometimes have to cut short an operation and leave we always do our best to return once access has improved as we did in masisi for example a few weeks after the initial attempt failed after all we have made a commitment to the people weve registered
5291346 icrc has made a financial and moral commitment to continue distributing food in the areas affected by the conflict despite rising food prices we have no intention of scaling down our work
5291347 if they are saying that it is because of security challenge it is the government that created the security challenge in the first instance by its actions and inactions so it should address the challenge and not ignite a fresh crisis
5291348 i think you should ask the vice president and other federal government officials from the niger delta to speak on it i actually dont want to speak on it
5291349 from the beginning the people of the south south have expressed their opposition to the former president olusegun obasanjos plan to pipe gas from the region to the olokonla plant between ondo and ogun states which he built to spite our people his regime could not however carry out the plan because our youths threatened to bow up the pipeline
5291350 we are opposed to it the escravos gas plant and the gas plant in bayelsa state should be developed instead of piping gas to lagos we want our youths to be employed in the gas plants in our region they need employment and it should not be taken to another area the federal government should drop the idea the people of the niger delta are strongly opposed to such a policy
5291351 in fact anything that will stop the people of the niger delta from benefiting form their natural resources should be avoided it is in doing this kind of things that the oil companies that operate in our region set up their head offices in lagos some of their workers even come to work in the niger delta from lagos at the end of the month they collect their salaries and pay tax to the lagos state government we are tired of all these type of things and that is why we said long ago that all the oil companies should relocate their headquarters from lagos to the niger delta
5291352 i dont know the mechanism they want to use but all i can tell you is that such a policy is not in the interest of the niger delta people you cannot be producing gas in the niger delta and be piping to lagos without developing our gas plants
5291353 in the first instance i want to tell you from the point of view of the iyc that it is impossible to pipe gas from niger delta states to lagos

5291363 he was a batsman in top form you can say gautam gambhir also got out initially we lost the top two performers of the test series in a way but that is the way it is now i think we may lose him for the entire series you never know
5291364 thats the way it goes in cricket you cant really stop and think about the guys you will be missing in the series rather than that you will have to fill in that space because that is the only way your team can win
5291365 it was a pretty good looking bunch of guys down there playing

5291375 i majored in architecture in college and design is how i actually started in for super max designing that prison it had to be the kind of thing that was a character in and of itself were in a world where instead of just trying to contain a guy whos really big youre trying to contain a guy who can in the case of icicle who can freeze things what kind of a cell would a guy like that need in order to have his powers neutralized so to escape from super max they have got to go through the most elaborate heist weve ever seen involving superpowers because the prison itself kind of has superpowers
5291376 the script is very true to the characters were not talking about putting nipples on the trapjaw suit but we had to come up with a reason again why trapjaw would actually not just be something thats totally absurd but why he would need those bionic parts added to him which gives a sort of sense of where the movie is going in some way

5291388 we dont want our people our teenagers influenced by their performance we want clean artists artists that are good role models
5291389 our neighbors were a big part of why we wanted so strongly to come back
5291390 we all rallied around each other and supported each other but it was also a matter of principle we were not going to let the storm chase us away
5291391 as most of you know i am not normally a patient man in the new world order here in new orleans we must learn the art of patience as the pace of recovery is much slower than we like we understand that this thing that happened was unprecedented and the recovery is an endurance test intuitively we know however that our persistence will pay off eventually for now like dorothy we dream of going home the ruby slippers have been delivered they simply are not ready for us to put on just yet
5291392 they didnt want anything that looked just like the next door neighbors home
5291393 it was refreshing to not have that as a design goal they wanted to embrace new orleans traditions and keep some elements of lakeview but not necessarily what they had before
5291394 wed originally wanted exposed rafters but that wasnt possible because of the sips
5291395 but oh well you cant have everything in post katrina new orleans
5291396 our prior home was a split level and we wanted a simpler setup with higher ceilings
5291397 our neighbor says it is a big red barn and that irked me at first
5291398 but then i realized she had made a cute apt description of our home its a big red barn with modern amenities it might be the only big red barn that has a steam shower a warmer tray and a six burner stove
5291399 i like simple functional design clean lines but with a rustic feel
5291400 think frank lloyd wright in the woods but robs style is clutter messy and only functional to him
5291401 i helped them select hard surfaces flooring cabinets windows doors and other interior architecture
5291402 the kitchen is what im proudest of i think its great porcelain floors reminiscent of slate and the rustic character maple cabinets
5291403 i never imagined i would have this much space to prepare meals it has been a delight inviting friends over to create meals together in the kitchen

5291407 we have no comments to make on the resignation of president musharraf of pakistan
5291408 deeply concerned about this vacuum because it leaves the radical extremist outfits with freedom to do what they like not merely on the pakistan afghan border but clearly on our side of the border too
5291409 like nature abhors a vacuum we abhor the political vacuum that exists in pakistan it greatly worries us
5291410 the removal of musharraf would result in the military playing a more autonomous role on issues of relations with india including policies on kashmir support for the taleban and control over nuclear weapons
5291411 we have never interfered in pakistans internal matters pakistan should do the same

5291435 a women who is abused by her husband is truly placed in a situation of double jeopardy regarding hiv infection in that his sexual behavior outside of the marriage makes it more likely he is infected with the virus and his abusive behavior inside the marriage leaves her with little control over sex or sexual protection
5291436 those clinicians working to prevent hiv infection among their female patients should consider violence from male partners as an important risk factor and ask about and attempt to intervene in such abuse to reduce this risk
5291437 more critically major national and global hiv prevention programs must include reducing mens ipv perpetration as a key target in the fight to stem the epidemic
5291438 this study should serve as a wake up call to us all if we as policymakers and practitioners are going to be truly successful in addressing the spread of hiv in india we must think of ways to address the all too widespread mistreatment of wives
5291439 there are not that many single drug targets that are mutated so frequently in cancer and that are in classes of enzymes where we know how to make a drug
5291440 pi3 kinase is one of these targets and thats why it is sky high on the list of exciting new targets in cancer
5291441 we were surprised by this result so we said okay if the gatekeeper in pi3 kinase is not the functional equivalent of the gatekeeper in protein kinases lets look at some other sites
5291442 what the result says is that maybe resistance will be a little bit harder to come by than in protein kinases so thats an advantage for those trying to make pi3 kinase drugs
5291443 and it may not be that hard to come up with other compounds that inhibit cancers that become resistant
5291444 the most direct implication of this work is that it teaches people that there are resistance mutations that are going to come up and you may as well try to come up with drugs against this right now
5291445 there has long been an assumption that anemia of chronic disease is harmful because patients with anemia tend to fare worse
5291446 we suggest that this anemia is actually part of the bodys effort to heal itself so you would expect to see it in the sicker patients as such correcting the anemia with blood transfusion or drugs cancels out our own bodys beneficial and adaptive response preventing a sick person from being slightly anemic may be analogous to preventing a cold person from shivering or a hot person from sweating these are necessary adaptive responses to stress in our environment
5291447 we believe there is enough evidence to advocate restraint in the treatment of mild to moderate anemia of chronic disease
5291448 we also believe that there is a great need for further research in this area and we hope that by raising these questions we will stimulate that
5291449 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
5291450 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain
5291451 no evidence sufficient to support the claim that an observed association between abortion history and mental health was caused by the abortion per se as opposed to other factors
5291452 global statements about the psychological impact of abortion can be misleading
5291453 help disentangle confounding factors and establish relative risks of abortion compared to its alternatives

5291455 it was an advantage to be more anxious in a dangerous environment
5291456 this single gene variation is potentially only one of many factors influencing such a complex trait as anxiety
5291457 still to identify the first candidates for genes associated with an anxiety prone personality is a step in the right direction
5291458 it might be possible to prescribe the right dose of the right drug relative to genetic makeup to treat anxiety disorders

5291509 quando la carta mi tagli il dito lo alzai per esaminare il danno dalla ferita invisibile colava una minuscola goccia di sangue poi accadde tutto molto velocemente edward si lanci verso di me scagliandomi dallaltra parte del tavolo ero caduta vicino al pianoforte gettando le braccia in avanti per proteggermi in mezzo alle schegge di vetro affilate dal polso al gomito ormai il dolore minvadeva acuto e bruciante confusa e disorientata cercai di non badare al rosso vivo del sangue che mi colava dal braccio e incrociai gli sguardi eccitati di sei vampiri improvvisamente famelici
5291510 nel silenzio assoluto unintuizione improvvisa rimise ogni dettaglio al suo posto cera qualcosa di cui edward non aveva voluto parlarmi qualcosa che jacob non mi avrebbe tenuta nascosta qualcosa che aveva attirato i cullen e i lupi nella foresta e li aveva fatti avvicinare pericolosamente tuttavia stavo aspettando proprio quel momento lo temevo ed ero pronta ad affrontarlo malgrado desiderassi con tutta me stessa che non arrivasse mai ma i miei guai non potevano aver fine vero

5291532 the sri lankan bowlers bowled really well the top two batsmen they got out not due to a bad shot they got out of their defence the credit goes to their fast bowlers i think they got wickets
5291533 later on ajantha mendis put the pressure and the only thing we were doing was to catch up and it really gets tough in the one dayers if you lose too many wickets upfront
5291534 if you see muralitharan and mendis they are different bowlers

5291551 las indumentarias de los j venes sus peinados o sus tatuajes
5291552 otros recursos como un volumen alto o un tempo de la acci n acelerado
5291553 hay pocos ejemplos en los que se oiga un insulto

5291555 la publicidad intenta tomarle el pulso a lo que sucede en la sociedad pero en lo ling stico no lo refleja tambi n la transgresi n est mejor expuesta en otros c digos
5291556 si los j venes de los anuncios hablasen como en la realidad todo el mundo se echar a encima no se aceptar a como un espejo de la realidad

5291566 it will make it such a heightened experience for the audience and for us to cast a real life soldier a veteran and bring him into our created drama
5291567 its a very delicate subject to begin with theres so much about the individual person thats going to help us create the character and whatever they bring and whatever their challenge is will be fit into the story
5291568 the audience embraces it because they relate to the people involved who they care about
5291569 theyre great at drama but there are many nuances that can be left out without getting the reality from the troops themselves
5291570 i was getting kind of fatigued but i knew everybody was counting on me
5291571 i was tired but this is what they want to see they want to see if youre going to push through it so i tried to go out there and push through the fatigue
5291572 he will be involved in that decision at the end absolutely
5291573 weve got 13 available offensive linemen for the next two games i think tennessee had 12 available when we were in camp with them and when i was at minnesota we would quite often go into training camp with 12 offensive linemen so assuming we dont have any more injuries at this point we should be ok there
5291574 i know they are great fans but there are also people i will say for a minute that i read message boards and got caught up in that whole thing
5291575 that even put more stress on me just worrying about what people thought about me people say a lot of times i dont care what people think about me me personally i dont care how people perceive me when they look at my hair but i like people to think great things about shawn andrews but you cant please the world
5291576 i have a better feel for osullivans abilities with the two games weve played
5291577 the other way hasnt worked around here for the last five years

5291580 he knows he still has a long way to go
5291581 its good for ted he went out there and competed at a high level
5291582 my biggest mistake as a coach is i make assumptions that these guys might know or have been through some of these experiences and that happened a little bit in the preseason opener
5291583 there were a few unique things that happened and they just caught us by surprise because when you look at these guys they didnt play very much last year
5291584 primarily in theory were basically starting over at this position
5291585 he says whenever hes missed training camp before i think two or three times maybe hes always had the best seasons of his career

5291588 with a nordstrom it turns from a powerhouse into a trophy
5291589 the plymouth meeting and voorhees malls were probably going to go dark or would undergo a significant decline without the work theyre doing there
5291590 they have a big pipeline of redevelopments that are opening in the next year or so at a time when retailer appetite for opening new space is pretty low
5291591 it was a pretty solid bet that if you built the mall you got two department stores to decide to go into a piece of property and you put a bunch of stores in between them you enclosed them in air conditioning that you know youd just sit back and clip coupons right not a bad deal
5291592 they built the court adjacent to that property i think thats a good example of a mall owner that has grown with the times now its just a juggernaut thats very difficult to compete against
5291593 whats the first thing that king of prussia got to sort of kick it off
5291594 they were very diligent about their approach to the market

5291602 i think i broke a tile in the toilet my hand just slipped and i heard a crack and didnt look back

5291612 theyre trying to put all of this stuff into whats really a very small town and i just dont see it fitting in here the way they want it to
5291613 i understand that this is overwhelming for a little community like this
5291614 but that just underscores the point that if youre going to build these big buildings here you have to know what youre getting into and be prepared for that
5291615 it was a great place and we loved living there
5291616 but if i were looking for a new apartment now thats the last place id look
5291617 get going as soon as we are authorized to do so
5291618 i felt that you really needed to have more than office space down by the river you needed to have people living there
5291619 see something in the distance that would attract them down to the river

5291664 deep commitment to and involvement in violent jihad by promoting it inciting others to take part in it and arranging for himself and others to attend military training in pakistan in preparation for going to fight and inevitably to kill

5291668 he had documents providing detailed information on surveillance and counter surveillance
5291669 this information amounted to a terrorist encyclopaedia or library that would have enabled him or others to carry out terrorist attacks here or abroad in a variety of ways and thereby further the cause that appeared to be his mission in life the war on western values and anyone who was a non believer in the muslim faith

5291678 let there be no doubt these are dangerous individuals these men were not simply in possession of material which expressed extremist views they were also in possession of material that was operationally useful to anyone wishing to carry out an act of violence or terrorism

5291680 while these men may not have been actively planning acts of terrorism themselves they sought to insight others for terrorist purposes promoting al qaida ideology and training programmes
5291681 in many respects khan muhammad and munshi were facilitators they had the knowledge required to orchestrate terrorist acts and they willingly shared that expertise with others these are not the actions of curious individuals or even those who are sympathetic to terrorist objectives they are the actions of people who pose a very real threat to our communities

5291894 the key message for employers is to not misread the unprecedented high levels of happiness for long term genuine engagement hr as a profession is facing some very serious challenges at the moment and employers need to be seen to be tackling those challenges head on if that doesnt happen employers leave themselves open to losing a lot of their best talent

5291930 uncle suresh is behaving strangely and i need your help to reclaim him
5291931 why what do you mean by strange how strange have you lost him to someone else to reclaim him now you better tell me your problem from the beginning
5291932 strange is a gross understatement his behaviour during the last six months has been weird irrational and infuriating he is driving me mad quite often
5291933 why dont you take him to a shrink i see lots of them have set up their clinics in the town
5291934 they are all theoretical and dogmatic i want some sane advice from an experienced person like you
5291935 he spends half his free time before the mirror he looks at me often quizzically making me doubtful of his thoughts
5291936 he looks as though he is wondering whether he made the right decision in teaming up with me
5291937 i thought you two were bound by strong bonds of love which you formed in your b school days
5291938 i also think the same way but he seems to doubt his decision now he is now ogling most of the young women brazenly
5291939 what do you think brought this sudden change in him have you been irritating him in any way by any chance
5291940 he talks strangely as if the whole world is out to get him he criticises everyone right from the prime minister to his immediate boss he even shouted at the milkman i wonder whether he has picked up some personality disorder or persecution complex somewhere
5291941 they are not contagious diseases or infections to be picked up go on continue and tell me more
5291942 of late he has been showing more interest in other women and less in me why he didnt even say a word when i wore a nice new and expensive ensemble from a boutique earlier he used to compliment me and smother me with you know what
5291943 i understand how do you know he has been taking interest in other women you women are prone to go by hearsay evidence and doubt your spouses
5291944 she snubbed and almost slapped him of course but it seems he is also making a nuisance of himself and insufferable to other ladies in his office why i even heard one of them complaining to me
5291945 now the problem seems to be serious how long have you been married how is he behaving with you
5291946 we have been married eight years he has always been a loving husband for the last six months he has been blowing hot and cold some times he is his usual self all loving and full of care otherwise he is brusque and brushes me off as though he is swatting a fly
5291947 prashant is 28 already he is got a good job has booked a flat and also has a car its time we should find him a suitable match
5291948 he is a very nice boy whoever marries him will be very lucky you have brought him up quite well otherwise boys of today dont ask
5291949 we have got his horoscopes checked the astrologer says that the right position of guru will fall next year which would be the ideal time for marriage but it all takes time think it is appropriate to start the search now
5291950 there had been some action at home over the week but preoccupied with his job prashant did not pay much attention
5291951 we have been thinking that you have been overstressed with work rightly so because you work in a big position in a very big company
5291952 you are now settled in life you need to have somebody to come back home to all of us have to reach this stage sometime in life

5291962 vidhya i heard you have some flower pots on your terrace why dont you show them to prashant
5291963 i dont remember exactly where but i think have seen you before
5291964 yes i also come for walking in the park every day morning
5291965 it is important that the couple get to know each other well before taking a decision it is not our times when i did not even know prashants grandpas name until i saw our wedding invitation
5291966 we are a very frank family before we start this off formally we want to share some important facts about our family we do not want someone to come and give you a messed up version tomorrow and consequent misunderstandings
5291967 vidhya has an elder sister we had fixed up her marriage three years back with a doctor after engagement he got a posting abroad and wanted to leave with her since she runs a school for special children here which is her passion she did not want to leave the country and her school and hence broke the marriage she refused to get into another alliance and we respected her freedom to follow her heart

5291974 i have spoken to them maha has agreed to meet you tomorrow morning at 7 00 am at the park where you go for walk every day
5291975 i am very happy to hear that you still remember me and want to take my hand i agree with you that two years is a very small period and would pass in no time i dont mind waiting for you not just two years but for eternity but then i dont feel from deep heart that you really loved me from deep within your wish to marry me was to take advantage of the coincidence which happened in your life to accomplish your unfulfilled desire and nothing more if you had loved me all this while i dont think you would have been stealing glances at my sister every day at the park or willingly agreed to marry my sister at the first opportunity available for our relationship to sustain it is more important for me to trust your for love me i dont think that faith is established i appreciate your proposal but am not feeling sad to refuse since i believe that i am not your suitable match and by not taking this forward i am doing good to both of us

5291985 john mccain should ask obama to join him in a town meeting on lessons from russias aggression both candidates favor nato membership for georgia and ukraine perhaps vladimir putins next victim but does russias behavior cause obama to rethink reliance on soft power dialogue disapproval diplomacy economic carrots and sticks which putin considers almost an oxymoron does russias resort to military coercion and its arsenal of intercontinental ballistic missiles cause obama to revise his resistance to missile defense obama unlike mccain believes russia belongs in the g 8 does obama think russia should be admitted to the world trade organization does obama consider putin helpful regarding iran mccain must convince voters that obamas complacent confidence in the taming abilities of soft power is the effect of liberalisms scary sentimentalism about a dangerous thing human nature and a fiction the community of nations mccain is hardly the change many people have been eagerly waiting for but putin is part of the change we must confront until russian tanks rolled into georgia it seemed that not even the democratic party could lose this election but it might if mccain can make it turn on the question of who is ornery enough to give putin a convincing deterring telephone call at 3 a m
5291986 whatever the political outcome of russias invasion of georgia the incident has reminded american voters that in uncertain times it is dangerous to choose a rookie with no foreign policy experience and a juvenile approach to world affairs over one tempered by war who understands that u n resolutions might as well be written in disappearing ink john mccain knows that peace through strength is what defeated the soviet union and that its peace through strength that will best preserve free nations and advance their interests
5291987 our military strength is a prerequisite to peace but let it be clear we maintain this strength in the hope it will never be used for the ultimate determinant in the struggle thats now going on in the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills and ideas a trial of spiritual resolve the values we hold the beliefs we cherish the ideals to which we are dedicated
5291988 the prevailing wisdom 18 months or so ago was that invading iraq had been in retrospect a disastrous blunder it had led to appalling sectarian fratricide and an ever climbing body count iraqi democracy was deemed a naive pipe dream worst of all it was said the fighting in iraq wasnt advancing the global struggle against islamist terrorism by rallying a new generation of jihadists it was actually impeding it opponents of the war clamored loudly for pulling the plug but what if we had known then what we know now we know now that the overhauled counterinsurgency strategy devised by general david petraeus the surge would prove spectacularly successful driving al qaeda in iraq from its strongholds and killing thousands of its fighters supporters and leaders we know now that us losses in iraq would plummet to the lowest levels of the war with just five americans killed in combat in july 2008 compared with 66 fatalities in the same month a year ago and with 137 in november 2004 we know now that the sectarian bloodletting would be dramatically reduced with numerous sunni tribal leaders abandoning their former al qaeda allies and shiite radical moqtada mahdi army being thoroughly routed by the iraqi military we know now that by the summer of 2008 the iraqi government would meet all but three of the 18 benchmarks set by congress to demonstrate security economic progress and political reconciliation and we know now that far from being undermined by the campaign in iraq the wider war against islamist violence would show significant progress with terrorism outside iraqs borders having in fact gone way down over the past five years as newsweeks fareed zakaria noted in may and with popular support for jihadist organizations plummeting across the muslim world so what does hindsight counsel today that iraq is a pointless quagmire or that it is a costly but winnable war in which patience tenacity and smarts have a good chance of succeeding
5291989 the reaction of the american left to john edwardss sex scandal is nothing short of flabbergasting since when is sex outside of marriage a disqualifier for merely speaking at a political convention since when is having sexual relations with that woman in your office anything wrong since when do we judge the difference here seems to be that elizabeth edwards has cancer so only fatal disease makes the bonds of marriage sacred although the last thing i want to look to be doing is making excuses for adultery what he did was wrong the john edwards incident begs americans to look in the mirror if we think what john edwards did with rielle hunter is wrong why do we think its wrong because marriage is at the foundation of our society and we should do what we can to protect every last one or simply because having fun while your wife is fighting a fatal disease is a lousy thing to do i dont know how we can condemn john edwards when americans have been known to cheer for cheaters in movies watch celebs do it all the time as a form of perverse entertainment and even insist were not sure what exactly marriage means
5291990 barack obama as shelby steele has written departs from the jesse jackson al sharpton brand of politics in that he is far more sophisticated and subtle in how to play on white guilt and how to intimidate thats new but the liberal content and agenda is not new and this blacks continue to buy en masse the points conservatives have been hammering home for the last 20 years have not been for naught there is increasing awareness among blacks how family breakdown is driving the social problems of the community this is not lost on obama his speeches paying credence to the importance and relevance of personal responsibility are well received among blacks but also play well to the whites he wishes to reach but the program behind the words remains comfortably lodged on the far left big government answers for everything redistribution of wealth use of law as a tool for politics liberal abortion policies and legitimization of the gay agenda the relevant question is will black politics black uniform support for liberals ever change
5291991 it is painfully clear that racism is alive and well in america unfortunately liberals use race gender class and religion as tools to further segregate our society all the while convincing minorities that they are discriminated against besides what ever would people like jesse jackson jeremiah wright louis farrakhan et al do for a living if minorities were no longer oppressed
5291992 one two three four we dont want your racist war five six seven eight we will not cooperate
5291993 its not a war on terrorism its a war of terrorism neo imperialism you know that money is the reason america is killing for oil not for freedom
5291994 a program that existed to spread lies and deception in reaction to the revolutionary movements of the 1950s and 1960s
5291995 i always had this inability to stand by and watch injustice being perpetrated
5291996 if those guys werent trying to cater to record labels wishes their music would be more conscious
5291997 against the war in iraq against homelessness starvation and other major issues thats actually what hip hop has the power to fight against influence and change
5291998 the highest form of consciousness is the understanding of the interconnectedness of all things living and non living
5291999 everything depends on everything else and we are responsible for our participation in that process
5292000 i wanted to do this because we have a community thats coming and going and this is a time to come out and see and meet everyone
5292001 when i was a kid growing up there were very few things that i can say were memorable there were a lot of days here in killeen that i just kind of went through like i did yesterday and the day before that so i wanted to create this as a wholesome memory for people to remember years from now
5292002 as a kid whenever anybody asked me what i was going to be when i grew up my answer was always a garbage man
5292003 i thought it was cool to pick up the trash and have the machine crush it and on top of that if people were throwing stuff out then i could get free stuff so i looked at it like a win win situation
5292004 when youre driving to killeen and you take 190 from i 35 and you get to the top of dog ridge theres nothing like getting to the peak of that hill and looking into the valley and seeing nolanville harker heights and killeen
5292005 it always feels like home and this is where i need to be to make a difference
5292006 from that point i asked the principal to move me to the alternative school and it was really challenging at first but theres nothing that makes my day better than working with kids
5292007 theres always an uncertainty where you know what youre planning on doing but you never know how its going to turn out and when i come into the classroom im not only the leader in the room but i have to use my intellect to reach out to these kids any adult can get into a room full of kids and give out orders but to actually reach their minds and get them thinking new ideas is a different story and a challenge that i love figuring out day after day
5292008 just like with everything thats out there hip hop has its unflattering commercial gimmicks that are just fads but theyll fade away sooner or later hip hop isnt always about making money getting the girl and drug dealing and just because someone listens to hip hop doesnt mean theyre a drug dealer or that they degrade women
5292009 its important for me to help people disassociate hip hop with all the things it isnt but is commonly mistaken for it isnt just music its a way of life and a culture
5292010 and just like society it changes and what it is today is not exactly what youll see tomorrow
5292011 i try to tell other artists to be true to who they are and to invest in themselves just like in life if youre not willing to put anything in then you wont get anything out
5292012 and you are who you hang with so if you align yourself with people who are constantly smoking drinking and free styling in a circle then guess what youre going to be 30 years old smoking drinking and free styling in a circle the rest of youre life
5292013 whether i win or lose the impeachment the nation will lose

5292334 we saved the world i say we have to party
5292335 we found that if a teacher has a high achieving group of students pushing them harder by giving them more homework could be beneficial
5292336 similarly if a teacher has a low ability class assigning more homework may help since they may not have been pushed hard enough but for the average achieving classes who may have been given too much homework in an attempt to equate them with the high achieving classes educators could be better served by using other methods to improve student achievement given these students abilities and time constraints learning by doing may be a more effective tool for improvement
5292337 there has been an extensive amount of research examining the influences of students achievement but it has been primarily focused on financial inputs such as class size or teachers credentials
5292338 our study examined the affect that additional homework has on test scores
5292339 this does not mean that homework is unimportant for average achievers
5292340 but it does mean that this population may also benefit from other activities such as sports art or music rather than additional hours of math homework
5292341 in my own personal experience i see that each semester requires a different approach
5292342 this is even true when i teach the same course twice in a semester different times of the day or lengths of classes require different methods just as different quality students require different approaches
5292343 teachers should consider quality over quantity when it comes to homework assignments
5292344 in the end it should be up to the individual teacher to decide how to motivate and educate their students
5292345 more and more labs are showing that people have the sensitivity for skills that we thought were only expert skills
5292346 the uva study shows that listeners without formal musical training but with sufficient exposure to a certain musical idiom perform similarly in a musical task when compared to formally trained listeners
5292347 the number of times that a physician will deal with a surrogate decision maker is growing as our population ages and conditions such as alzheimers disease become more common the issue of how physicians interact with surrogates is a very important one we found that physicians often want to take an active role in determining what is right for a patient and often grapple with the needs of the patient versus those of the surrogate
5292348 i always think its important that its not a decision that the family member or the surrogate is making for themselves but it is a decision that they are making for someone else based upon their best knowledge of what that person would want
5292349 when i feel strongly that the patients quality of life is really poor then i do feel that it is appropriate for the physician to try and guide the family member toward a decision
5292350 if the patient cant make the decision then i discuss it with the family i sometimes will push the family to do what i think is best for the patient
5292351 i think family burden is an issue i dont think it should govern what the final decision is but i do think it should be addressed
5292352 everyone figured that the acaricides anti varroa mite chemicals would be present in the wax because the wax is reprocessed to form the structure of the hives
5292353 it was a bit of a shock to see the levels and the widespread presence of these pesticides
5292354 we already had in place ways to test for viruses bacteria and fungi but it was difficult to find an analytical laboratory that could analyze for unknown pesticides
5292355 we needed them to take a comprehensive look at all pesticides not just those associated with beekeeping
5292356 when we began doing this work honey was not regularly analyzed and bee pollen was not a commodity and so was not analyzed
5292357 we decided to go with the types of screening the lab does for milk and apples which look at over 170 pesticides now honey is included in the commodities to be analyzed
5292358 simplicity was important because there were many people across the country sampling for us
5292359 now rather than having them collect 15 grams of pollen they need only collect 3 grams
5292360 gamma radiation is often used to kill viruses and other disease causing agents
5292361 we are finding fungicides that function by inhibiting the steroid metabolism in the fungal diseases they target but these chemicals also affect similar enzymes in other organisms
5292362 these fungicides in combination with pyrethroids and or neonicotinoids can sometimes have a synergistic effect 100s of times more toxic than any of the pesticides individually
5292363 we do not know that these chemicals have anything to do with colony collapse disorder but they are definitely stressors in the home and in the food sources
5292364 pesticides alone have not shown they are the cause of ccd we believe that it is a combination of a variety of factors possibly including mites viruses and pesticides
5292365 we now want to look at small versus large operations and organic versus nonorganic operations to see if there are differences
5292366 the problem in applying stereotype threat to uk medical students is that the majority of ethnic minority medical students here are from south asian backgrounds and it is not fully clear whether negative stereotypes exist about that group
5292367 the aim of the study was to establish if negative stereotypes about that group do exist and thus if stereotype threat might be one reason that uk ethnic minority medical students are underperforming academically
5292368 the fact that these negative stereotypes exist raises the possibility that stereotype threat may be occurring
5292369 its clear from our results that more research needs to be done into the effects of stereotype threat in uk medical schools and in fostering positive educational relationships between all students and their clinical teachers

5292397 how dreadful are the curses which mohammedanism lays on its votaries besides the fanatical frenzy which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog there is this fearful fatalistic apathy the effects are apparent in many countries improvident habits slovenly systems of agriculture sluggish methods of commerce and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the prophet rule or live a degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement the next of its dignity and sanctity the fact that in mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property either as a child a wife or a concubine must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of islam has ceased to be a great power among men individual moslems may show splendid qualities but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it no stronger retrograde force exists in the world far from being moribund mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith it has already spread throughout central africa raising fearless warriors at every step and were it not that christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science the science against which it had vainly struggled the civilization of modern europe might fall as fell the civilization of ancient rome

5292401 de vraag is of de islam wel in overeenstemming te brengen is met de liberale democratie en de vrijheid de verdraagzaamheid de verscheidenheid en het tegensprekelijk debat zonder dewelke geen open samenleving mogelijk is is de zaak rushdie niet het ultieme bewijs van de onmogelijkheid van de islam zich in te passen in onze samenleving toont zij niet aan dat de islam in wezen een intolerante en totalitaire ideologie is die botst met de culturele morele en juridische voorschriften die gelden in een open en democratische samenleving

5292443 results are now in for the first year of this new dwi court and they show an impressive trend
5292444 before dwi court a very large percentage of repeat dwi offenders were likely to go back to their old ways to the danger of us all
5292445 now through dwi court many offenders have gone on to productive lives holding down good jobs while repairing their family rifts
5292446 once repeat offenders have been admitted into the program they are placed on a rigorous schedule of judicial supervision for at least 18 months

5292454 seriously yes were still here and working hard on getting alan wake for you to enjoy sure weve been in development for a long time and if everything had gone perfectly smoothly there probably would be a game out for you guys to play already but designing a completely new game can be hard and sometimes you need to take a detour to find the best route forward

5292461 my second choice was madison square garden but i probably would have made more money in las vegas
5292462 at least for the fans its a lot easier cheaper and quicker to get to new york

5292633 his excellency and fellow brother mr mohammed bin eissa and his excellency mr khaled al nasseri saudi minister of communications brothers and sisters and honorable audience peace be upon you it is a great pleasure to address you from this location which for centuries has represented a bridge for communication and dialogue between civilizations and cultures assilah this noble city in our arab history hosts an annual festival that is among the most important cultural events in the arab world i wish it prosperity and success always it gives me immense gratification to welcome you here this evening to celebrate the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the assilah cultural forum the forums anniversary also coincides with the 30th anniversary of the founding of the pan arab international daily asharq al awsat newspaper which was established three decades ago in response to an urgent and pressing need to serve expatriate arabs living away from their homeland and keep them updated on their regions news through balanced reporting that is aimed at all arab citizens not just one state whilst taking advantage of the technological advancements to ensure that it is printed in various cities worldwide i believe that any observer following up on the history of arab journalism and its developments over the past 30 years would find that asharq al awsat occupies a leading position of considerable impact on the progress of the arab press brothers and sisters the saudi research and marketing group pioneered in becoming the first arab media group to be listed in the saudi stock market this development took place in the aftermath of the great successes achieved by the groups publications including asharq al awsat newspaper srmg possesses an integral structure of large scale equipment robust financial standing and strategic partnerships with international media institutions and it has not overlooked the preparation and development of its media cadres moreover the prince ahmed bin salman applied media institute was officially inaugurated in riyadh three months ago the srmgs board of directors and its major shareholders have taken the initiative to establish an institutional system to manage the groups activities in accordance with international standards to ensure equitable management therefore on this occasion it gives me great pleasure to announce a decision that represents a qualitative leap in the arab media industry that will entrench the general trend in which market forces and commercial considerations do not dominate over the editorial capacity in media and its aspirations the board of directors and the srmgs major investors are aware of the necessity of ensuring the stability of a balanced journalistic approach whilst protecting the media message and policies adopted by the group in addition to guaranteeing professional independence through the creation and appointment of an independent board of trustees the aforementioned board has recently been approved and the names of its members and details relating to its mode of operation will be announced shortly in the next few days god willing the board of trustees will consist of a diversified committee whose members are among the experts and specialized elite in various professional fields who will assist in assessing the editorial performance of all the srmgs publications in addition to evaluating the performance of the editors of all the groups publications and assessing their degree of commitment to the balanced editorial policies adopted by the group throughout the decades of its specialized media work this will ultimately give editors more professional independence with a clear separation between ownership management and the newsroom although the saudi research and publishing co embraces this unique method in arab media institutions and despite the board of directors knowledge and awareness that such an approach would entail withdrawing a number of powers granted to the board of directors and its chairman it comes through a recognition of the importance of the role played by the board of trustees and we will work to make the boards job a success moreover this approach is consistent with what is practiced by a number of international press and media institutions in europe and america dear colleagues i would not be adding anything new by saying that assilah cultural forum with its diverse cultural dimensions has achieved a striking success in fulfilling its goals and objectives the credit goes to the people who made this forum happen and to whom i would urge to document the success of this festival by compiling the events of the symposiums in a book peace be upon you and may you receive gods mercy and blessings

5292965 our results show that almost half of people questioned felt they had bought their endowment policy on a false promise this is not just a case of a small purchase this is thousands of pounds for a house that we are talking about
5292966 there are several reasons that somebody may have been mis sold an endowment policy including a lack of adequate explanation an endowment policy is not a short term commitment and this should have been made clear when the policy was bought as should the fees and risks involved
5292967 without this information people were unable to make an informed decision and should be able to claim some compensation depending on the circumstances
5292968 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

5292972 im going to ask identical questions to each of these candidates so you can compare apples to apples now senator obama is going to go first we flipped a coin and we have safely placed senator mccain in a cone of silence

5292977 with our previous telephony solution we often felt that important phone calls were missed due to our small workforce and travelling demands the gohello solution has overcome this as calls are now routed directly to employees mobiles our customers may not have noticed our new telephone system but that can only be a good thing by using gohello we dont need to worry about taking messages keeping the office manned or costly business calls leaving us to do what we do best running the business
5292978 was not done consistent with the usual standards of medical practice
5292979 o utside the scope of medical practice not for the defendants did not renew their objection to this testimony at trial but they raised it again when appealing their convictions to the
5292980 except as provided in subdivision b testimony in the form of an opinion or inference otherwise admissible is not objectionable because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact
5292981 no expert witness testifying with respect to the mental state or condition of a defendant in a criminal case may state an opinion or inference as to whether the defendant did or did not have the mental state or condition constituting an element of the crime charged or of a defense thereto such ultimate issues are matters for the trier of fact alone
5292982 that neither dr parran nor dr barkin ever claimed to know the defendants intent and so the opinions that they offered were not barred by rule 704 b
5292983 p articularly since the defense raised no contemporaneous objection we agree with this position though we note that portions of dr parrans testimony come close to a statement about the doctors
5292984 satisfied that dr parran did not testify regarding the subjective mental state of dr katz upon writing the prescriptions charged
5292985 during cross examination of dr parran defense counsel asked dr parran on three occasions whether he was purporting to express an opinion as to what dr katz might have had in his mind at the time that he wrote the prescriptions at issue in the indictment each time that he was asked dr parran denied doing so
5292986 that street level drug dealers typically sell very small quantities of cocaine and heroin which can be packaged in capsules bottle caps corner cut baggies or foils he also observed that even small amounts of drugs as in glovers case can be distributed if packaged in small enough quantities he explained that street dealers often maintain small stashes of drugs nearby for resupply rather than carrying all of their drugs with them finally coleman testified that firearms are common tools of the trade for drug dealers
5292987 w hen a law enforcement official states an opinion about the criminal nature of a defendants activities such testimony should not be excluded under rule 704 b as long as it is made clear either by the court expressly or in the nature of the examination that the opinion is based on the experts knowledge of common criminal practices and not on some special knowledge of defendants mental processes relevant in this regard though not determinative is the degree to which the expert refers specifically to the intent of the defendant

5293002 mccain had agreed to be in a cone of silence he broke his promise because of that fact we will probably never know whether or not mccain had any advance notice of the questions
5293003 when i see mccain smiling on tv i see an empty shell smiling at his own assumed greatness once the applause dies down and his smile fades away i see an imbecile how this complete nutcase has been able to be a senator for 26 years says more about the horrible political system than about mccain himself

5293005 is it too much of a stretch to think that an evangelical christian would make sure a republican candidate had the questions beforehand
5293006 there was only one christian and he died on the cross
5293007 i think its time we bring mccains character into question
5293008 its time people have been bringing both obamas and mccains character into question for months now
5293009 first of all anyone who thinks mccain cheated is implicitly admitting that obama got his ass handed to him
5293010 secondly if you actually watch the entire interview with warren youll find that he gave both candidates the general subject matter of the questions but not the questions themselves
5293011 why that mccain fella seemed to know what he was talking about

5293055 i bolt on road grader blades on the sides for protection and use a 4 gallon stainless steel gas tank where the back seat used to be
5293056 but it can shake you up pretty good i think it is like doing practice with the seahawks you feel it
5293057 i will spend that just in gas running around looking for parts and cars
5293058 its getting more difficult because the scrap prices are so high id like people to know that if they have a 1970s car to get rid of i just want to put a few more dents in it and they can have it back to give to the scrapper
5293059 the demo derby society is drowning because of the lack of cars

5293214 i think it all boils down to the motivation i dont think creativity should be motivated by success or even being seen by other people
5293215 in my life i work with a lot of people making beautiful losers was incredibly challenging there were some big fights and hurt feelings along the way for everyone involved the thing ive learned over the years is that you have to learn to collaborate with people that means really listening to people hearing from them finding out exactly where they are coming from and being able to give up things that are dear to you for the sake of the greater good ive found that in a healthy creative relationship if you give other will too and in the end you come up with something that pleases everyone involved
5293216 however if everyone isnt willing to do this you can run into problems
5293217 i guess ive learned that its all really not that important i know that sounds funny but after you have a good archive of projects under your belt the stuff that got you so stressed out at the time just seems silly in retrospect

5293247 but it really grew under rev baths leadership no matter what baggage you carried or what religious tradition you were from he made sure you were welcome
5293248 god has endowed us with the wisdom not to cower before the forces of nature but to rise up and control them

5293261 whilst operators understandably dont want to be perceived as trying to unfairly glean excess revenues from unwitting subscribers while abroad taking a one size fits all approach blocking their usage while abroad will result in them losing very significant revenues at a time when you would expect them to be looking to maximise their 3g network investments
5293262 operators need to take better control of their network assets so that they can offer a bespoke service to each user on a case by case basis
5293263 in a competitive european market where operators are increasingly trying to differentiate their service and the many millions of corporate subscribers are becoming increasingly international operators surely have no choice but to ensure they maximise all mobile broadband revenue opportunities whilst offering subscribers the best possible service

5293312 im going to help their ratings this is a breeze
5293313 in a long evening of pop pageantry syesha mercado like david archuleta with his king kingston medley showed american idol had in its possession something its biggest critics never would have dreamed possible soul
5293314 we do not like the truck they are always overloaded with some people standing up throughout the journey to make matters worse we usually leave our houses as early as 4 30am to wait for the vehicles there is no way we can complain about anything they tell us that if we are not happy with the job we can leave because there are so many people out there who are looking for the job
5293315 since this new union executives came into office we have been holding meetings with the company julius berger management and one of the issues in the agenda is to stop the use of the trucks to carry workers they have assured us that the vehicles would be stopped but as you know rome was not built in a day the management is actually making efforts to bring in better vehicles to convey workers
5293316 i recalled when former minister of the fct prof miriam ikejiani clark passed a directive that the construction companies stop the use of trucks to carry their workers
5293317 the conditions of the truck are not good and we hope that our company will see reasons why they must put a stop to it with this recent mishap
5293318 i am not aware of any fct minister who gave the directive but i can tell you that the trucks are very conducive although you have someone who may stand at the door it does not mean that the workers are made to stand it is very comfortable inside
5293319 registration has started although the process to register is a bit slow
5293320 i was here at 7am but one needs to be patient in order to complete the process because it takes over 30 minutes for one to complete
5293321 it is a bit slow to register but we hope to pick up as we go along
5293322 all of us stepped into this journey with great faith and great belief that humanity would carry us through from town to town and that is exactly what happened
5293323 for me to walk from leeds to london is probably the single most difficult thing i could ever have imagined
5293324 i still cant quite believe that i have achieved it but i never gave up because of the people that never gave up on me
5293325 in australia many people have helped us but just a few people is how can i say terrible my feel is australia is not a good place for overseas students
5293326 when i talk to some students about australian institutes and how is the education they provide to us most of the students will say no it is not education its just business
5293327 i feel stressed and depressed i just lie on the bed thinking thinking thinking i do not know how to explain it
5293328 id like to have as many children as my body will allow and id adopt if i still want more after that
5293329 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart
5293330 at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies but then samantha came onto the scene and i was dropped
5293331 i dont like talking about love and jinxing things but were having a good time and were very happy

5293337 its always controversial to be right when the governments wrong
5293338 we placated government for 10 years and it didnt get us any place the most important thing for people to realise is that government have their ways of doing things and business have their ways of doing things they arent always the same
5293339 i have a lot of people who come up to me in the street and say keep at it mate dont let them get you down mate
5293340 i suppose people are too polite to come up to me and say youre full of rubbish

5293369 the market looks to be slamming on the brakes hard
5293370 come in slightly below expectations which just reflects that the employment market is tightening
5293371 we should also show no surprise when the modern corporation favors unfocused group decision making over individual responsibility and management even when the end result is no result
5293372 in place of rigorous study and its attendant discipline students instead are being taught to rely on their feelings and opinions as though the untutored and callow sentiments of youthful inexperience are worth as much as thoughtful studied analysis
5293373 these folks are masters at insulating themselves from the competitive pressures that would bring about that result in any reasonable length of time
5293374 they were there to teach us useful information on how to make money
5293375 try and find a practical major in the undergraduate curriculum of harvard or yale
5293376 go to college or youre going to wind up flat broke in a single wide
5293377 if you cant get into a 4year college you are going to go nowhere in life
5293378 the certifications freinds lovers and drug connections you recieve and later use to make money
5293379 the military is hard sweaty they wont pay you enough theyll send you out to crappy places half way around the world to die in the name of imperialism
5293380 sounds like a good place to learn a thing or two
5293381 i had fun in college i did alot of stupid stuff but that was back when i was a young and stupid
5293382 one other thing i think a conservative believes is that the parents not government are and should be responsible for the upbringing and behavior of their children
5293383 the children may be at risk due to the parents behaviour and associates the parents might endanger the emotional well being of the children
5293384 what s to stop them from declaring gun ownership or hunting or going to church or home schooling risky behavior
5293385 if the parents are associating with criminals and exposing their children to them it doesn t matter under what guise or banner they feel is appropriate
5293386 the parents may in the future come to be a threat to the mental or physical wellbeing of the child
5293387 i know one little girl who has a tiny body but she speaks like an expert in the field of sex
5293388 i asked her why that is and the little girl answered me my mother is doing it the neighbours are doing it so why not me
5293389 when i met the child and came to see where she lives says beatrice i understood what it takes for a child to become like that i understood that she is completely psycologically damaged and that she has no self esteem left it is not her fault it is the fault of the environment in which she lives
5293390 they see themselves as nothing they lose all self respect as human beings who could have had the potential to live well in this world and the mother she might see herself as a victim of her gender and say im just a woman let me just live with whatever comes along she might also feel that her girl child has no position in the family to the mother having sex with different men is normal even when it happens to her child
5293391 part of the solution for children in this situation is empowering the mother
5293392 i would make her feel like she can do something better for herself and her child no matter what she has done in the past
5293393 for the past days alleged supporters of the slpp had been reportedly raining abuses on the newly elected mayor of freetown mr herbert williams allegedly calling him all sorts of names cocaine mayor wachenhut thief and other provocative descriptions ascribed to him this according to independent sources has been the regular salutation of the alleged slpp supporters to the mayor both morning and evening on tuesday 12th august 2008 the action of the alleged slpp supporters intensified when they reportedly blocked mayor herbert williams on his way to the office
5293394 wednesday morning 13th august 2008 without any knowledge that supporters loyal to mr herbert williams were fully prepared to defend the mayor if the alleged supporters put up similar actions as predicted so it happened when the supporters started making provocative comments and raining insults on the mayor loyalists retaliated accordingly

5293399 i often use samso as an ambitious example of how to cope with the big challenges that our own country faces in the race to become independent of fossil fuels
5293400 i think samso has set an agenda for the climate issue and alongside other projects it has shown that this is possible
5293401 we invested 84 million a big number for 4 000 people but in reality its not a whole lot
5293402 first of all you need determination and can do spirit and then you need an economic foundation to make it possible
5293403 we held a lot of meetings but we managed to do it because we hired good experts and trusted our own instinct
5293404 what is intriguing about samso is their ability to make this project a sport for them to show that this can be done
5293405 what were trying to learn is how to do it how to achieve that level of energy renewable self sufficiency that samso and the community here have achieved
5293406 using resources that are locally available and producing it in a way that is self sufficient for the island while exporting green energy is something many nations would love to see
5293407 by coming here you have to agree to abide by
5293408 what s happening here is that france is asking itself the hard questions the questions all the other western nations are either ignoring denying or subverting those questions are what exactly constitutes our society what defines our culture is that culture worth preserving if it s worth preserving how best do we preserve it what are the immediate ways we can change what we have done in the past that have damaged our society and culture
5293409 and we must therefore exterminate them and convert them to our way of life
5293410 without any of the behaviors or practices of that institution nor any attempted vestige thereof
5293411 islam may be stuck in the 6th century that s irrelevant it doesn t matter what century it is or whether it is considered bad in say saudi arabia what matters only is if it is allowed in western civilization men and women are given equal treatment before the law in western civilization is a statement of fact and policy without suggesting that saudi arabia can t continue to treat men and women differently under the law if they choose to in saudi arabia you just can t expect the customs practices of saudi arabia to be allowed in france
5293412 we have to destroy the west before the west destroys us
5293413 to lay and collect taxes duties imports and excises to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the united states
5293414 to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the powers vested by the constitution in the government of the united states or in any department or officer thereof
5293415 congress has not unlimited powers to provide for the general welfare but only those specifically enumerated
5293416 if congress can do whatever in their discretion can be done by money and will promote the general welfare the government is no longer a limited one possessing enumerated powers but an indefinite one subject to particular exceptions
5293417 retain the right to refuse to do business with anyone for any reason
5293418 say for example that there was a situation similar to new orleans where the police had disarmed only people who were roaming the streets people remaining in their houses which can be a requirement in an emergency situation would not be disarmed only those behaving in an unlawful looter like behavior the police wouldn t have the ability to arrest hundreds and hundreds of people so a stop gap would be to make sure they were unarmed that makes sense to me and i fear we ve lost something by removing from the police the authority to do that
5293419 thanks but no thanks youll have to pitch your tent elsewhere

5293622 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned
5293623 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
5293624 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
5293625 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
5293626 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
5293627 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
5293628 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
5293629 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
5293630 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
5293631 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
5293632 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
5293633 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same

5293648 the demand for the program came from australian farmers unable to find the labor to get their produce to market for australia families

5293674 we dont care whether mccain cheated or not all that matters is that he won stop being a crybaby
5293675 when i see mccain smiling on tv i see an empty shell smiling at his own assumed greatness once the applause dies down and his smile fades away i see an imbecile how this complete nutcase has been able to be a senator for 26 years says more about the horrible political system than about mccain himself
5293676 but nothing in the bible was written directly to you or specifically about what you face
5293677 the greater part of wisdom consists in understanding the relationships between complementary truths

5293679 you are angry entitled and manipulative and you need to learn how to love your wife and not be so self centered
5293680 how the vacuum is handled by the civilian government how much control they can exercise on the radical elements remains to be seen
5293681 we have no comments to make on the resignation of president musharraf of pakistan
5293682 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5293683 this action and dual use possibilities for their ballistic missile programme have been a subject of iaea discussions and are inconsistent with their un security council obligations
5293684 iran still has a long way to go as far as satellites are concerned and it deliberately exaggerates its air and space successes in order to dissuade israel or the united states from attacking its nuclear sites
5293685 it is clear that for years iran has had shihab 3 ballistic missiles which put israel within its reach but the threat posed by iran comes from its nuclear programme and not from its satellites or ballistic missiles
5293686 iranian experts can put the national satellite into orbit in the not too distant future
5293687 it was a suicide car bombing against the gates of the salerno camp
5293688 moments later a second car bomber came and wanted to detonate his bombs police identified him and opened fire on him

5293691 we looked up and it looked like lots of confetti falling out of the sky
5293692 a twin engined plane then came toward us falling all the time it was going to hit us or could have gone onto the housing estate
5293693 but i think the pilot must have realised what was going to happen because the plane then banked very very sharply like they do in those acrobatic displays
5293694 it the aircraft had been taking an entirely routine flight and was on a perfectly normal approach to land at coventry it was approximately two miles from the runway
5293695 we believe it had been cleared to land by coventry airport air traffic control when it was in collision with a smaller single engine light aircraft which was also hoping to land at coventry
5293696 we are conducting a joint investigation with the air accidents investigation branch and warwickshire fire and rescue service to try to find out what has happened

5293709 live nation benefits from the difficulty of replicating the live experience that casual and passionate fans pay for in good times or bad
5293710 started with control of the venues then used that to spread out into other areas of the music industry and by so doing its competing with the record labels
5293711 if live nation can get to the point where its paying on parity to what the labels are paying or even below that then it will be a great strategy

5293737 it was an innocent enough question how do scientists behave when no one is looking
5293738 a prominent australian scientist has examined two decades of work on ancient himalayan geology and alleges it may be the greatest paleontological fraud of all time
5293739 he was speaking specifically about how poorly many science journals have handled scientific fraud
5293740 after the initial inquiry by this congressional committee into this subject the committee has had growing reason to believe that we are only seeing the tip of a very unfortunate dangerous and important iceberg
5293741 for 20 years apparently deceived his colleagues concerning the origin of fossils that he submitted to them for their appraisal
5293742 made useless practically all the facts accumulated over the past 20 years on the geology of the himalayas
5293743 the contradictions of the knowledge which is not knowledge at all
5293744 the competition is savage winners reap monumental rewards losers face oblivion its an atmosphere in which an illicit shortcut is sometimes irresistible not least because the establishment is frequently squeamish about confronting wrongdoing
5293745 controls the largest source of research funding 5 6 thousand million a year from the national institutes of health
5293746 the scientific community shows little stomach for confronting its ethical dilemma
5293747 has been strangely reluctant to probe too deeply for hard data about its ethical conduct
5293748 isnt keen about cleaning house or even looking closely for malfeasance
5293749 is the house of science clean and in order the bit of evidence that reaches the public invites serious doubts
5293750 whats the major product of scientific research these days answer paper
5293751 hundreds of new journals are being founded each year to handle the flood of research papers cranked out by scientists who know that the road to academic success is a long list of articles to their credit
5293752 is symptomatic of fundamental ills including a publish or perish ethic among researchers that is stronger now than ever and encourages shoddy repetitive useless or even fraudulent work

5293784 the pursuit of freedom as defined in an age of consumerism has induced a condition of dependence on imported goods on imported oil and on credit the chief desire of the american people
5293785 is that nothing should disrupt their access to these goods that oil and that credit the chief aim of the u s government is to satisfy that desire which it does in part of through the distribution of largesse here at home and in part through the pursuit of imperial ambitions abroad
5293786 requires giving up on the illusions of grandeur to which the end of the cold war and then 9 11 gave rise it also means reining in the imperial presidents who expect the army to make good on those illusions

5293797 when we were very little george and i used to share a bedroom
5293798 as we got older he was given the room all to himself and after he left it was used by other family members but was always vacated when george returned home to visit
5293799 it was always known as georges room and our mum never let us forget that
5293800 everyone in the family is sad to see it go it was a very happy home and my father lived there for nearly 60 years but we all have our own houses now and it was a stipulation of dads will that the house should be sold on his death
5293801 we are honoured to have been instructed by the family of the late dickie best to market a piece of northern ireland history
5293802 mr best dickie lived in this house for 60 years the family first moved there when george was around two or three and george grew up there he wouldve kicked a ball for the first time in the back garden
5293803 he also came back there a lot to visit during the height of his success at old trafford
5293804 it would be the same price if mr and mrs smith had been living there

5293864 immigration hasnt been a central issue in past campaigns but thats changing this year
5293865 our platform on immigration is much better than the democrats its tying in to positions on globalization and free trade any free trade pact should have free passage over borders like in the eu
5293866 this will be a reflection of what the green party can offer minorities
5293867 the green party is not well known by latinos yet but this is an opportunity for the party
5293868 the mission was basically self deter mina tion for puerto rico and for the neighborhood
5293869 community empowerment and the whole question of puerto rico being a direct colony of the u s
5293870 prior to that no one had really fought back against the daley machine
5293871 a certain element was definitely not interested in dropping the drugs and the violence

5293873 gutierrez is very powerful hell probably harness most of the money but ill run a very grassroots campaign with the community groups soccer leagues churches
5293874 people see gutierrez as a champion of immigrants but the proposals hes put forth are far from that
5293875 i dont see immigration as a problem of national security where you need to militarize the border i see it as a labor issue as long as you criminalize immigrants and ignore their economic contribution youre shooting yourself in the foot
5293876 we are going to stumble on many latinos who will reject the green party because they joined the democratic party in search of privileges a job to be elected to a political position even to get some consulting and patronage contracts

5293881 virtually everything you hear about sharks is just so dramatically untrue
5293882 any great white or tiger shark could kill and eat a person every day at will if they actually wanted to but the truth is they dont we are all just suffering from jaws syndrome
5293883 the nursery of the eastern pacific these sharks belong here it is their habitat
5293884 how many summers of the shark are there going to be
5293885 no matter what anybody tells you we dont know why sharks attack people there just isnt any sound scientific evidence
5293886 then waikiki beach in hawaii would be the best place in the world for sharks to live because they could eat five or six people fat people every day but when we dive around there we dont see any sharks
5293887 if you were really hungry would you turn down even a crappy meal
5293888 we would still very much be in the dark ages about sharks
5293889 the bottom line is sharks just need better pr agents
5293890 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves
5293891 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them

5293895 i am just waiting to hold them in my arms and breast feed them
5293896 i dont know if i can do it to all but i will try
5293897 they are doing well but they still need a lot of care
5293898 what they need most is a dwelling to live in i hope the government will give them an apartment
5293899 with the help of allah they will make it but i think it will be difficult
5293900 ontario can only cover a little bit of the issues that are around uranium
5293901 the old mining act was brought into place before we had fully formed an idea of what citizens rights were all about and what aboriginal rights were all about
5293902 and we need to change this act so they reflect a modern understanding
5293903 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of a lot of the constitution
5293904 obama started to say that justice thomas didnt have enough experience for the supreme court
5293905 this is all reminiscent of senate majority leader harry reids comment several years ago that justice thomas was an embarrassment to the court and that his opinions were poorly written
5293906 apparently obama can do no better than to recycle discredited statements of harry reid when it comes to justice thomas like other liberal elites obama cannot stand it when a black man strays from the ideological plantation and refuses to implement liberal policies through the courts but obama will never point out any intellectual deficiencies in justice thomass work because he cant justice thomass opinions consistently reveal faithfulness to the constitution judicial modesty and deference to the will of the people in our representative democracy that is opposed to everything that obama and the liberals are trying to do in grabbing power from the people and giving it to the courts
5293907 well i think that the president of the united states has incredible responsibility in nominating people to the united states supreme court they are lifetime positions as well as the federal bench there will be two or maybe three vacancies this nomination should be based on the criteria of proven record of strictly adhering to the constitution of the united states of america and not legislating from the bench some of the worst damage has been done by legislating from the bench
5293908 even more troubling is what the illinois democrats answer betrays about his political habits of mind asked a question he didnt expect at a rare unscripted event the rookie candidate didnt merely say he disagreed with justice thomas instead he instinctively reverted to the leftwing clich that the courts black conservative isnt up to the job while his white conservative colleagues are
5293909 obama wants justices who will do his bidding who will implement the preferred policies of the liberal establishment not justices like thomas scalia roberts and alito who understand that the role of a judge is not to legislate from the bench
5293910 obamas answer about the three wisest people in his life upon whom he would rely heavily in his administration also sheds light on the way he would choose supreme court justices obama said he would consult his grandmother his wife and ted kennedy this is unlikely to yield the highest quality judicial nominees who understand the constitution and the role of judges in our constitutional democracy
5293911 a kick where the player jumps acrobatically facing the ball and dives forward to kick the ball with their heel
5293912 you never know how its going to end up but giving up those runs early wasnt a good thing to have happen
5293913 i felt like i made pretty good pitches it just didnt turn out my way
5293914 they just got them just enough to find a hole
5293915 i gave up the one hard hit to hairston but after that they were hitting them where i wanted them to and they just found the holes you can sit here and think about all that stuff and it doesnt change anything i tried to keep us in it as much as i could and it just didnt work out
5293916 youre not going to get him right out of the chute you learn from at bat to at bat and time to time
5293917 i threw the ball exactly in the same spot that he threw it to me
5293918 i wasnt trying to hit him it came in there more than maybe i wanted it to but thats baseball

5294155 die drastische situation die die russische seite zu einem raschen beginn der milit rischen operation in s dossetien zwang ohne dass sie nach dem georgischen berfall auf zchinwali br ssel informiert hatte f gt sich nicht in das format des russland nato rats ein dabei hat moskau eine eilige einberufung des rats gleich nach beginn der aktiven phase der kampfhandlungen vorgeschlagen
5294156 das zusammenwirken russlands mit der nato im bereich der planung der atompolitik und der politik der nichtweiterverbreitung ist in keiner weise mit den ereignissen in georgien verbunden und es ist offenkundig dass ein solches zusammenwirken fortgesetzt werden muss
5294157 genauso wie in den schwersten jahren des kalten kriegs die verhandlungen ber die nukleare abr stung zwischen der udssr und dem westen fortgesetzt und hierbei ernste abr stungsabkommen erzielt wurden

5294229 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5294230 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent senator obama

5294335 coloccini has only trained with the players once but when youve played 20 odd games for argentina coming to old trafford wont faze you
5294336 i just told him to go out and enjoy it which he did
5294337 he was saying it was very quick and that he could make more passes normally
5294338 i got a draw here with fulham once and in my first game here with newcastle we got a 1 1 thanks to an andy cole goal
5294339 but my main memory of that game is that nicky papavasiliou made the goal but we could not get his name on the back of his shirt
5294340 looking back at those other draws we came away and thought we were a bit fortunate
5294341 we gave a good account of ourselves and we caused manchester united a lot of problems
5294342 we had big hearts youve got to come here and have the courage to play
5294343 ive been here two or three times now and got draws but two or three times is more than some managers get in a lifetime
5294344 you get them by players going out there and feeling like they belong and that they are not just fodder
5294345 we go to arsenal in our next away premier league game and if we could go there and play the same way as we did at old trafford we might just get something there
5294346 a lot of times in football you get what you deserve but sometimes you dont
5294347 i was pleased it went wide from where we sat we didnt know where it had gone

5294349 possibly on the day and you wouldnt say this normally we had more of it than manchester united because of some of the personnel they had missing
5294350 last year it didnt work out and we got beat 6 0
5294351 shay given kept us in it early on with two great saves but after that we might have been talking about three points and a massive upset

5294366 i think that this is not exactly what was said in your talk
5294367 although ebola kills 9 out of 10 people outbreaks have so far been unable to become epidemics because they are currently spread only by direct physical contact with infected blood however a closely related virus that kills monkeys ebola reston is airborne and it is only a matter of time until ebola zaire evolves the capacity to be airborne

5294577 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5294578 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5294579 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5294580 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5294581 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
5294582 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
5294583 la pr ctica de los consejeros viola la ley ind gena 19 253 y los principios ticos al asumir posiciones vitalicias y patrimoniales sobre la conadi
5294584 nosotros queremos que el gobierno le d una soluci n a los problemas de tierra que tenemos en diferentes comunidades tambi n rechazamos la actuaci n de estos consejeros que est n imponiendo su derecho afirmando que el trabajo que ellos hacen es verdadero nosotros decimos que el gobierno est buscando un medio para buscar soluciones en estas comunidades
5294585 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
5294586 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
5294587 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
5294588 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
5294589 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
5294590 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
5294591 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
5294592 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
5294593 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
5294594 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
5294595 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
5294596 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
5294597 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
5294598 presidents are not elected by ballot they are selected by blood
5294599 would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union
5294600 people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5294601 we have to invent a new language with regard to russia that is what the european union is trying to do
5294602 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since august 7
5294603 russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia
5294604 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5294605 the document signed by mikhail saakashvili completely omits the opening sentence the introductory part it is an integral part of the document and when the leaders of south ossetia abkhazia and now russia have signed the document they signed an agreed version not some shortened or edited one
5294606 this weeks events in georgia have taken that outcome another major step closer and when you appreciate that if obama is elected in november then america is actually putting brzezinski and soros in the white house you can see the potential for global mayhem

5294618 we the illuminati worshippers of lucifer shall unleash the nihilists and atheists and we shall provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to the nations the effect of absolute atheism origin of savagery and of the most bloody turmoil then everywhere the citizens obliged to defend themselves against the world minority of revolutionaries will exterminate those destroyers of civilization and the multitude disillusioned with christianity whose deistic spirits will from that moment be without compass direction anxious for an ideal but without knowing where to render its adoration will receive the pure light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of lucifer brought finally out in the public view a manifestation which will result from the general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of christianity and atheism both conquered and exterminated at the same time

5294648 banyak pemimpin yang melukai hati masyarakatnya dengan melupakan amanah seperti melakukan korupsi dan sistem kepemimpinannya belum mengayomi akibatnya terjadi krisis kepercayaan masyarakat terhadap pemimpinnya
5294649 calon calon pemimpin yang diusung partai politik diharapkan memiliki kualitas intelektual dan moralitas yang tinggi agar masyarakat tidak salah pilih atau terpaksa memilih karena tidak ada pilihan lain yang lebih bagus
5294650 masyarakat mengambil sikap tidak memilih karena sudah terlanjur menilai bahwa pemimpin itu tidak mampu mengemban amanah yang diberikan rakyat

5294719 it makes no sense for american taxpayers to keep paying for reconstruction projects in iraq when iraq has a large budget surplus and is capable of paying for its own projects iraq doesnt need the money but we do iraq is making big profits on its oil sales and were still paying the bill for their reconstruction projects that makes no sense to me
5294720 is perpetual war our future learning the wrong lessons from the bush era
5294721 sen obama has pledged to end the u s combat role in iraq a necessary step if we are to restore realism and good sense tou s foreign policy yet we should temper our expectations about exactly how much change obamas election would represent in key respects his differences with sen mccain are operational rather than strategic mccain describes iraq as the central front in the global war on terror obama insists that afghanistan is the central front implicitly affirming that global war will continue to frame u s national security what the campaign needs but does not have is a viable candidate to challenge the assumption that open ended global war or as styled by the pentagon the long war offers a viable response to violent islamic radicalism a serious foreign policy debate would be one that entertained strategic alternatives
5294722 i think its imperative that the following step be taken the president should have already and should do so very quickly convene the presidents working group on financial markets thats something that he can ask the secretary of the treasury to do this has to be coordinated across markets with the regulators here and obviously with regulators and central banks around the world
5294723 t he banking problems in the united states continue to mount while the federal governments deficit continues to soar out of control
5294724 when central banks intervene in the currency markets they exchange their currency for dollars
5294725 on july 16 2008 the federal reserve reported holding 2 349 billion of us government paper in custody for central banks in its report released today this amount had grown over the past three weeks to 2 401 billion a 38 4 annual rate of growth so central banks were accumulating dollars over the past three weeks at a rate far above what one would expect as a result of the us trade deficit the logical conclusion is that they were intervening in currency markets they were buying dollars for the purpose of propping it up to keep the dollar from falling off the edge of the cliff and doing so ignited a short covering rally which is not too difficult to do given the leverage employed in the markets these days by hedge funds and others

5294805 there are 15 people all with the same substance this is the strangest thing because it leads to the conclusion that there is an organized effort
5294806 there is an organized crime because that is what this is called
5294807 because it seems there is a lot of money hidden there a lot of profit
5294808 i am neither a policeman nor a detective nor a judge
5294809 i dont have that knowledge and i think that the time has come for the state to do something and find a solution i believe that if they want to they will find it and i believe they do want to
5294810 whoever does such things gets mixed up in such things commits suicide and when someone wants to commit suicide nobody can stop them
5294811 of course it has to be organized when there are so many cases with the same substance
5294812 supplied to the naive because someone who knows that this could lead them to death doesnt try it
5294813 as for fani it is a fact that they went after her i love fani very much it was wrong for her to allow those who fought her to be vindicated

5294839 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personnality
5294840 concept behind the creation of jpmorgan chase has broken down
5294841 no steel company can sell steel when auto manufacturers arent selling cars and no bank can make big profits when theres a weakness in the housing and credit markets
5294842 they have to ride out the cycle minimize the losses and maximize profits when the cycle returns you cant restructure a company to avoid that cycle
5294843 in 1985 there were 14 500 banks in the u s and now theres 7 200
5294844 for the past 23 years six of them went away each week the big universal banks might get hit but they stay in business and come out with a bigger share of the market than they had before
5294845 it is considered too sexy for us its not good for viewers in malaysia
5294846 we dont want our people our teenagers influenced by their performance we want clean artists artists that are good role models
5294847 oil prices to fall in q4 and q1 next year oil has peaked for next few years
5294848 the u s is nowhere near the bottom of the housing slump
5294849 home prices in the u s are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
5294850 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5294851 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5294852 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5294853 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5294854 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5294855 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5294856 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5294857 ronaldos ripped body slicked back hair shiny white teeth and jewelery swung the votes his way he looks like any gay man or womans dream

5294859 we were very passionate until lindsays fear of being found out drove us apart the news of the world
5294860 at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies but then samantha ronson came on to the scene and i was dropped
5294861 she was staring daggers at her all night while lindsay and sam cuddled in a booth i guess there are still hurt feelings between them
5294862 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5294863 today the shadow of dictatorship that has prevailed for long over this country that chapter has been closed
5294864 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5294865 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5294866 i pray the government stops this downward slide and takes the country out of this crisis
5294867 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual
5294868 that is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership
5294869 pakistan and the united states have a joint interest in fighting terror
5294870 thats what were concentrating on that and helping pakistan to sustain its economy to build its schools its health we have a broad pakistan policy
5294871 i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5294872 the promise gods purpose and plan for when life hurts
5294873 the access to this website is prevented by its owners free will
5294874 people just get used to lose their freedom this experiment is trying to shock people by trying to show them how it would be if sites got banned so fast i think it would increase the awareness of people very well
5294875 sometimes we love people so much that we have to be numb to it because if we actually felt how much we love them it would kill us

5294908 die bewegungen sind von gef rderten stellen also insbesondere von arbeitsgelegenheiten beeinflusst
5294909 arbeitsmarkt juli 2008 bei genauer analyse kein grund zum jubeln
5294910 their latest offering of found sound scavenger hunt stylized schizophrenic video game soundtrack perfection
5294911 jubilant but slight in a way that suggests much of supreme balloon would have been a lot more fun to make than it is to listen to that certainly applies to an ambient title track that goes nowhere beyond wiggly test tones for 24 minutes a long time to go nowhere no matter the concept
5294912 the seething lake of evil slime beneath the city sogo in the 1968 film
5294913 this reminded of the scene from that film where jane fonda is trapped by the evil genius in the sort of whole body organ which tries to play pleasure her to death youll either know the scene or you dont im not going to try to explain it any further
5294914 man kann immer kl ger werden ist doch sch n wenn man lernt
5294915 after youve mentioned greed sadism megalomania and general insanity how many other motives are there
5294916 knocking over a bank is a faster way to make money than anything honest i could be doing
5294917 there are some awfully anal retentive laws against torturing people so ill just have to wear a mask to make it harder to track me down
5294918 the end justifies the means and that man deserves to die so anything i do to cleanse the world of his presence is fair game
5294919 what good is it having all this power unless you can exercise it to the fullest possible extent to reshape the world around you
5294920 it wasnt my fault your honor ever since the unfortunate acid bath ruined my complexion and twisted my sense of humor i just havent been myself
5294921 obviously its my destiny to reshape the world the way it ought to be and if a few people or a few thousand people or a few million people have to die along the way to a new world order then so be it you cant make an omelet without breaking a few eggs
5294922 a fanatic is a man who does what he thinks the lord would do if only he knew the facts of the case
5294923 hey if i kill off all the nastiest violent criminals in a way that makes a big media splash then perhaps other people will realize that crime really doesnt pay and will clean up their own acts and the whole world will become a much better place
5294924 well i suppose this l guy is entitled to his own silly opinions sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me
5294925 hot tempered fanatical villain whos a threat to everyone and needs to be taken down as quickly as possible
5294926 i regret that i have but one life to give for my country in a worst case scenario and if i first have to sacrifice your life for my country thats just tough
5294927 a relic of the cold war who was already an adult operative in the bad old days
5294928 i know what im doing is against the local laws and i know its probably immoral to boot but im not ready to die just yet
5294929 why should i rot in a prison cell or maybe even face the death penalty for something i didnt do no matter what the judge and jury said
5294930 respecting the legal code rules made by other people as your social duty
5294931 i have to make noises like a villain in order to complete the mission but it will all come right in the end
5294932 how could i be an agent of interpol or the cia or any of those other agencies when ive already killed so many important people in so many different lands you dont really think any of those stuffy western bureaucracies would take such horrible risks do you
5294933 i couldnt help myself my thinking had been twisted inside out by the real villain and i thought i was doing the right thing
5294934 oh yeah another chance to hack and slash and dodge bullets and leap from rooftops and outwit security systems and outrun cops and prove im the roughest and toughest operator in the business if i couldnt do this three times a week i think id blow my brains out from sheer boredom
5294935 ill do this by the book the way my parents taught me

5294944 with a nordstrom it turns from a powerhouse into a trophy
5294945 the plymouth meeting and voorhees malls were probably going to go dark or would undergo a significant decline without the work theyre doing there
5294946 they have a big pipeline of redevelopments that are opening in the next year or so at a time when retailer appetite for opening new space is pretty low
5294947 it was a pretty solid bet that if you built the mall you got two department stores to decide to go into a piece of property and you put a bunch of stores in between them you enclosed them in air conditioning that you know youd just sit back and clip coupons right not a bad deal
5294948 they built the court adjacent to that property i think thats a good example of a mall owner that has grown with the times now its just a juggernaut thats very difficult to compete against
5294949 whats the first thing that king of prussia got to sort of kick it off
5294950 they were very diligent about their approach to the market
5294951 we sent a truck to crate amp barrel in king of prussia and we bought a table chairs silverware dishes place mats lamps occasional chairs
5294952 loaded it into the truck drove it to cherry hill

5294962 fakt ist gegen clever eingef delte betrugsversuche ist kaum ein kraut gewachsen wenn was im konkreten fall ja noch nicht bewiesen ist die anrufe der call center vorrangig nicht erfolgten um lose zu verkaufen sondern um an kontodaten zu gelangen hat man von seiten der datendiebe erfolgreich auf die gutgl ubigkeit der opfer spekuliert hier m ssen die aufkl rung der verbraucher und die warnung vor unlauteren vorgehensweisen im mittelpunkt der pr vention stehen in diesen punkten erf llen verbraucherorganisationen eine wichtige aufgabe beitragen zu mehr sicherheit k nnte im brigen auch der gesetzgeber in dem er auch hierzulande die bislang vergeblich von datensch tzern geforderte meldepflicht bei datenverlusten in ffentlichen stellen und unternehmen einf hrt fakt ist aber auch datendieben kann man es viel schwerer machen als dies gemeinhin geschieht wenn die verbraucherzentrale schleswig holstein diesen vorfall mit der aussage es sind nur ein paar mausklicks und solche daten k nnen kopiert per mail versandt und somit sehr schnell ffentlich zug nglich gemacht werden kommentiert dann liegt etwas im argen in der art und weise wie die daten gespeichert werden selbst das seri seste unternehmen das mit sensiblen informationen seien es sozial arbeits oder kontodaten hantiert kann seine mitarbeiter nicht jederzeit und an jedem ort kontrollieren um sicherzustellen dass mit diesen daten nichts unrechtes geschieht abhilfe schafft hier mit relativ wenig aufwand und bar jeden eingriffs in die arbeitsroutine eine durchg ngige und konsequente verschl sselung der digitalen daten denn dateien die verschl sselt auf einem datentr ger sei es die interne festplatte des computers eine cd oder dvd oder einer der beliebten usb sticks gespeichert sind verf gen quasi ber eines der sichersten digitalen vorh ngeschl sser der welt ffnen kann dieses nur wer legitimiert ist zudem wird bei einer durchg ngigen verschl sselungsinfrastruktur jeder datenzugriff protokolliert was abschreckend auf gelegenheitst ter wirkt und zielgerichtet arbeitende datendiebe schnell enttarnt dieser diebstahl h tte sich vermeiden lassen w ren die daten verschl sselt gewesen denn dann h tten die diebe lediglich eine menge f r sie wertloser weil nicht lesbarer bit und byte erbeutet und keine missbr uchlich nutzbaren daten
5294963 auch wenn in deutschland bislang nur wenige f lle von datenklau an die ffentlichkeit gelangt sind sollten unternehmen sp testens jetzt ihre eigenen informationssysteme auf potenzielle datenlecks untersuchen und eine umfassende sicherheitsstrategie einleiten
5294964 die meisten entscheidungstr ger deutscher unternehmen sind nach wie vor der meinung dass sich solange im eigenen betrieb nichts passiert ist der aufwand von allumfassenden sicherheitsma nahmen nicht lohnt diese auffassung ist jedoch falsch
5294965 ein mitarbeiter kann sensible daten in sekundenschnelle per mail verschicken oder auf einen usb stick ziehen ohne dass jemand etwas davon mitbekommt auch wenn die transaktion sp ter auff llt ist der schaden dann meistens schon angerichtet
5294966 dabei darf man mitarbeitern nicht immer b swillige absichten unterstellen vor dem hintergrund von t glich hunderten versandter e mails und zeitmangel sind viele beispielsweise gar nicht in der lage alle inhalte und anh nge ihrer elektronischen post l ckenlos vor dem versenden zu berpr fen die meisten mitarbeiter sind sich auch nicht dar ber im klaren dass eigentlich gel schte inhalte in word oder sogar in pdf nachtr glich wieder sichtbar gemacht werden k nnen
5294967 risikomanagement reduziert sich bei vielen it unternehmen h ufig noch auf virenscanner und firewalls dabei kann intelligentes und strategisch geplantes risikomanagement gerade in diesem bereich mit relativ wenig aufwand gro e sch den vermeiden
5294968 paessler l sungen erm glichen einen effizienten einsatz von ressourcen bei der planung und umsetzung von strategien zur risikominderung sie bieten permanent detaillierte einblicke in alle kritischen und damit f r die gesch ftsprozesse relevanten netzwerkbereiche
5294969 we are still under the second republic maldives has not declared a third republic
5294970 upon the commencement of this constitution the constitution of the republic of the maldives which came into force on 1 january 1998 shall be repealed
5294971 the 1998 constitution has been repealed it doesnt exist any longer and now we are acting on a completely new constitution the term i continue to serve is not under the current constitution
5294972 violates spirit of democracy and the decision of the people for a presidential system with limited terms
5294973 given the short time period ahead of the election and given the lack of an establishment of a supreme court the maldives reform movement believes the advice of experienced experts is very important

5294993 anche a nome degli oltre 5 000 operatori della polizia ferroviaria che ogni giorno sono in servizio sui treni e nelle stazioni per garantire la sicurezza ai cittadini che viaggiano esprimiamo solidariet piena al macchinista e rls dante de angelis che ha denunciato i problemi legati alla rottura degli eurostar e alla manutenzione i problemi legati alla sicurezza dei convogli e alla manutenzione sono noti anche agli operatori della polizia di stato che i treni li frequentano per servizio e del resto alcune inchieste portate avanti da autorevoli giornali confermano che problemi esistono anche la magistratura a quel che ci risulta sta indagando su alcuni recenti incidenti
5294994 si mantengono tutte le caratteristiche strutturali degli anni precedenti spiega la responsabile dellindagine sulle condizioni delle famiglie dellistat linda laura sabbadini in condizioni peggiori le famiglie con tre o pi figli
5294995 ad una pi ampia diffusione del fenomeno si associa una maggiore gravit le famiglie povere presentano una spesa media mensile di 752 01 euro lintensit del 22 5 per cento contro i 797 62 e 806 35 osservati per il nord e il centro
5294996 negli anni sta crescendo il livello di inattivit femminile e quindi ci sono sempre pi famiglie monoreddito
5294997 la presenza di occupati e quindi di redditi da lavoro spiega sabbadini non sufficiente a eliminare il forte disagio dovuto alla presenza di numerosi componenti a carico soprattutto quando si tratta di working poor cio di persone che percepiscono un reddito basso
5294998 es kommt uns allerdings gar nicht auf die menge an sondern auf die erweiterung unserer kompetenz
5294999 durch accessec otaris lsec und voice trust haben wir qualifizierte mitglieder hinzugewonnen die unsere position weiter st rken teletrust ist der ansprechpartner in deutschland f r alle fragen rund um die it sicherheit
5295000 neben dem networking ist die f rderung der sicheren nutzung von it systemen in deutschland die hauptmotivation uns bei teletrust zu engagieren
5295001 ber die organisatorische vernetzung mit den gro en und kleinen organisationen in teletrust werden wir als unternehmen sichtbarer und k nnen das thema it sicherheit besser in den kmu anwendungsbereichen vertreten

5295047 pharmaceuticals in the water pose no health risk to citizens
5295048 the recent media scare surrounding pharmaceuticals in the water may have caused alarm for some citizens but not for ocwd
5295049 we know we are being exposed to other peoples drugs through our drinking water and that cant be good
5295050 the question is what is the impact of injecting very minute concentrations of all sorts of different compounds into the ground water i dont think anyone can answer that question right now
5295051 for more than 70 years ocwd has proactively monitored and tested its groundwater recently the district began testing a limited number of monitoring wells in areas near its recharge and seawater barrier operations that would most likely contain pharmaceuticals the results in these areas revealed extremely low trace levels parts per trillion of pharmaceuticals these levels are more than 100 times lower than the most conservative safe levels determined from studies conducted around the world
5295052 while researchers do not yet understand the exact risks from decades of persistent exposure to random combinations of low levels of pharmaceuticals recent studies which have gone virtually unnoticed by the general public have found alarming effects on human cells and wildlife
5295053 so much is unknown many independent scientists are skeptical that trace concentrations will ultimately prove to be harmful to humans theres growing concern in the scientific community though that certain drugs or combinations of drugs may harm humans over decades because water unlike most specific foods is consumed in sizable amounts every day
5295054 our bodies may shrug off a relatively big one time dose yet suffer from a smaller amount delivered continuously over a half century perhaps subtly stirring allergies or nerve damage pregnant women the elderly and the very ill might be more sensitive
5295055 manages the large groundwater basin that provides reliable high quality groundwater to 20 cities and water agencies and their 2 3 million customers in northern and central orange county
5295056 as the federal government and state agencies and university scientists study this we may find we have two parallel tracks for what compounds we are worried about
5295057 i think were going to see different thresholds of concern this is a discussion thats going to go on for a long time
5295058 weve been exposed to toxins for eons but the thing thats different today is the number of kinds of chemicals our bodies are exposed to every day
5295059 in the 1960s the book silent spring was concerned about a couple of hundred chemicals today were being exposed to tens of thousands of chemicals every day and that soup is so complex
5295060 its our job to try and figure out which ones we need to pay attention to and as scientists were doing that but were trying to catch the horses after theyve been out of the barn and running around for decades these chemicals are released into the environment with little understanding of their ecological impact or public health impact we know almost nothing about what happens when they mix
5295061 adding yet another measure of security the new state of the art gwr system enables ocwd to provide the highest quality water it can obtain to refill the groundwater basin the three step water purification process microfiltration mf reverse osmosis ro and ultraviolet light uv with hydrogen peroxide generates near distilled water that exceeds all state and federal drinking water standards ro is a key step of the purification process which removes any dissolved minerals viruses and pharmaceuticals in the water ocwd is proud of its commitment to provide reliable high quality water

5295064 we found that if a teacher has a high achieving group of students pushing them harder by giving them more homework could be beneficial
5295065 similarly if a teacher has a low ability class assigning more homework may help since they may not have been pushed hard enough but for the average achieving classes who may have been given too much homework in an attempt to equate them with the high achieving classes educators could be better served by using other methods to improve student achievement given these students abilities and time constraints learning by doing may be a more effective tool for improvement
5295066 there has been an extensive amount of research examining the influences of students achievement but it has been primarily focused on financial inputs such as class size or teachers credentials
5295067 our study examined the affect that additional homework has on test scores
5295068 this does not mean that homework is unimportant for average achievers
5295069 but it does mean that this population may also benefit from other activities such as sports art or music rather than additional hours of math homework
5295070 in my own personal experience i see that each semester requires a different approach
5295071 this is even true when i teach the same course twice in a semester different times of the day or lengths of classes require different methods just as different quality students require different approaches
5295072 teachers should consider quality over quantity when it comes to homework assignments
5295073 in the end it should be up to the individual teacher to decide how to motivate and educate their students
5295074 one of the most beautiful things about america to me is the creativity that we instill in our primary and secondary schools
5295075 i know that we lag behind many countries in test scores but i believe we also produce some of the most creative enthusiastic students in the world

5295098 evidence was put before the director of public prosecutions last night and the decision was taken to charge two men a 17 year old and a 20 year old
5295099 a number of individuals were detained and questioned this week as a result of a proactive police operation
5295100 consequently some have been charged with drug related offences unconnected to the mullanys murder
5295101 at this stage we are not in a position to disclose any further information regarding these individuals
5295102 so far as the two females arrested and charged last week they are still remanded in custody at her majestys prison
5295103 again we are not in a position to disclose any details regarding their arrests and charges except to say they are linked to the other three persons presently in police custody
5295104 he didnt have to worry about how his answer would be perceived he didnt have to work to recall his talking points he didnt have to think or even try to look like he was thinking all he had to do was blurt out what he believed clearly this gave him an unfair advantage and we think the american people will see this for what it is another republican smear tactic

5295112 against the unilateral declaration of independence of serbian province of kosovo and metohija
5295113 extremely suspicions of the intentions of western powers due to their overwhelming pressure and stubborn insistence to sever the province from the rest of serbia
5295114 during its history scotland has had far more grounds to be granted independence but it was not allowed to secede what could possibly be the difference between my homeland and kosovo to create such a precedent now
5295115 what could possibly be the difference between my homeland and kosovo

5295118 for a long time people kind of got use to going to the doctors and filing a claim now its like we want the whole bill upfront
5295119 we are like any other business we have to collect our money to pay our bills its far easier to collect upfront than to go after someone on the back end

5295157 als een van de bewoners neervalt wordt er met reanimatie gestart ondertussen wordt gekeken wat de wens van de bewoner is mocht tijdens de reanimatie blijken dat iemand eerder heeft aangegeven niet gereanimeerd te willen worden dan zullen we deze wens respecteren en de reanimatie alsnog stoppen
5295158 ik voel me nog steeds erg verbonden met mijn eigen kindertijd
5295159 als ik schilder ben ik niet hier maar d r het is verschrikkelijk als iemand me stoort wanneer ik aan het werk ben dan ben ik zo geconcentreerd dan is het net of je uit een boom valt heel raar
5295160 dan ga ik er echt helemaal n als ik daar fiets moet dat huis dan links staan of is rechts leuker
5295161 vroeger had ik boeken waarin een slaapkamer getekend was met alleen een bed erin of een keuken met daarin een kraan die maar n knop had maar zo is het niet in werkelijkheid een slaapkamer heeft wel een bed maar ook een nachtkastje met een kleedje en daarop vaak een medicijntje of in ieder geval een lampje en een kraan heeft niet n maar twee knoppen een voor warm en een voor koud water als kind legde ik zulke boeken weg het klopte niet en dus was er niets aan
5295162 ik zeg niet dat prentenboekmakers die nooit aan kinderen denken dus autonoom bezig zijn niet mogen bestaan maar zelf denk ik altijd aan kinderen
5295163 ik voel me nog steeds erg verbonden met mijn eigen kindertijd
5295164 ik wilde heel graag een boek over sinterklaas maken zonder fratsen dus niet over mutsen die niet passen of bootjes die omkieperen
5295165 ik was zo bang dat er een jongetje zou zijn met een vader die op een stoomboot werkt dat die zou zeggen die boot klopt niet en dan afhaken
5295166 dan ben ik tenminste ook van al die cavias en konijnen af
5295167 ach het is zo relatief er zijn heel veel goede illustratoren en heel veel mooie boeken van mij mogen ze wel meer dan n penseeltje uitdelen
5295168 maar ik zou het wel heel moeilijk vinden je kunt van jezus niet zomaar een gewone man maken dat is echt heel moeilijk
5295169 wie geeft er nu een boek uit dat je maar drie vier weken in het jaar kunt verkopen en dat bovendien zo nederlands is dat het niet aan andere landen verkocht zal worden
5295170 de enorme werking van bachs magistrale meerstemmige mismuziek komt door het contrast met het afwisselend gezongen eenstemmige gregoriaans nu sterker dan ooit naar voren muziekwetenschap en muziekpraktijk kunnen samen tot heel bijzondere luisterervaringen leiden zo blijkt een bekende bach komt hierdoor als nieuw tevoorschijn
5295171 ik ben niet het type dat met de ellebogen werkt om ergens vooraan te staan om dat ene nieuwsmoment vast te leggen veel liever ben ik met mensen bezig wat houdt hen bezig hoe zijn ze wat maakt hen zo bijzonder daarom maak ik ook graag trouw en vriendschapsreportages het liefst fotografeer ik de mensen in de omgeving waarin ze leven zodat er een goed totaalbeeld ontstaat daarbij gaat het overigens wel degelijk om de keuze van het moment om de juiste belichting
5295172 ik had tijdens de opleiding al een paar fotoseries in elspeet gemaakt onder meer over het boerenleven mijn docenten vonden ze heel goed en omdat ik hier veel contacten heb besloot ik mijn afstudeerproject ook over elspeet te doen ik probeer weer te geven hoe de plaatselijke samenleving eruitziet met speciale aandacht voor het landelijke en kerkelijke leven want dat is het meest typerend voor elspeet
5295173 ik heb mezelf een jaar de tijd gegeven om alle aspecten van het leven in elspeet vast te leggen oogst toerisme catechisatie jaarwisseling koninginnedag noem maar op mijn afstudeerdocumentaire is een soort samenvatting van het project ik ben nu bezig om de witte vlekken in te vullen zo wil ik nog graag de laatste zes melkveeboerderijen van elspeet fotograferen in gedachten ben ik constant met dit project bezig ik heb heel sterk de neiging om lles vast te leggen maar dat kan natuurlijk niet
5295174 ze dubben eerst wat er is schroom om op de foto te gaan dat is ook wel begrijpelijk want ik kom heel dichtbij in hun persoonlijke leven uiteindelijk vinden de mensen het meestal wel leuk daarbij speelt mee dat ze mij kennen het is belangrijk dat je als fotograaf vertrouwen hebt ik merk dat de mensen heel open zijn naar mij toe
5295175 er zijn dingen die je gewoon niet kunt fotograferen en dan houdt het op maar in de kerk betrap ik mezelf er wel eens op dat ik denk tussen die twee hoeden door zou ik een prachtige foto van de dominee kunnen maken ik denk dat elke fotograaf wel zoiets heeft
5295176 ik had met de ambtsdrager afgesproken dat ik vlak voordat hij zou gaan bidden heel snel twee fotos zou maken als de catechisanten de ogen al hadden gesloten onder het gebed zelf zou ik dat niet willen doen maar dit geeft wel aan voor welke dilemmas je kunt komen te staan een documentair fotograaf mag het beeld niet manipuleren of in sc ne zetten de mensen moeten h n verhaal vertellen ik registreer slechts
5295177 de blokhut is een stukje van het verhaal als documentair fotograaf moet ik eerlijk blijven ik mag de werkelijkheid niet mooier voorstellen dan ze is dat wil niet zeggen dat ik alles zonder meer weergeef ik hoef de zonde niet uit te vergroten daarom zal ik caf of discotheek nooit als los onderwerp kiezen binnen het grotere geheel van mijn project kan ik dat wel verantwoorden daarbij is het wel zoeken naar de juiste aanpak omdat het onderwerp gevoelig kan liggen in zon kerkelijk dorp ik zou bijvoorbeeld alleen de silhouetten van bezoekers kunnen weergeven
5295178 omdat ik een wat tijdloos document maak wil ik er graag een mooi boek van maken dan heb ik ook de ruimte om alle aspecten van het leven in elspeet aan bod te laten komen ik ben nog op zoek naar een uitgever
5295179 daar heb ik tijdens mijn opleiding over nagedacht waar kan ik mijn fotos publiceren ik heb acht christelijke documentair fotografen ge nterviewd om voor mezelf vast te stellen of ik mijn fotos ook aan niet christelijke kranten en tijdschriften kan aanbieden uiteindelijk ben ik tot de conclusie gekomen dat ik verantwoordelijk ben voor mijn eigen product en niet voor de verdere inhoud van een blad
5295180 the only true solution to the kosovo issue is not for pri tina or brussels to force kosovo serbs and belgrade to accept the self declared independence or god forbid another war but inter ethnic dialogue between the serbian and albanian people through which the two people can raise their concerns to one another in a civilised and non abusive manner
5295181 maybe as a anarchist you should consider either entity as legitimate i dont know as im not an anarchist but surely you should recognise the rights to self rule of those who live in kosova as much as the rights of the people who live within the borders of serbia proper
5295182 right side the side of democracy and a european serbia

5295189 the doctor said well it looks like hes got all the symptoms of west nile virus
5295190 i called the state health department because i needed to know how long he was going to be sick
5295191 i was just bawling i thought he was going to die
5295192 he was diagnosed with epstein barr virus which is pretty much the same thing but you dont die from it
5295193 i dont blame him because all the doctors are doing it
5295194 id like to know how many people have been told they have west nile
5295195 this has been going on since west nile came into utah some doctors will base things on symptoms and not do tests
5295196 like any medical test they can be expensive and if people dont have insurance then sometimes the doctor will go ahead and try to help the patient
5295197 whether theyre helping or not may be something of a question
5295198 he said well it sounds like youve got west nile
5295199 it was really strange it was just contradictory to what we had heard on the news and what seemed to be happening everywhere
5295200 i ended up going to the doctor in the springtime
5295201 they found out that i was really anemic the question i have now is did i ever really have it am i immune to it am i going to get it again
5295202 people who have been told they have it are out on the lake not really worrying about it
5295203 i cant imagine how many people have been told that
5295204 maybe theres something seriously wrong that they dont know about and they say nah its west nile
5295205 we try to do education for physicians and stuff like that thats the best we can do is try to educate people of what tests to draw and those kinds of things
5295206 thats the only way to tell for sure if theres west nile

5295210 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5295211 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5295212 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

5295216 belligerent measures taken by a nation to prevent passage of vessels or aircraft to and from another country customary international law recognizes blockades as an act of war because of the belligerent use of force even against third party nations in enforcing the blockade blockades as acts of war have been recognized as such in the declaration of paris of 1856 and the declaration of london of 1909 that delineate the international rules of warfare
5295217 as part of general international law and customary international law
5295218 the seizure of a french vessel is an act of hostility or reprisal requiring congressional approval the court held that congress pursuant to constitutional war powers had authorized hostilities on the high seas under certain circumstances
5295219 even an order from the president could not justify or excuse an act that violated the laws and customs of warfare chief justice john marshall wrote that a captain of a united states warship could be held personally liable in trespass for wrongfully seizing a neutral danish ship even though
5295220 the courts position seems consistent with a typical trespass case where defendants are liable even when they have a reasonable good faith but mistaken belief in authority to enter on the plaintiffs land
5295221 a blockade of coastal states that had joined the confederacy at the outset of the civil war the court explicitly ruled that a blockade is an act of war and is legal only if properly authorized under the constitution
5295222 the power of declaring war is the highest sovereign power and is limited to the representative of the full sovereignty of the nation it is limited in the united states to its congress exclusively and the authority of the president to be the commander in chief to take that the law be faithfully executed is to be taken in connection with the exclusive power given to congress to declare war and does not enable the president to do it or to introduce without act of congress war or any of its legal disabilities or liabilities on any citizen of the united states
5295223 vested in a congress of the united states which shall consist of a senate and house of representatives
5295224 to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and welfare of the united states
5295225 make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces
5295226 to declare war grant letters of marque and reprisal and make rules concerning capture on land and water
5295227 fundamental doctrine of the constitution to declare war is fully and exclusively vested in the legislature
5295228 determine the existence of any threat to the peace or act of aggression and if necessary take military or other actions to restore international peace and stability
5295229 right of individual or collective self defense if an armed attack occurs against a member until the security council has taken measures to maintain international peace and security
5295230 we will be forced to react not with diplomatic but with military technical methods
5295231 for the sake of the people and the environment we appeal to the warring parties to opt for diplomacy and negotiation and to shun violence as a means of addressing disputes we further ask the authorities to provide urgent and adequate support to all people displaced by the rising conflict
5295232 bullets grenades improvised explosive devices and other war tools destroy wildlife disturb native habitats and poison the air water and soil with toxic chemicals
5295233 we deplore all forms of violence that only divide and impoverish our nation harm our communities and the environment and divert essential human and financial resources from constructive and beneficial purposes
5295234 funds for war can be used instead for building classrooms producing instructional materials and increasing teachers salaries promoting primary health care advancing zero waste resource management and creating sustainable jobs and livelihood
5295235 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5295236 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5295237 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5295238 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

5295245 is closer than ever to forming the critical mass necessary
5295246 imbalance in wisconsin and midwest between the recognized high levels of research and development occurring in the region and the disproportionately low levels of venture capital dollars seeking investments
5295247 creates a highly inefficient market that offers an advantage to investors with deep connections to the research channels and the experience and skill to build companies to commercialize that research the lack of competition for deals gives early investors the opportunity to invest at attractive valuations and to select the best opportunities
5295248 the fund does not have a mandated geographic limit in their partnership agreements but the local nature of venture capital investments and the particular strategy of this fund make it clear they will focus on opportunities in wisconsin and the midwest if they fit the funds general strategy
5295249 the local venture capital environment continues to evolve with the quality of startups in wisconsin and the midwest being some of the best in united states
5295250 the support structure for early start up companies is far better today compared to when we first started investing regionally in 1999 we feel the future is bright given what has taken place over the past nine years and expect to be able to capitalize on that

5295266 this is what the olympics is about having extraordinary performances
5295267 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5295268 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5295269 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5295270 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5295271 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5295272 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5295273 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

5295279 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5295280 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5295281 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5295282 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5295283 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5295284 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5295285 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5295286 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5295287 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5295288 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5295289 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5295290 the big issue for us is capacity what were doing far exceeds normal usage

5295466 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5295467 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5295468 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5295469 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5295470 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5295471 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5295472 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5295473 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

5295477 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5295478 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5295479 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5295480 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5295481 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5295482 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5295483 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5295484 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5295485 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5295486 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5295487 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5295488 several moments when sen mccains reply was sharp and to the point sen obama by contrast took longer pauses after many of his questions and his answers often came together slowly
5295489 was mccains night obama made no big mistakes but his tendency to somewhat windy generalities meant he wasnt particularly compelling mccain who went second was crisp by contrast and his anecdotes colorful
5295490 i think barack obama did well for himself but i think the clear winner in the forum was john mccain he is someone who does not wear religion on his sleeve he does not talk about his personal life and he felt very much at ease with this type of forum
5295491 impressed people with his ease talking the language of faith no small feat for a democrat but mccain may have shored up support from this critical group
5295492 it is now clear why barack obama has refused john mccains offer of joint town hall appearances during the fall campaign mccain is obviously better at them
5295493 performance at the warren forum helps change the political psychology going into the conventions
5295494 i would rather live in mccains world than obamas but i believe that we live in obamas world afterward the commentators talked abut how obama needs to have better stories to be more accessible and less aloof and to have sharper shorter simpler answers rather than be so cerebral but obama is authentic
5295495 offered their sharply divergent views on abortion this weekend at an orange county church it was a rare chance to hear the presidential rivals address one of the most contentious issues in american politics
5295496 a democrat who supports abortion rights but reminded the audience at saddleback church that he wanted to make the procedure less common has managed to make accommodations to abortion opponents without complaints from his partys base
5295497 who opposes abortion has ignited new tensions with the republican partys conservative wing by trying to mollify those who want it to remain legal
5295498 was not in a cone of silence on saturday night while his rival
5295499 said mr mccain was in his motorcade on the way to the church as mr obama was being interviewed by the rev rick warren
5295500 locked in a dead heat with republican sen john mccain who now leads among white voters overall and has gained among republicans evangelicals and white working class people

5295502 the gallup polls daily tracking survey also reported friday that the race is a tie 44 percent to 44 percent with mr obama slipping from his 47 percent average over the past week
5295503 less than two years after democrats finally bridged the decades long gap between the parties on national security issues republicans have opened it right back up a shift likely tied to the partys new standard bearer john mccain and the perception of improvements in iraq

5295505 told usa today on sunday that he has no problem with his top foreign policy adviser randy scheunemanns past lobbying work
5295506 role as lobbyist and campaign adviser came to light in may when usa today reported he had contacted mccains senate office on georgias behalf last year while he was working for the campaign
5295507 im proud to have supported them and im so proud that so many of my friends have done so who also believe in freedom and democracy
5295508 recognized that long term to protect the democracy and the human rights of the world that its essential that the former soviet states become part of nato and that is the best defense from russian aggression
5295509 if we would have preemptively worked with russia with georgia making sure that nato had the kind of ability and the presence and the engagement we could have perhaps avoided this we dont know but because the bush mccain approach has been to focus almost exclusively on iraq over the last five years a lot of these issues have gone without the kind of attention they deserve
5295510 we are not all georgians now if we were georgians and the russians were invading our country and killing our people wed be in a state of war and clearly thats not what we want and john sometimes hes a good person but hes a little bit given to this kind of bellicose rhetoric which has a tendency to inflame conflicts rather than to diffuse them and thats what you want in a president
5295511 beat john mccain in fund raising for july but the illinois democrat appears to have needed every penny because the expense of his large field operation ate up several million dollars more than he took in for the month

5295518 huddled privately with t boone pickens in a small conference room in the bowels of a casino hotel to discuss the legendary texas energy traders much publicized energy policy proposal
5295519 roughly a month into his crusade to make renewable energy the number one issue of the presidential race and it seems to be working

5295533 the bush administration has found itself battling a familiar charge that its response to a major crisis was slow and uncertain
5295534 hesitance to roundly and immediately condemn russias aug 8 invasion stood in contrast to the response of the two major presidential candidates some observers said mr bush was unassertive when he needed to be bold
5295535 it had to mark some sort of watershed last week when bushs press office sent out its latest e mail complaint this time directed at that leftist bastion the wall street journal s editorial page
5295536 sharp response underscored a growing public relations problem facing president bush during his last months in office a lot of conservatives are increasingly unhappy with him particularly when it comes to foreign affairs for a president already burdened with approval ratings well below 30 percent this is not welcome news
5295537 as with many foreign policy issues this one highlighted a continuing fight within the administration
5295538 secretary rice national security adviser stephen j hadley and under secretary of state william j burns
5295539 in the last week two major pillars of bushs approach to foreign policy spreading democracy and improving relations with russia have crumbled jeopardizing eight years of work and sending the administration scrambling for new strategies in the waning months of its term

5295543 said rice had requested the north atlantic treaty organization emergency session under instructions from
5295544 assured georgia would join nato as she strongly backed the ex soviet republics president mikheil saakashvili in his conflict with russia
5295545 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5295546 it was one of the strongest statements yet of support for georgias nato membership bid which is fiercely opposed by russia
5295547 is strongly in favour of georgia joining nato but misgivings from france and germany prevented tbilisi being awarded full candidate status in bucharest

5295554 a visit to this war strafed city sunday turned up no proof of russian claims that more than 2 000 people died here
5295555 as russian troops pounded through georgia last week the kremlin and its allies repeatedly pointed to one justification above all others the georgian military had destroyed the city of tskhinvali but a trip to the city on sunday without official escorts revealed a very different picture while it was clear there had been heavy fighting missiles knocked holes in walls and bombs tore away rooftops almost all of the buildings seen in an afternoon driving around tskhinvali were still standing
5295556 musharraf says he is resigning to avoid an impeachment battle that would harm the nations interests
5295557 whatever he has done was for the people and for the country

5295559 who are trying to force congress to lift restrictions on offshore drilling say they have 38 senators backing their efforts to force a showdown over the critical campaign issue of energy prices one that could shut down the government
5295560 want to extend the moratorium on new offshore oil and gas drilling which is due to expire oct 1 and the most likely route would be to attach the proposal to a catchall spending bill needed to keep the federal government running but at least 38 republicans have signed a letter pledging to actively oppose that extension
5295561 block the legislation by rallying 41 senators to join a filibuster but some hesitate to threaten a government shutdown during an election year
5295562 generation of democratic politicians the notion of opening protected sites to drilling was toxic but with soaring gas prices public opinion is shifting toward anything that promises relief at the pump and congressional politics is moving with it
5295563 shift on saturday speaker nancy pelosi said that the house will take up comprehensive energy legislation next month that includes partially lifting the 1981 ban on offshore drilling
5295564 it will consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
5295565 said that the senate will also examine lifting the ban which now covers all but central and western portions of the gulf of mexico and some parts of alaska
5295566 got a skeptical reaction from republicans who said they suspect it will contain other provisions unacceptable to the minority the result may be that congress remains deadlocked on the potent election issue
5295567 the clearest sign yet that democratic congressional leaders are tacking away from earlier strong opposition to expanded offshore oil production in the face of opinion polls that indicate many voters favor the drill more stand adopted by republican presidential candidate sen john mccain and others in his party

5295580 kami memulai dengan melihat semut semut yang menaruh telur telur semut dari koloni mereka di dalam sarang koloni semut lain kami inigin mengetahui kenapa semut membiarkan ini terjadi
5295581 namun ada sejumlah besar kimia pada telur telur itu dan menemukan yang mana yang penting dan krusial untuk sistem pengenalan adalah sebuah masalah tersendiri dan telah menjadi permasalahan dalam kurun waktu sekitar satu abad
5295582 mereka menghasilkan sebuah senyawa campuran alkana dan alkena sehingga jika kita ingin mengetahui jawaban masalah ini maka semut ini adalah satu pemberi jawaban terbaik
5295583 ketika kami mencelupkan semut kedalam heksana dan diberikan profil alkena baru dan semut ini dikembalikan ke koloninya maka dengan segera dia diserang
5295584 para serangga sangatlah sensitif terhadap perubahan dalam profil profil ini
5295585 bukanlah sebuah pertanyaan dari sebuah koloni membuat sebuah senyawa kimia dan koloni lain membuat yang berbeda ini hanyalah aturan atas dan bawah dari alkena dengan perbedaan dari panjang rantai karbon itulah yang telah membuat penelitian selama ini tidak melangkah ke hal yang baru
5295586 kami berhasil membuat bijih teman dan lawan dari sebuah koloni
5295587 ketika bijih dengan bau koloni mereka maka bijih diacuhkan namun semut bersifat agresif terhadap bijih dengan bau yang asing dengan cara berusaha memindahkannya
5295588 kita sekarang membutuhkan jawaban tentnag bagaimana mereka membuat senyawa ini dan menyelidiki bagaimana mungkin beberapa koloni lebih agresif dibandingkan koloni lain
5295589 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5295590 i am leaving with the satisfaction that whatever i could do for this country i did it with integrity

5295598 los aeropuertos funcionen igual de bien que los puertos ya que la infraestructura portuaria es un ejemplo de la infraestructura que necesita la comunitat valenciana para seguir creciendo
5295599 lo que queremos es que nuestros aeropuertos reciban las inversiones que llegan a los puertos
5295600 si al final el ejecutivo central lleva adelante la transferencia de algunos aeropuertos a las comunidades aut nomas nuestra propuesta es que el modelo aeroportuario espa ol siga el portuario un modelo de xito y de crecimiento constante en los ltimos a os
5295601 durante los diez ltimos a os los puertos de la comunitat valenciana han crecido el doble que los del resto de espa a
5295602 un modelo de xito y de eficiencia esenciales para el crecimiento econ mico de la comunitat
5295603 desde que hace diez a os se aprobara la nueva ley de puertos donde se dio y transfiri una gesti n determinada a estas infraestructuras los puertos se han convertido en un modelo de gesti n eficaz de inversi n y de valor a adido que pretendemos que se extienda al resto de grandes sectores
5295604 se ha multiplicado por dos y hasta por tres el dinamismo econ mico y la capacidad de creaci n de riqueza de los puertos en los ltimos a os
5295605 as se ha llevado a cabo una gesti n eficaz que ha logrado un constante crecimiento tanto de inversiones y de mercanc as en estos lugares de la comunitat

5295632 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5295633 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5295634 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5295635 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5295636 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5295637 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5295638 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5295639 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5295640 npower has managed to buck the trend in a spectacular way the company needs to take urgent remedial action across a whole range of areas and energywatch will be working closely with npower to assist their recovery

5295656 ese orden hay que hacerlo en torno a acuerdos bien concretos

5295663 the combination of these two established companies will be very complementary given the respective brand portfolios and the demographics in which they predominantly operate
5295664 additionally there will be a number of important benefits for competitive games in terms of capital availability profitability and an expanded user base this consolidation makes both good strategic and financial sense and is well timed particularly as the gaming laws in the us are under review and the industrys competitive dynamics continue to intensify
5295665 sports network fantasy ltd tender offer is exciting for both companies because of the synergistic opportunities it provides sports network fantasy ltd is an established and recognizable name in the industry the acquisition will immediately expose competitive games to a new demographic and increase traffic flow and corresponding business opportunities the casual games division coupled with competitive games new social networking capabilities would be a great addition to sports network fantasy ltd current sports interests

5295681 la relaci n que exist a en tucapel entre la fiscal a y el servicio de inteligencia militar que era el equipo operativo los torturadores era muy fluido era una relaci n muy coordinada as es que nadie menos quien ejerc a las funciones en los hechos de fiscal puede alegar ignorancia en lo que ocurr a

5295700 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5295701 i pray the government stops this downward slide and takes the country out of this crisis
5295702 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual

5295717 democracy is a poor system of government at best the only thing that can honestly be said in its favor is that it is about eight times as good as any other method the human race has ever tried democracys worst faults is that its leaders are likely to reflect the faults and virtues of their constituents a depressingly low level but what else can you expect

5295723 i find it unbelievable with the price of gas and the economy in the shape it is in that you are not making exceptions to your two night minimum stay
5295724 in a day and age where traveling is getting harder and harder to do because of gas prices irrelevantly high priced hotel rooms just isnt part of the plan anymore
5295725 feedback from millions of visitors collected over the past year demonstrates a clear negative correlation between gas prices and customer satisfaction on automotive and travel web sites
5295726 as the price at the pump has spiked consumers are venting their frustrations online and it isnt just that satisfaction is hurting measurable business outcomes are falling as well in an environment like this its critical that marketers tune into changing consumer sentiment in order to pinpoint opportunities to make small changes that can positively impact customer satisfaction conversion and sales

5295733 today companies are increasing their already high focus on optimizing working capital exploring both financial and supply chain strategies and technologies to aid in these initiatives a strategic forward looking global corporation should think about its physical and financial supply chains holistically integrating long term end to end supply chain cost considerations with working capital concerns
5295734 there is still a lot of value trapped in todays manually managed financial supply chains process and financial efficiencies can be achieved by improving visibility into physical and financial supply chain milestones and documents automation of order to cash and procure to pay processes and rethinking of the old financing and payment practices with a companys trading partners
5295735 in todays complex supply networks and n tier supply chains there is a significant opportunity to improve cash flow at each level
5295736 instead of one party being a winner and the other a loser in a transaction working capital improvements can be made in a win win environment significant opportunity arises when a third party becomes involved to provide financial services with the right set of tools and services in place companies can collaborate with supply chain partners to determine what is best for the overall supply chain and use the correct levers to improve margin and cash flow simultaneously

5295743 we chose intellidots system because of its track record of high nurse adoption ease of use and documentation compliance
5295744 the ability to easily communicate with our existing meditech system and the fact that nurse workarounds are far less likely with intellidot really set the system apart i havent seen anything else on the market that has the ease of use and mobility of the intellidot system
5295745 one of the strengths of the intellidot system is that nurses can use it with just one hand
5295746 thats important for nurses because theyre multi tasking all day its wonderful to have a lightweight device that they can carry with them all the time
5295747 patient safety is our priority and the safety features of the intellidot system are more than we could ask for
5295748 our nurses feel safer and more confident that they are doing the right things for their patients
5295749 because it has been designed by nurses for nurses the intellidot barcode point of care system has achieved the highest adoption rates in the industry averaging over 95 percent for typical customers
5295750 combined with its small light form factor ability to be easily cleaned and disinfected 12 hour battery life and ability to communicate with any his the intellidot caret system truly represents the next generation of barcode point of care at the bedside

5295799 on the one hand declining birth rates and a strong tendency towards the two child norm has led to a standardisation in birth patterns on the other hand the increasing instability of partnerships has resulted in the individual s experience of the family often becoming much more turbulent and diverse than before people often enter into several different relationships during the course of their lives and also experience a very varied range of family constellations ranging from the classic father mother child family to the patchwork family
5295800 the high quality and sheer scale of the ehf survey will allow us to identify the full spectrum of paths families follow including those which are rather more unusual we can study the data provided by 380 000 men and women who were asked about their origins children partnerships and social background one key factor is that in contrast to other surveys there is a relatively large body of data available on men in addition to identifying general family models this means we will also be able to reveal potential differences in the family biographies of men and women
5295801 i felt compelled to make a statement about this after seeing how the right kind of private tuition and understanding of a particular student in beijing made such a huge difference to him his family and his future
5295802 the young man was expelled from western academy beijing after he made a mistake in trying to impress a gang of bullies in order to avoid being bullied himself this boy is incredibly bright but the school simply did not find the right way to engage him or deal with this group of troublesome students the family found themselves in a terrible situation their child had been expelled from a prestigious private school he had effectively lost a semester of work thus damaging his grade point average and it seemed impossible for him to be able to attend any decent university let alone the ivy league school he wanted
5295803 and with the help of a full time live in tutor this disillusioned teenager raised his grade point average from 3 3 to 3 7 in only four months after he was enrolled in a structured distance learning program hell have 13 more a grades by the end of the year and with the extra classes he has opted for hell be on track to get his grade point average to 4 and above meaning he has every chance of getting into his chosen college
5295804 we have arranged for him to have daily private tuition with a cambridge university professor during his summer holidays in the uk which he is enjoying immensely this demonstrates to me that with the most challenging students the right kind of intervention can make all the difference many families assume that if they are paying for their child to attend the most prestigious private schools the child will automatically get the best education
5295805 i urge parents of children in this situation who are failing at school to consider the possibility of making an alternative choice like this family in beijing

5295812 the time for justice within henrico county and every other district is now our children can no longer wait for those that are charged with the welfare to decide to put politics down and put children first we can no longer wait for the fred mortons john montgomeries lamont bagbies marilyn royals andy armstrongs and those like them to lay down their corrupt and selfish hearts for the hearts of our children it will not happen cannot happen and they have no desire for it to happen we as parents are the experts and god ordained advocates for our children we must rid the county of these heartless and callous people that fight viciously for the enemies of our children and their futures we must fight just as viciously as they do to rid our district and schools of the karen woods that have made it clear that they are not here to advocate for our children henrico county public schools needs a colonic a flushing out of its bowels a powerful water force of justice that will detach and uproot the impacted feces of corrupt individuals that has implanted itself in an educational system for our children that should be as free flowing as a river but is not because of the damn that those that oppose our children have built the board has shown that they will not stand for justice the superintendent has shown that he will not stand for justice some central office staff has shown that they will not stand for justice some building administrators have shown that they will not stand for justice so my question as i close is who will stand for justice and who will stand for children henrico has made it clear that they wont so there is no need in expecting them to do it justice is not in their hearts so they cannot produce it in their actions we must fight for justice for our children if we fight and it does not take many of us look at the hell that i a single woman of color am giving and will continue to give them think about what ten twenty thirty forty fifty one hundred of us will do to them now i aint scared and i told them i aint goin no where i will be the thorn in their side and you can be a thorn in their side until the either do right or move to the left out of the way

5295877 i find it strange that people in the uk are arguing today whether it is humane to detain someone without charge beyond 28 days e g up to 42 days when i have already been detained without charge for nearly four years such debates are smokescreens to hide the real injustices that are happening in britain today
5295878 it is no exaggeration to say that at the time of the arrest there was not one shred of admissible evidence against barot the arrest was perfectly lawful there were more than sufficient grounds but in terms of evidence to put before a court there was nothing there then began the race against time to retrieve evidence from the mass of computers and other it equipment that we seized it was only at the very end of the permitted period of detention that sufficient evidence was found to justify charges i know that some in the media were sharpening their pencils and that if we had been unable to bring charges in that case there would have been a wave of criticism about the arrests barot himself of course eventually pleaded guilty last year and received a 40 year sentence

5295929 nobody knew how this mechanism worked before we described this protein
5295930 this protein directly affects photosynthesis and how plants create biomass stems leaves and stalks and oils
5295931 weve found that if the tgd4 protein is malfunctioning the plant then accumulates oil in its leaves
5295932 if the plant is storing oil in its leaves there could be more oil per plant which could make production of biofuels such as biodiesel more efficient more research is needed so we can completely understand the mechanism of operation
5295933 even if you have lots of sequence for complex communities it still doesnt tell you which organism is responsible for which function
5295934 this publication presents an approach via simplification and targeted metagenomic sequencing of how you can go after the function in the environment
5295935 to utilize these single carbon compounds organisms employ very specialized metabolism
5295936 we suspect that in the environment there are novel versions of this metabolism and possibly completely novel pathways
5295937 it is very important for metagenomic assemblies to rely on high quality reads

5295953 its a good deal for the businesses its a good deal for the railroad and the community
5295954 oh no dont you stop for anyone let it out
5295955 not see any necessity to clarify a point of law
5295956 it brings some access to people that normally wouldnt have it it gives them another marketing opportunity
5295957 from the point of view of a berry grower this is a great idea
5295958 if you dont have some kind of way to use the surplus youre just going to feed it to the pigs
5295959 it the freezing unit really helps the finances of the growers it prevents the waste
5295960 the piece of equipment was designed to meet the states unique desire to see this sort of on farm processing happening
5295961 i think once this thing starts being used people are going to be looking for it
5295962 we have plans to expand the vermont mystic pie with other kinds of berries
5295963 the constraint was being able to go from harvest to processor with berries from the field
5295964 its great for processors that want to use fresh fruit in a variety of products where its important that the fruit identity hold firm
5295965 it was interpreted as support for the growing campaign to ban free plastic bags
5295966 we cant do anything to change the world until capitalism crumbles

5295969 they were not directly involved in the london bombings in the sense that they were responsible for making or transporting the bombs
5295970 the bombers scattered identity and bank cards around the tube carriages they targeted before placing their rucksacks on the floor and setting off the explosives
5295971 although they were damaged to some extent they personal materials and documents such as id cards relating to the bombers did not show the damage that would be expected if they were on the body of the bomber or in the rucksack suggesting that in each case they had been deliberately separated by some distance from the actual explosion
5295972 the bombers were not wearing the rucksacks at the time of the explosions but had instead put them down on the floor of the bus and tube trains
5295973 waheed ali 24 had photographs of the destroyed world trade center and the damaged pentagon on his hard drive
5295974 obviously islamic terrorists carried out the attacks a government which took us into an illegal war in iraq that turned us all into targets has allowed islamic extremists to preach in mosques in britain and use them to recruit people to their cause
5295975 he and others like him are active in disseminating not only
5295976 he nick kollerstrom has commented on blairwatch using astro3 and giving his website as any guesses people yes bridget dunnes site whats to debate
5295977 one fact that keeps cropping up is the links between these self professed truthers and holocaust deniers and nazi apologists

5295982 the first time we spun we were up to sixth gear and flying
5295983 i just closed my eyes and waited for the bangs but there were none
5295984 we were able to get ourselves up the bank and back into the action but then we span and finished up facing the wrong way and on the racing line
5295985 we knew the next competitor was closing in on us at high speed so it was a massive relief when we righted ourselves and got going just in the nick of time and thankfully we move on to the woodpecker all in one piece
5295986 we do need to have this discussion as a community but the government needs to be quite clear about this move not coming in as cost neutral
5295987 we need to look at alternative education pathways at training and vocational education at allowing them to participate in non school settings
5295988 we dont doubt that allowing students to remain in education for longer will improve their life changes but for students who are disengaged struggling and at low levels of achievement two years in college is not the best idea more important lets look at early intervention so a student doesnt want to leave school at 15 in the first place
5295989 more harm than good to have students sitting in classrooms when they dont want to be there
5295990 there is a years difference in ages in each year level so any reform should look at completion to a specific level not age
5295991 well advanced on a formal agreement under the umbrella of a pre existing memorandum between the bureau of meteorology and the united states national oceanic and atmospheric administration
5295992 continuing to satisfy united states operational requirements for data from these systems
5295993 the united states will ensure its ability to selectively deny critical environmental data to an adversary during crisis or war yet ensure the use of such data by us and allied military forces
5295994 essentially what this is about is delivering gps after hours where theyre needed the most because we know theres a gap in the market
5295995 this isnt competing with existing gps because the vast majority of gps only operate until 6 maybe 8pm
5295996 so what this is about is filling that gap and taking pressure off the emergency departments we know and ive been there myself on a number of occasions with small kids that a lot of people in emergency departments are there for things that could ordinarily be handled by a gp but because its 11 oclock at night they simply have no other option other than to go to the emergency department
5295997 after four years of no health policy theyve come up with a policy that they just cant deliver on
5295998 my policy provides 60 grants of 75 000 each to attract gps from interstate to relocate to canberra
5295999 we will also ensure that anu medical graduates who want to are able to stay in canberra
5296000 we will help canberra doctors to establish their first private practice by providing low interest loans of up to 150 000 each
5296001 i think theyre desperate to get elected theyve targeted those clinics electorally and it leaves the whole issue of the rebuild of the health system which is something that weve got a plan for unanswered
5296002 weve already said that theres a lot of what the government has planned in terms of the last budget that we agree with
5296003 process that makes a website accessible functional and culturally suited to a specific market

5296008 finding statistically robust associations linked to two proteins that may be involved in regulating such ion channels and that are also thought to be targets of drugs used to clinically to treat bipolar disorder is astonishing
5296009 faced with little agreement among previous studies searching for the genomic hot spots in bipolar disorder these researchers pooled their data for maximal statistical power and unearthed surprising results
5296010 improved understanding of these abnormalities could lead to new hope for the millions of americans affected by bipolar disorder
5296011 individuals taking antidepressants should be aware of the possible cognitive effects as they may affect performance in social academic and work settings as well as driving abilities

5296027 dealing with islamist extremism the messages are more complex the constituencies we would aim at are more difficult to identify and greater damage could be done to the overall effort if links back to uk or us sources were revealed
5296028 the case was written produced and directed by the fbi
5296029 long before freedom of expression was enshrined by statute it has been a well established principle of a free and democratic society
5296030 there must be room in such a democratic society not only for views which are favourably received but also views which shock offend or disturb the state
5296031 i am left in no doubt that your speeches were used by you as self aggrandisement and not as an expression of sincerely held religious views i find that you are arrogant contemptuous and utterly devoid of any sign of remorse
5296032 uttering the word nonsense in an instance where there is reasonable suspicion to presume the intent of casting aspersions on the nature of what is being said for the purposes of terrorism inciting terrorism glorifying terrorism or knowing of the existence of the words terrorist and terrorism
5296033 he played islamic music full of wailing and chanting similar to what you hear in a curry house
5296034 we were absolutely shocked it was the last thing you would expect to happen in a quiet place like this
5296035 he was struggling in life but i had no idea he had become a muslim before i saw him two weeks ago
5296036 i could not believe my eyes he was dressed in full robes and had a beard he must have undergone a massive change in identity
5296037 i suddenly had a burst of energy and knew i had a lot more life left in me and thats when i woke up to the sound of the first song i ever bought
5296038 i would love to thank mick jagger and the rest of the stones personally i feel they really did help wake me from my coma

5296041 he was so up for it we took the decision that paintballing would be a fun way of introducing him
5296042 there are many many british muslims that i know who for the past 15 or 20 years have been going paintballing its a harmless enough activity i dont think there is any suggestion or ever has been that its a terrorist training activity
5296043 i got the sense that he was already talking to the police i referred it to my immediate boss at the bbc i wasnt told that there was an obligation in fact it was referred above her as well it was such a big story
5296044 i dont think its my obligation to tell another adult that he should go to the police
5296045 dealing with islamist extremism the messages are more complex the constituencies we would aim at are more difficult to identify and greater damage could be done to the overall effort if links back to uk or us sources were revealed
5296046 no one understood better than stalin that the true object of propaganda is neither to convince nor even to persuade but to produce a uniform pattern of public utterance in which the first trace of unorthodox thought immediately reveals itself as a jarring dissonance
5296047 there are many many british muslims that i know who for the past 15 or 20 years have been going paintballing its a harmless enough activity i dont think there is any suggestion or ever has been that its a terrorist training activity
5296048 she seems to have focused solely on muslim bad boys and her output makes jd salinger look like a workaholic
5296049 we took the decision that paintballing would be a fun way of introducing him
5296050 one wonders whether viewers readers and listeners will ever want to trust media bosses again
5296051 apart from the assumption implicit in that statement that viewers readers and listeners entirely trusted the media in the first place i concur with his sentiments and add this latest fine example of nationwide media duplicity to the long list of others
5296052 if i would say anything about all the journalists i have met around this subject they just appear a bit institutionalised
5296053 it would be fair to say that adam livingstone isnt the only person with a job who has a mortgage to pay or rent to pay or income tax to pay or council tax to pay or who has to pay for food water gas or electricity
5296054 the point about mohammed hamid is he was an open book there was nothing secretive about him so that makes me wonder about the nature of this case
5296055 i think what youve got now though is that british laws on terrorism can basically prosecute somebody for what they say because of the impact they might have on others even if theyre not aware of this and i think that is concerning
5296056 i think the reality of this and i think that what is of most concern today is that british muslims will feel that if they speak their mind because after all what message was so dangerous the message that he was criticising british foreign policy in muslim lands that if you actually have that message and if you speak openly about that message youre in danger of ending up in jail
5296057 we have the rule of law we have an independent police force and they do an extremely good job they should be supported
5296058 first woman in britain to be shot dead deliberately by a police marksman
5296059 i can confidently say the vast majority if not all of those 21 crimes relate to air weapons dangerous gun crime is not rife across the district
5296060 it is very rare for a real firearm such as this to be in our patch
5296061 the main reason i have come across is that people are either older and want to protect their own assets or they have been through a separation before and they want to make sure they are protected
5296062 she assumed he was a customer he sat on a blue sofa and began asking how much it was she said as they discussed cost he was swaying laughing and smiling and she thought he was on drugs
5296063 one cannot think of anything potentially more serious than to set fire to a furniture shop
5296064 im relieved that justice has been done and would like to thank the fire brigade and police who did an amazing job
5296065 it was a very frightening experience for everyone involved there was lots of smoke damage to the shop and everything outside was destroyed suffolk homes
5296066 the more you smoke the more likely you are to have a stroke certainly quitting is the best thing you could do but cutting back does offer some benefit
5296067 they dont see as much difference between themselves and others
5296068 prayer belongs in your heart in your mind and in your church
5296069 politics does not belong in your church i dont come to your church and preach my politics
5296070 i would hope that southport refrains from pursuing a course that in my estimation is unconstitutional
5296071 my gut is that if the prayer were challenged it would probably be upheld
5296072 heavenly father would probably be regarded as kind of a safe ceremonial deism its probably the case that this prayer is constitutionally permissible but that doesnt mean its required

5296082 the good news is obviously no state is better prepared or organized to deal with whatever comes this way than the state of florida
5296083 youll be in our thoughts and prayers i am very impressed by what youre doing and what youre prepared to do coming from a state that is not often hit by a hurricane im incredibly impressed
5296084 we have assumed that for the first 72 hours we should rely on no one but ourselves because thats how long it takes for help to come
5296085 weve had a fortunate two years but for all of us who were here the memories of 2004 and 2005 are still fresh
5296086 now is the time for floridians to take the steps necessary to prepare should fays track bring her over our state this week
5296087 we hope that this storm does not turn into a hurricane and if it does that the damage is minimal

5296167 the charges in the indictment that the defendants planned and waged aggressive wars are charges of the utmost gravity war is essentially an evil thing its consequences are not confined to the belligerent states alone but affect the whole world to initiate a war of aggression therefore is not only an international crime it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole

5296217 we were awakened by the sound of the gun and wanted to go out but the men began throwing stones over our roofs and other houses in the neighborhood they continued firing in the air again something that frightened us
5296218 so last night while he was studying in his living room as usual the armed men entered the community
5296219 they demanded that he open the door but he refused on ground that he did not know them and asked them for their identities before opening the door at that point the men fired several rounds at the front door to force it open but the door was sealed and could not easily open

5296251 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5296252 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5296253 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5296254 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5296255 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5296288 for it emerged yesterday that the big bubbly lady with the brave smile and the most heart rending of tales may have invented the entire story consciously or unconsciously disaster victims will sometimes confuse a few details but the enormous question mark hanging over head is whether she was ever in the twin towers at all when the planes struck multiple inconsistencies in her story emerged after the new york times said it tried to interview her in recent weeks about her experiences to coincide with the sixth anniversary of the attack
5296289 with regard to the veracity of my clients story neither my client nor i have any comment
5296290 what became clear yesterday was that no one has ever bothered to verify the key details of heads remarkable wtc story or asked her to elaborate on others
5296291 the multiple simultaneous explosions that took place today on the london transportation system
5296292 a company of over a thousand people in london based on simultaneous bombs going off precisely at the railway stations where it happened this morning
5296293 it was based on bombs going off to the time the locations all this sort of stuff
5296294 a liar can become the president of a prominent survivors group despite their story never having been verified by anyone
5296295 i retired after not before the cps not the dpp made a decision that no prosecution was required
5296296 i can confirm that from this record it would appear that the file was received by the cps on or about 19th 21st july 1993 there is also an indication that a decision on how to proceed with this case was made on approximately 28th october 1993

5296300 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5296301 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5296302 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent senator obama
5296303 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5296304 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home

5296320 in petty incidents often where the abuse is mutual or it is unclear who the aggressor was
5296321 i spent three days as a juror in a case in which it seemed obvious early on that no conviction could possibly result
5296322 a woman had called 911 complaining her fianc had been drinking and pushed her onto their bed the defendant claimed he held her arms to keep her from hitting him with a phone the next day the woman phoned police and the district attorneys office asking that her fianc not be prosecuted
5296323 she stated that she had overreacted and that she would do anything she could to stop the prosecution nonetheless the case proceeded
5296324 the only other witness the prosecution had was a policeman who had heard the womans original complaint part of his testimony was contradicted by facts that could be ascertained from the 911 recording in the jury room some of us speculated about why this case had ever been brought to court
5296325 yes of course st fama and st french say so
5296326 we believe that 95 percent is the minimally acceptable probability of success for a given initial withdrawal rate
5296327 its an absolute fact that as people get older they spend less money
5296328 classic constant 1 25 of initial real value of portfolio
5296329 these two players are very good it shows our ambition the gaffer and chairman have been trying to get players in for a few weeks and been saying they want three or so players before the end of the transfer window
5296330 if we can get that calibre of player into the club then it can only help the club go forward and settle itself in the premier league
5296331 with the extra two subs this year you need a big squad and people fighting for places so the more players the better it can only benefit us
5296332 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5296333 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5296334 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5296335 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5296336 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5296337 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5296338 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5296339 we don need no education we don need no thought control

5296345 were looking into it it could happen probably womens clothes first and then go into children
5296346 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5296347 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open
5296348 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5296349 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5296350 we historically dont make our decisions within a 24 hour period it takes time to get everybody in a group and talk about it
5296351 let me just say that first and foremost that that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys there at jgr
5296352 i want to apologize to nascar to our partners to toyota guys a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5296353 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5296354 for us we kind of feel like in the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and chief engine builder mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5296355 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome
5296356 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5296357 well figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible
5296358 theres going to be punishment for that thats just part of life you cant do that
5296359 if this alleged incident proves true it goes against everything we stand for as an organization
5296360 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
5296361 i found out about it halfway through the day session last night when i went over there to see what was going on
5296362 i was surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing
5296363 but im sure joe and j d will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think were just going to keep working on our stuff
5296364 its not something that you like to hear about and you have to just question every chassis dyno thats ever been run on every toyota
5296365 you look at the no 32 car of brian vickers and red bull racing the 32 and the 18 and the 20 made about the same power the first run on the dyno when they took the magnet or whatever this device was out of the 18 and the 20 they both came up
5296366 what i dont know is if its a toyota problem if its a joe gibbs thing how widespread is it and how long has it been going on because a lot of whats been done by nascar has been based on the chassis dyno results
5296367 its disappointing to hear that anybody whether its a manufacturer or a team or an individual on a team would go to any length to do that
5296368 i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right
5296369 i feel as hard i have worked i have a chance to get the world record
5296370 training has been going really well probably the best of the season
5296371 it makes me train harder when i go to the track i know lashawn will be there working as hard as i am
5296372 the first is myself because as long as im running my race and i dont let myself do something different i feel like ill be hard to beat
5296373 the second is everyone else in the field because i can be beaten on any given day i just have to stay on top of things
5296374 when you have this many attacks you usually have at least some sort of accepting attitude by the villagers allowing that sort of behavior

5296394 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5296395 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5296396 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5296397 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5296398 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5296399 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5296400 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5296401 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5296402 who are open to doing something on the production side
5296403 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5296404 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5296405 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5296406 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5296407 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5296408 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5296409 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5296410 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5296411 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5296412 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5296413 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5296414 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5296415 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5296416 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5296417 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5296418 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5296419 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5296420 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5296421 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5296422 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5296423 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5296424 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5296425 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5296426 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5296427 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5296428 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5296429 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5296430 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5296431 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5296432 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5296433 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5296434 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5296435 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5296436 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5296437 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

5296470 he seemed very satisfied with the suits and said thank you to me in chinese
5296471 i think we started very well up top and in the defense
5296472 and then we made some individual mistakes and they got the goals
5296473 loads of them cristiane netted two and marta and formiga added one apiece to exact revenge for a loss at last years world cup final
5296474 its very hard to stop marta and cristiane with two or three players
5296475 i dont think it was a breakdown of our defense
5296476 we were running into fast breaks and they brazil did pretty well we could have conceded even more goals five or six but we could have scored on the other side as well
5296477 but germany didnt and surrendering four goals let alone the possibility of five or six is unheard of for the two time defending world cup champions still it was the lost opportunity to play for a gold medal that hurt the most for the germans
5296478 its not that we are going to play every tournament with no goals against us
5296479 if they score one more than us thats the important thing and we lose the game

5296486 we are almost certainly not going to be able to defend absolutely every bit of coast it would simply be an impossible task both in financial terms and engineering terms
5296487 we know the sea is eating away at the coast in quite a number of places primarily but not totally exclusively on the east and south coasts its a particularly huge issue in east anglia but in quite a number of other areas as well

5296490 we are not taking away these schools specialist status or the associated funding
5296491 we have postponed their redesignation until after their 2008 gcse results are known but they remain part of the specialist schools programme
5296492 weve never called these schools failing many of these schools are improving are on the right track and are doing a good job for their local communities
5296493 parents and prospective teachers are already aware of the issues these schools face the bottom line is that they can now be confident national challenge schools will get the extra money and extra support they need to improve further
5296494 it would be absurd for the government to financially penalise schools with lower results
5296495 im going to be as radical a social reformer as mrs thatcher was an economic reformer radical social reform is what this country needs right now

5296500 luckily i managed to put the brakes on but ive never been the victim of proper violent crime
5296501 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

5296503 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5296504 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5296505 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5296506 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5296507 huge sigh of relief on the part of the voters
5296508 when we had pick a party my office and county auditors received a huge amount of complaints and gripes
5296509 we are hearing nothing which is an indication that people are satisfied its been a remarkable change
5296510 reduces the value of information of who is a democrat and who is a republican
5296511 it will be the beginning of the end of her campaign
5296512 the tradition is to despise games as a brain drain type of thing
5296513 our teachers were taught and still are taught to lecture to cover the material
5296514 instead of mutual respect teachers dis the kids saying games contribute to a short attention span that theyre a waste of time thats not true
5296515 their attitude toward teachers is why should i learn from you its an atmosphere of mutual disrespect
5296516 this is a very clear example of kids knowing more than teachers
5296517 failure to connect how computers affect our childrens minds and what we can do about it
5296518 the main question is whether the activity whatever it is is educationally valid and contributes significantly to whatever is being studied
5296519 the point is not whether kids are playing with learning or what medium they are playing in a ball field or a wii setup or a physics lab or art studio but rather why they are doing it
5296520 just because it is electronic does not make it any better and it may turn out not to be as valuable
5296521 were not trying to get kids to consume more technology were trying to get them producing new technology and with technology producing new knowledge
5296522 education has been remarkably resistant to change for 100 years
5296523 its now more of this is a good idea how do we do it
5296524 it irritates me when people say that it has all gone wrong
5296525 im very satisfied how weve played this season the problem is expectations have gone too high
5296526 if people look at the fact we are in mid table and reached a cup semi final everyone would have taken that before the start of the season
5296527 what we did is that we played so well up to round 18 and that raised peoples expectations
5296528 a mob mentality its like a pack of wolves a swarm of bees going after their prey
5296529 thats the issue that we really need to contend with and we need to come up with a solution
5296530 darwinism appeared and under the guise of a foe did the work of a friend
5296531 the very study of the external world led to the conclusion that the content of consciousness is an ultimate reality
5296532 i used to tell people when i first came that we considered forensic science boys town but now its more like a girls world
5296533 i have to think that theres got to be some relationship between the roles that are represented on tv and the way women see whats possible for them as a career
5296534 a lot of them do realize that riding around in the hummers and wearing prada is not the day to day things
5296535 but i tell girls that i do a lot of things in pearls and pumps you can be a part of this used to be male dominated thing but you can still be feminine you can still be who you are
5296536 i think all of us have kind of an altruist bent for the greater good because we could probably be doing research chemistry or medical and making more money but everybody seems to have a passion for the science and work and wanting to help people
5296537 looking at women actually doing what i thought i wanted to do they seemed to have to make a really difficult choice as to making sure that their career was successful and also being successful moms and they did it and they did it well but it was just a choice that i did not want to make

5296558 that was an incredible result and a fantastic feeling i hope it will be the first of many podiums in formula one
5296559 the important thing was that we showed just how competitive we are at the moment and moved further ahead in fourth place in the constructors championship there is a great atmosphere in the team and we are all working hard together to move forward which is why it was so satisfying to get on the podium in hungary but valencia is a new race and we must start again
5296560 i did plenty of street races when i was racing in champ cars and in that season almost all the tracks were new to me so i have learnt to adapt quickly

5296600 according to the polling data you dont stand a snowballs chance in hell of winning in the election and you are getting almost no support at all but you say you are proud of your campaign how can you be so proud of your campaign when you are apparently doing so poorly
5296601 i was not in the middle of that mess those two were in my administration there will be zero tolerance for any corruption and i do support a full investigation of the cemis scandal
5296602 you say that as the mayor of panama you had limited powers and responsibilities and that many issues fall to the central government but one thing that clearly falls to you was the issue of garbage collection since you have not been able to fix that after eight years in office how do you expect to be able to run the country
5296603 especially events like this and seeing all these people that came out here to be here for my dad its amazing how theyre still here still behind us
5296604 the track looks amazing and the location is fantastic so i am really looking forward to this grand prix
5296605 i enjoy going to new venues because they are a new challenge and there is always something to discover every race is unique and i like that
5296606 i am expecting a competitive weekend as well because at the moment we are looking quite strong scoring more points is our target and if we challenge for the podium again that would be great
5296607 there is a great atmosphere in the team and we are all working hard together to move forward which is why it was so satisfying to get on the podium in hungary
5296608 it looks like an interesting circuit and its quite long so it should be a good show we will have plenty of work to do on friday to adjust the car to the track but we are in good form at the moment so i am optimistic for this weekend

5296640 some of my plans and schemes have had to be put on hold because there is not much i can do if i cant walk properly
5296641 the surgery went as planned and annie is now recuperating at home annie would like to send her thanks and appreciation to all that have sent their well wishes in the past few days
5296642 nobodys come up with a way to prevent this from happening even here in the u s
5296643 the u s is probably more internet dependent than any place in the world so to that extent were more vulnerable than any place in the world to this kind of attack
5296644 so much of what were doing in the united states is out there on the internet and all of that can be taken down at once
5296645 this is such a crucial issue at every level our security now is dependent on computers
5296646 its a whole new era political and military conflicts now will almost always have a cyber component the chief targets will be critical infrastructure and the attacks will emerge from within our own computer systems
5296647 it only takes a couple of experts it doesnt take a whole cyber infantry division to pull something like this off
5296648 for a very small investment in resources you can have a huge impact
5296649 when it comes to our government it security were pretty strong in protecting against attacks
5296650 we can command so much bandwidth that its hard to overwhelm our servers
5296651 we are vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks but right now most of the people who want to do us harm dont have those capabilities
5296652 youd see some disruption of essential services like electricity youd definitely see espionage
5296653 would it be decisive no nobodys going to win a conflict with the united states in cyberspace but would it be disruptive and irritating yes
5296654 we dont know quite what the rules are for this kind of conflict if its spying its illegal but is it an act of war and who do you arrest
5296655 were much safer in the u s than we were a year ago but we still have a long way to go
5296656 we have to work harder to get them in the door and satisfy them its about capturing their attention
5296657 its about girls seeing celebrities on tv shows movie and concert tours and now they get to communicate about clothing on social networking sites more communicating tools are available to spread the word about fashion a celebrity is wearing that drives tween fashion
5296658 a lot of the very fashionable looks right now are very modest
5296659 its almost a flashback to looking very demure and proper
5296660 girls are dressing for themselves as opposed to dressing for guys
5296661 the guys might not like it but the girls are not wearing really tight shirts theyre covered up
5296662 what were looking for today is some evidence that would signal to us that there is an underlying heart problem
5296663 there are things that we can pick up with an electrocardiogram or with echocardiography that we may need to follow and in some cases could be career ending
5296664 if you walk into a medical facility and request these same tests you would spend well over a thousand dollars
5296665 it will take a period of three hours my physicals usually take 15 minutes
5296666 there are many kids who come here and never really had a complete physical exam let alone an echocardiogram or an ekg
5296667 just like a used car you can shine it up but none of us think twice about buying it unless we took it for a test drive and had a mechanic look at it
5296668 it just measures the electrical voltage that your heart puts out the thing we look for here is your heart rhythm is it normal
5296669 so youve passed this first leg of the heart screening
5296670 were looking for abnormal heart thickening meaning a portion of the heart wall is thicker than another
5296671 you always wonder if somethings wrong its better to find out early than find out later

5296676 in the middle east 100 million people in the arab countries many of whom have considered us their enemy for nearly 20 years now look on us as their friends we must continue to build on that friendship so that peace can settle at last over the middle east and so that the cradle of civilization will not become its grave

5296682 he was integral he played a key role he was trusted by other members of this site so much so that he stored horrific images of child abuse on their behalf
5296683 he described the 250 000 child abuse images as his collection he was prepared to share that with acquaintances he found on his forum
5296684 this site would have existed without him but it would not have been operating as effectively
5296685 the combined undercover operation was of the type never seen before
5296686 there were more police undercover assets coordinated through ceop than in any other investigation in respect of child abuse in this country
5296687 it is the first of its kind but it is not the last we were able to go further to dig deeper and identify patterns of behaviour and the evidence to hold these individuals to account more effectively
5296688 it is not rhetoric when we say to predators that wherever you go you leave a digital footprint and we will take you down

5296711 our soccer team is not here with our best but we are hoping that they could hang in there and pull some surprises even if they dont win the gold our boxers are not above average the track and field team is just there no name for any surprise except something happens in the relays
5296712 they are so willing to help in every situation they come to you even when you dont need them they are nice people and most of them are students im impressed about the games village the media village the facilities and general organisation but they are spending so much to host these games look at new structures the stadiums especially the birds nest so much money

5296714 we know that he will not be dealing with matters concerning refereeing only but we hope he will represent us fairly as he understands our problems
5296715 it is disappointing that some retailers appear to be failing in their responsibility to ensure these goods are not sold to young people store owners need to ensure that all staff are trained in this area and act upon this training every time they make a sale

5296722 we are not the first team to lose by 4 0 you saw what chelsea did against portsmouth yesterday there is nothing new about a team losing 4 0
5296723 losing by such a margin against kaizer chiefs is not the end of the road for us if you understand football this is one of the things that happen in football its good that it happened at the beginning of the season and by the time the league kicks off we will have rectified all the mistakes we committed against chiefs

5296767 we are aiming to complete the job within 90 minutes and if we go to the penalties then we know we have failed but that does not mean we will go into the shootout without hope it is only that our plan is to finish them early in the game
5296768 we represent the whole of ramotswa now that we are the only team from the village left in the competition and i can confidently promise balete that we will make them proud come sunday i do not think naughty boys got promoted by default they have also done well to reach this stage but we are ready for the challenge we have a committed squad which is capable of competing with premier league teams
5296769 it was the same at the play offs we went there with very little information on the teams but we managed to come tops
5296770 to me it is not an easy draw their confidence keeps growing with every game and they could be dangerous but the main challenge for me is that i do not know them maybe they know us but i do not know their style maybe if we played them last season i would know what their approach is this makes planning for them more difficult

5296837 he had a wonderful time tall and slender full head of hair extremely knowledgeable and confident about what he was doing
5296838 i was driving one of the cars and we noticed he was coming out and sort of standing there so eddie said roll the window down and ask isaac if he needs a ride
5296839 when i think back i remember the impression he made on us
5296840 i believe he probably helped and encouraged a lot of people in the music business and made a great impression
5296841 i found him to be a nice down to earth guy he didnt have to come up to me but he took the time to work the room

5296849 yeah he stopped using freshly made sauce years ago he gets a canned pizza sauce now and he stopped using fresh mozzarella from faiccos pork store just two doors down around the same time i dont even think he gets the sausage from faiccos anymore i talked to him for the book pizza a slice of heaven and it was like he was almost proud of it
5296850 that said the pizza is still better than you can find at 95 percent of the pizzerias in this country

5296907 although android will indeed start as a mobile os google intends to expand it to be a sort of universal operating system that will span set top boxes for televisions mp3 players and other communication and media devices and services
5296908 if creating applications for set top boxes was more like creating applications for the web wed be able to do a lot more things with our tvs especially if those set top boxes were also connected to the web want instant messaging and caller id on your tv no problem want customized information widgets for the tv that scroll breaking news weather sports scores or stock quotes from sources you choose in your own ticker at the bottom of the screen no problem want to turn that annoying ticker off no problem want to control the camera angles on that basketball game no problem want to add the live video stream from your friends cell phone who is at the game no problem want to create your own video mashup of fight scenes from various movies that you can edit right on your tv and share with others on their tvs no problem

5296918 gojan is a very strong boxer he proved it here there is no need to see videos because he knew how indian boxed in earlier bout
5296919 it was not my day i tried my best i watched gojans video but i could not match him in this bout
5296920 well win is a win and medal is a medal i failed winning the bout and in the process lost the medal
5296921 if i can celebrate my win i can also take the defeat
5296922 in boxing first two rounds virtually decide the bout because once you take the lead you start protecting it and this is what gojan did and i would have done the same if i had been in his position
5296923 not only them boxers but i will also cheer the wrestlers and the athletes and encourage them to win a medal
5296924 i am very unhappy with the result because akhil had beaten the world champion and now lost to an unheralded boxer
5296925 this is the first time that any university has refused to honour the provisions of an expired collective agreement until its replacement is negotiated in the absence of a strike or lockout the consequences of that refusal are staggering without a collective agreement academic staff at the university of sudbury will be forced to work without tenure without academic freedom without rights of collegial governance and without any of the other protections that are the basic requirements of the academic workplace by withholding these constitutive elements that protect the integrity of academic research and teaching the university of sudbury ceases to be a university in anything but name
5296926 it is important to note that the strike is not about bringing pressure to negotiate but rather is a defensive move to establish the existence and basic rights of unionized faculty
5296927 evangelical christianity is now tragically below the new testament standard worldliness is an accepted part of our way of life our religious mood is social instead of spiritual we have lost the art of worship we are not producing saints our models are successful business men celebrated athletes and theatrical personalities we carry on our religious activities after the methods of the modern advertiser our literature is shallow and our hymnody borders on sacrilege and scarcely anyone appears to care

5296929 it was my first time back in finland for quite a long time
5296930 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obama s varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5296931 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5296932 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent
5296933 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5296934 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5296935 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5296936 would not take any move to save the poor market
5296937 the larger concern over slowing growth in the economy will continue to weigh
5296938 so far the burden has all been on companies because theres so much overcapacity no one has any room to pass on the costs
5296939 we are starting to see companies going out of business after six to 12 months the survivors will have less competition and be able to raise prices more but its a very slow gradual process
5296940 all of the indicators this year have been within expectations the economy has slowed down to prevent inflation
5296941 the spending numbers have been quite good recently but it could be because of the olympics there seems to be a lot of related spending
5296942 theres been so much excitement generated it seems hard to me to say that we wont see some sort of short term hangover at least

5296951 if you want to receive push e mail you ll have to use google s gmail it s unclear that the phone will support microsoft exchange
5296952 the phone will have access to upcoming t mobile app store which will be very similar to apple s store featuring third party iphone applications only t mobile will likely place fewer restrictions on software developers so that android phone users may have more games and productivity apps to choose from
5296953 the phone will come with google s advertising software pre installed customers who opt in to receive mobile ads from google may be offered to buy the phone for a lower price and may also pay lower monthly service fees the google platform will serve ads based on your interests and location provided by the phone
5296954 the android phone will hit stores around thanksgiving not in september october as some news outlets have reported
5296955 if indeed youll have to use gmail for push e mail thats troubling clearly lots of people use other services today and many businesses may be hesitant to abandon their current e mail systems
5296956 the gmail mandate also raises all those old hairy questions about just how much control google will exercise over the android project lots of the worlds best independent developers and software companies actually compete with google and if they sense that google is always getting the upper hand with android they will not back this phone end users will suffer as they wont have access to the best applications out there

5296966 os or amentos s o cada vez mais rigorosos pelo que importante alimentarmos a equipa principal com jogadores vindos das camadas jovens por forma a pouparmos dinheiro
5296967 nos dois ltimos anos estivemos bem pr ximos de vencer o campeonato mas o facto de o fc porto ter contado com o factor casa na final revelou se decisivo por isso considero que fundamental ficarmos em primeiro na fase regular
5296968 o ricardo pereira j foi treinado por mim durante v rios anos e conhece me bastante bem j conquist mos juntos dois campeonatos nacionais quanto ao tiago rafael ele j jogou nas selec es com muitos jogadores do actual plantel por isso eles v o adaptar se bem

5296970 people look over the old heads basically the fans who are over 25
5296971 people look over them i dont thats my wheelhouse my true fans are probably 10 years younger than me 10 years older than me that world doesnt buy a lot of records now but its my job to get them to check for what im doing
5296972 my record is catering towards the mature hip hop fan
5296973 the kids might be able to get with it but it aint just playing it aint just partying its reality to me this album raw footage is a real spiritual record i dont know if ive ever mentioned god on as many records as i do on raw footage but its a lot that needs to be said its an instructional record too hopefully some of these people can sidestep some of these pitfalls out there once they hear raw footage
5296974 thats a decision that will be a tough call at the end
5296975 he will be involved in that decision at the end absolutely
5296976 right now if i said anything about the roster it would be premature it really would
5296977 i like the player and his teammates like him and he produces but it is a couple games and we have a ways to go here
5296978 give me a desk and a tv and decent chair and nice fields and thats really what we get used to
5296979 so in that respect this place is very comfortable the one thing i will not miss is the bubble or the moldy smell or anything that went with that like the darkness
5296980 packers tickets were hard to come by but the toughest ticket for me was the preseason i would have all my friends come out and family come for the preseason then during the regular season i was just giving my tickets away to teammates it was a very important time very stressful time

5297007 such was the deluge that it was greater than anyone expected
5297008 this is the first time i make a similar mistake when performing my routine there is always a first time but it is unfortunate that it had to happen in beijing i had a shot at the medal but failed i apologize to all those who expected a medal i never promised one but had the capability to win it maybe this is why i made the mistake i just burned out the draw was also unfavorable
5297009 i need rest now i have some tournaments and then i am going to decide
5297010 the italian olympic committee bought economy class plane tickets for all the athletes without any disparity between the various sports
5297011 if then some individual national federation like the soccer federation has chosen to increase the budget for a change in class it is a decision which has nothing to do with us
5297012 i didnt assume that whatever bob joseph and i agreed upon was going right into the presidents desk in the oval office
5297013 within this context now finally clarified by foley bob josephs decision to make an unremarkable call to a friend who rarely saw tenet or his seventh floor disciples and not tell this friend that hes the last check in one of modern historys most contentious phrases before it ends up on the presidents lips was a perfect way to get something cia doubted and its director had already opposed into the big speech
5297014 believed there may well have been something to the claims that the iraqis sought to purchase uranium from niger
5297015 the italian letter how the bush administration used a fake letter to build the case for war in iraq
5297016 if the president wants to go to war our job is to find the intelligence to allow him to do so
5297017 i was told that foley had focused on clearing the speech for sources and methods rather than for substance
5297018 in other words as long as the language didnt give away any secrets about how the intelligence was collected they didnt worry about whether we believed the assertions in the speech were accurate that was a terrible mistake our job was never to clear solely for sources and methods but also for substance and the last time i looked as good as the british intelligence service is and it is very good it does not work for the president of the united states
5297019 better black television has been a vision of mine for some years
5297020 ive done a lot to promote and change the way messages are relayed to our children and our families over the last few years
5297021 in addition im excited to be able to expose the urban community to a vast array of jobs in the entertainment community that they might not otherwise be privy to i have a great relationship with bet and mtv and my son and i will continue to do work with them and support their networks with bbtv were spearheading the initiative to meet consumer demand for family friendly hip hop content
5297022 i remember bob johnson founder of bet telling me back in the day that if you wanted to know real estate youve got to hang out with real estate investors if you wanted to know sports youve got to hang out with athletes i wanted to know tv so i hung out with bob and learned the tv game from one of the best in the business
5297023 were extremely proud of our programming that will be airing on bbtv
5297024 its extremely important to feed clean quality and positive subject matter to our families we believe tv content can be positive and responsible and still have good ratings with great content bbtv will offer all kinds of family friendly entertainment that everyone can enjoy our mission is to target the new generation of responsible african american and multi ethnic english speaking american and family oriented and responsible hip hop consumers who are taking charge of their families and striving for a better tomorrow
5297025 hear me all of you and understand 15 there is nothing outside a person that by going into him can defile him but the things that come out of a person are what defile him
5297026 then are you also without understanding do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile him 19 since it enters not his heart but his stomach and is expelled
5297027 what comes out of a person is what defiles him
5297028 we sin because we are sinners were not sinners because we sin
5297029 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5297030 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5297031 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5297032 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5297033 wir haben grunds tzlich interesse an britischen flugh fen auch an gatwick
5297034 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5297035 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5297036 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5297037 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5297038 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5297039 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5297040 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5297041 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5297042 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5297043 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

5297050 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5297051 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5297052 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5297053 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

5297055 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5297056 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

5297089 these findings are important because while genes that cause hpe have been identified the interactions among those that produce hpe are not only complex but poorly understood
5297090 this represents a first step in understanding the mechanism of that interaction
5297091 this is good evidence for what has been called the multi hit model of hpe
5297092 in this model it takes mutations in both six3 and other genes in the sonic hedgehog pathway to produce the severe pathology of hpe
5297093 sonic hedgehog is a major player in embryonic development in the brain as well as elsewhere in the body
5297094 so this new understanding of its regulation in this very limited time and place in the brain helps us understand at a molecular level some of its overall role in brain formation

5297101 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5297102 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5297103 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent senator obama
5297104 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory

5297203 na poca n o dei muita import ncia para fazer minha escolha e fui enquadrado automaticamente no b sico s que hoje tenho a impress o de que eu teria uma conta mais enxuta se optasse pelo alternativo mas para isso preciso da conta detalhada que a operadora me deve h uns tr s meses e n o envia assim fica dif cil mensurar qual o melhor plano
5297204 muitos consumidores s tiveram acesso s regras dos planos b sico e alternativo muito depois que foram implantados como quem n o se manifestou foi automaticamente migrado para o b sico muitos ficaram no preju zo por n o se enquadrarem no perfil deste plano
5297205 mesmo com as informa es muitos consumidores prefeririam ficar no plano b sico at para ver como seria a contagem de minutos em suas contas mas est o come ando a perceber a necessidade de mudar de plano porque est ficando caro
5297206 n o que a conta ficou mais cara que as pessoas n o se manifestaram e ficaram no plano b sico no qual quem fala mais de t s minutos teve um custo exponencialmente mais caro na conta
5297207 teve gente que ficou no plano b sico mesmo n o tendo o perfil porque houve falta de compreens o da diferen a entre os dois pacotes
5297208 as operadoras n o fornecem um detalhamento na conta das liga es a menos que o consumidor pe a e ainda assim existem relatos de que esse servi o n o esta funcionando bem dessa forma imposs vel para o consumidor entender sua conta seus gastos e suas necessidades

5297233 for the worst kind of medical mistakes including operating on the wrong body part or the wrong person or giving someone the wrong blood
5297234 when you look at these adverse events these are pretty gross errors
5297235 i think that we are just ambling along and making our way at present i think we are drifting a bit i dont really see any clear signals in terms of going in a certain direction and certainly this whole question of empowering people and creating a situation in which bahamians feel that this is their country and they have a say in what happens i dont see that happening
5297236 it bahamianization policy will be a way of life accepted by most people and one that most people can buy into and work towards right now most bahamians feel like they dont have any say in what happens
5297237 we need to have a policy that really brings more people into the decision making and find ways of doing it we really need some real planning and we are not really good at planning as a nation
5297238 we should be able to say that in 10 years time this is where we want to be a country must have some idea of where it is headed and in todays bahamas we seem to be headed from one budget speech to the next interspersed with some news about this foreigner or the next foreigner coming in to spend some money or bring some plan
5297239 where is the national plan and where does all of this fit into a national plan
5297240 what was bahamian is largely influenced by external forces and external factors
5297241 to add insult to injury we live in a country where the economy is determined by outsiders outsiders decide the fate of bahamians unfortunately as a country we dont seem to be interested in reversing that trend but i would hate to be in a bahamas that puts a curtain around the whole bahamas that stops the outsiders from coming in but i would be happier if we were living in a situation where we were able to determine our destiny in a far greater degree than we presently are
5297242 in terms of morality my recollection of my teenage days and earlier there was a lot of immorality around and we had the same teenage pregnancy problems and illegitimacy was real although the present figures are higher now than they were then but fundamentally we are different now because our assumptions are different
5297243 and there was a man who came to him and asked master what good deed must i do to possess eternal life jesus said to him why do you ask me about what is good there is one alone who is good but if you wish to enter into life keep the commandments he said which these jesus replied you must not kill you must not commit adultery you must not bring false witness honour your father and mother and you must love your neighbour as yourself the young man said to him i have kept all these what more do i need to do jesus said if you wish to be perfect go and sell what you own and give the money to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven then come follow me but when the young man heard these words he went away sad for he was a man of great wealth

5297261 i felt like putting a bullet between the eyes of every panda that wouldnt screw to save its species
5297262 i look at health care and access to health care to be as much a basic human right as food housing heat in winter and cool in the extremes of summer
5297263 what im trying to convey is that their health is worth it for me to receive a smaller amount of fees for the services i provide if you are serious about taking care of yourself im serious about helping you
5297264 hello how are you my friend youre getting fatter what happened
5297265 to start off we misread the wicket a bit we thought it may not seam or swing that much as the breeze was strong we expected it to swing throughout the day which it did but i think there was a fair bit in the wicket to start off
5297266 the sri lankan bowlers bowled really well the top two batsmen they got out not due to a bad shot they got out of their defence the credit goes to their fast bowlers i think they got wickets
5297267 later on ajantha mendis put the pressure and the only thing we were doing was to catch up and it really gets tough in the one dayers if you lose too many wickets upfront
5297268 if you see muralitharan and mendis they are different bowlers
5297269 whether its to get high or deal with stress or if they mistakenly believe it will help them perform better in school or
5297270 dang you could practically ski off that nose if i had all that money id look up a surgeon

5297272 you have to say that this is no longer a music contest i have to decide whether i want to do this again western european participants have to decide whether they want to to take part from here on in because their prospects are poor

5297277 since were only on day four of our implementation lets just say if apps were on my baseball team it would be hitting at the bottom of the lineup
5297278 for me as the google apps administrator the disruption was pretty damn irritating aside from getting kicked out of e mail i need to do my own job it also forced me to completely refocus on figuring out whats happening with gmail and google apps
5297279 it was constant troubleshooting testing research posting to the google apps forums and so on plus theres the emotional strain of wondering whether you completely screwed up by moving everyone to google apps as our sole e mail system thats what freaked me out did google just make me look like an idiot
5297280 mostly that 20 percent drop is based on fear of another perhaps more damaging outage it hasnt happened but now i know it could happen any time and without warning and if it does i have virtually no recourse to get the service running again
5297281 if we began to experience a similar outage more than about two or three business hours per quarter wed probably make google apps and gmail a backup solution to a locally hosted mail system if we used it at all and it would likely be years before wed try a cloud based collaborative system again from any vendor
5297282 even though weve only had apps for a few days im already impressed with the customization options the ability to completely ditch outlook makes apps a worthwhile service to our company
5297283 the gmail interface feels more intuitive and is significantly quicker than outlook and the mobile accessibility is a huge improvement over our old e mail service
5297284 google understands its tremendous responsibility to keep things up and running
5297285 no ones happy when theres downtime but theres always downtime ive seen exchange go down often many times youre left to your own it people to fix it that can be good or bad id rather it be googles problem theyve got a world class team their reputation is on the line over time theyre going to get better and better

5297288 the larger concern over slowing growth in the economy will continue to weigh
5297289 so far the burden has all been on companies because theres so much overcapacity no one has any room to pass on the costs
5297290 we are starting to see companies going out of business after six to 12 months the survivors will have less competition and be able to raise prices more but its a very slow gradual process
5297291 all of the indicators this year have been within expectations the economy has slowed down to prevent inflation
5297292 the spending numbers have been quite good recently but it could be because of the olympics there seems to be a lot of related spending
5297293 theres been so much excitement generated it seems hard to me to say that we wont see some sort of short term hangover at least

5297351 most of the people we see discovered they have chronic hepatitis c when they went to donate blood or had a physical exam in order to get insurance
5297352 about one third of people with chronic hepatitis will go on to develop cirrhosis of the liver
5297353 only 5 to 10 percent will develop liver cancer in other words many people can live perfectly well with chronic hepatitis infection and never have any problems the trouble is we cant tell who will do well and who will die of the disease
5297354 i can usually get anyone through two or three months of interferon and ribavirin beyond that it gets really tough
5297355 at least 10 percent of patients cant make it through the recommended course of therapy
5297356 if virus levels drop off very quickly we can shorten the course of therapy if the response is slow we can lengthen it sometimes to as much as 72 weeks and improve the chances of success
5297357 not surprisingly people with a history of depression are at greater risk
5297358 all we had at first was a bunch of dots on a map
5297359 weve made a lot of progress against hepatitis c but theres still a lot to do

5297368 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
5297369 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
5297370 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

5297373 these measures all add up to a very significant package we are talking of about maybe s 700 million a year if more babies are born it will be more than s 700 million a year but even that is about double of what we are spending today on child incentives and all together we will have about s 1 6 billion spent a year or 0 6 per cent of gdp

5297496 today the shadow of dictatorship that has prevailed for long over this country that chapter has been closed
5297497 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5297498 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5297499 i pray the government stops this downward slide and takes the country out of this crisis
5297500 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual
5297501 that is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership
5297502 pakistan and the united states have a joint interest in fighting terror

5297504 what are they doing where are they going whats happening i dont get it any more they lost me i still appreciate what theyre doing or what theyre trying to do but i think theyre trying too hard not to be radiohead that seems a little ridiculous to me
5297505 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5297506 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5297507 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5297508 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5297509 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5297510 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5297511 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5297512 the only problem with the new south africa is that it is full of old south africans
5297513 but it is not uncommon in this sport to compete with three members
5297514 the negotiations will continue under the facilitation of president mbeki
5297515 it is our expectation as zanu pf that a deal will be concluded in the fullness of time so that we can put behind us the divisions conflict the polarisation that in fact has divided our country
5297516 they were elected for five years and already five months of that is gone without performing the functions of their office
5297517 sooner or later parliament must convene mps must be sworn in and we carry on with the business of running the country

5297532 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
5297533 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
5297534 as the commission proceeds it is my hope that it gives all due consideration to all proposals concerning the best use of the white spaces including those proposals to license some or all of the spectrum available
5297535 the investigation into the bombing has begun and there are many interpretations political interpretations
5297536 once again they want our country to be an arena for settling scores and battling for influence
5297537 feared that the spate of bloody violence in tripoli could spread to ain al hilweh and the bekaa
5297538 devising a national strategy to rebuild the lebanese state as well as a strategy to settle the countrys deep rooted social and economic problems are two crucial items to be discussed
5297539 the residents of the camp have the right to live in security peace and stability
5297540 we want to sleep without hearing the sound of gunfire
5297541 the pullback is welcome because many commodities had reached prohibitive levels hindering commerce and really hurting the modest budgets of the poor working poor in developing countries
5297542 however too much of a price slide in commodities would be a sign of a pronounced global economic slowdown which is something we dont want
5297543 in many cases what youve seen is simply institutional investors chasing return on equity first we had strong demand for key commodities which drove prices up then institutional investors entered the market in a major way further driving up prices
5297544 the latter tactic was exaggerated by the use of commodities as surrogates for the sluggish stock market
5297545 thus far it looks like a considerable reduction in inflation in emerging markets countries like china may see drop to the 5 5 6 5 level from the 7 8 5 level for inflation
5297546 as we continue to grow our environment were looking at trying to put together a plan to bring in two system z9s
5297547 in the last two to three years weve realized that doing business on the mainframe was a very sound idea
5297548 as we continue to grow our environment were looking at trying to put together a plan to bring in two system z9s
5297549 eu a mulher mais sexy do mundo acredito que qualquer coisa na vida deva ser entendida com uma dose gigantesca de ironia sobretudo na minha profiss o esse t tulo um grande elogio mas todos sabemos que a mulher mais sexy do mundo n o existe
5297550 nunca fui contr ria ao casamento mas desde pequena sempre me considerei diferente de minhas amigas elas colecionavam fotos de vestidos de noiva eu nunca tive esse desejo
5297551 quero viver em um pa s onde todos t m direitos iguais agora sou cidad norte americana e me entristece pensar que o amor de alguns n o seja considerado igual ao amor de outros
5297552 im really stable psychologically i think my polish colleague was more stressed
5297553 that was the emotion that came naturally because i spent a lot of time preparing for this moment and i just couldnt hold back my tears
5297554 i really didnt know i was going to be in the scrap business
5297555 we run it as if we were a much bigger company and that makes it very easy
5297556 a lot of people dont understand our operation or what we do
5297557 without this service our cities and landfills would be overrun with metal very quickly
5297558 the point of purchase is only one part of it
5297559 it impacts me whether im in a park or in my own home
5297560 you cant look at a map and see 7 000 little red dots representing present and future wells and say thats not going to impact the air quality in fort worth that is just foolish
5297561 public health and safety first and then environment right under that clean air clean water or rather how gas drilling impacts the air we breathe and the groundwater and surface water
5297562 i understand the money part billions and billions of dollars but theres a tradeoff for that
5297563 and i think a really progressive city sometimes has to just say no to the money
5297564 and that was just like a bullet to my temple
5297565 i said you cant be serious and at that point i knew nothing about gas drilling i hadnt kept up with it at all so thats when i started educating myself
5297566 natural gas companies arent aware that this isnt just a vacant lot or undeveloped land
5297567 its also one of the most unique ecosystems in the whole state of texas
5297568 we recognized this was a city problem not a neighborhood problem
5297569 i think don young is a passionate advocate for environmental concerns in the city the quality of life of the city of fort worth
5297570 and hes very concerned that we have very little green space left in the urbanized part of our city and he wants to do whatever he can to protect that
5297571 we respect all opinions and viewpoints including those of mr young
5297572 he has the right to his opinion but he doesnt have the right to be wrong in his facts what should concern his followers is if theyre getting accurate information and what his motives are
5297573 when anybody questions the industry or has issues or legitimate concerns its very fair to have those aired to have those questions addressed
5297574 but when someones mind is closed from the beginning who doesnt want to see another viewpoint or look for areas of common interest who resorts to name calling or ridicule its a different story
5297575 its so easy to get burned out and feel hopeless
5297576 frankly i burn out myself occasionally but i keep coming back
5297577 my wife and i have decided weve had enough were going to fight this out for the next couple years but were planning to move
5297578 recognize they are going through a lot of changes this year
5297579 when you start putting all these smaller ones under one umbrella im worried were going to lose focus
5297580 were just trying to figure out a way to balance the budget
5297581 staff worked hard to take things into consideration things will have to be taken out for anything to be added in
5297582 i hadnt been to the building since the 1990s so i didnt know anything about the program
5297583 but when i saw those girls and where they were living ive got college age children and my heart immediately went out to them it is a fine space but the plaster was peeling the roof was leaking black mold was in the bathrooms i saw that many others would have to be involved
5297584 i tell people i have the best job on earth and when good things like this happen it makes it even better the girls are just so excited
5297585 its their space and even though it wont be theirs forever we want them to feel at home and we want for the next girl there to feel at home
5297586 in the spirit of it takes a village what a fantastic program for these young ladies to be taken in and given a place to live and taught life skills whereas they wouldnt have received that before
5297587 the ywca is a tremendous agency and we were honored to be asked to participate in this
5297588 the event is the first official one in the ballroom
5297589 ive told them all though that as soon as they give me some finished kitchens ill cook for them
5297590 its tear jerking to see that people are becoming more compassionate for homeless people than when i was homeless
5297591 when you see a homeless woman walking the streets with all her bags or pushing a basket all dirty that was me for seven years
5297592 for seven years i didnt know anything but living homeless doing crime and drugs
5297593 i had been on the streets with all the crime and drug addicts where i had been beaten up raped and called names i was afraid of society
5297594 i wanted to become the person i was before i was diagnosed
5297595 im an advocate for homelessness im an advocate for people living with hiv who dont speak out for themselves ive learned you have to be proactive
5297596 samaritan house is a place where people come to get their lives back in order so they can transition back into society its part of what makes housing my passion
5297597 when i walk through and see all the happy faces of people living with hiv and aids and who are self sufficient and active and not ashamed i just feel so good
5297598 this disease is not gone there are more infections occurring every day in this country now than there ever were
5297599 thats why we sent her there it was an investment to remind people here and for her to be able to go to africa and educate people there
5297600 the city i am so happy to say has finalized a plan for homelessness housing is the first step we know that works here
5297601 its amazing after they get their health back in a stable environment and after they see from the people around them whats possible human nature takes over at that point
5297602 its exciting to watch the changes to watch the excitement build in their lives the way they start planning for the future to see them finding their way and to see them giving back and wanting to move back into the community thats what launching is all about its all about getting a second chance
5297603 when i came here this was like my last chance
5297604 being here really brought me out of my shell a lot of my dreams and goals ive reached are because i was here im thankful for samaritan house because its taught me how to not be scared but how to have courage and how to not give up your dreams dreams do come true you just have to believe in them
5297605 i literally do not know where id be or what i would be doing if i hadnt come here
5297606 i had lost so many things and so many opportunities they have opened so many doors for me this place helps a lot of people and it takes a lot of people off the streets who would otherwise be wandering around
5297607 he misses everything hes struggling to do things right but thats just him he cant hardly call the play right he gets confused i dont know what it is he just has a tough time
5297608 oh right you want to get to love me first
5297609 no i gave the hug first and its up to me when the hug ends
5297610 i cant give up i have to keep on fighting not for me but for my son
5297611 remember that you are a gift and not everyone gets to unwrap that same gift if that were true then there would be no worth and you know you are worthy
5297612 friends are those angels that lift you to your feet when your own wings have forgotten how to fly

5297615 the big western debate is whether this is about georgia or russia
5297616 those who want to contain the damage say that georgia is a little country partly to blame and not worth the confrontation with moscow then there are those who say this is really about russia and the rules of the game for europe writ large for the caspian energy corridor and the right of small countries to choose their own path
5297617 how do they square their increasing energy dependence on russia with their increasing political discomfort with putin its a very hard circle to square
5297618 will only be reinforced in its view that georgia and ukraine are not ready for nato
5297619 there is little disagreement now in europe about the nature of the new russia
5297620 europe is torn between old and new europe but i dont see europe prepared to go to war with itself over georgia the european foreign ministers sense this is too big for them and they will in the end align themselves with the united states while trying to affect policy
5297621 nato never developed military plans to defend central and eastern europeans because we said russias not an enemy and not a threat and we never backed up the new members with exercises and infrastructure
5297622 that we are building muscle and getting stronger for our sport that we like to play
5297623 gives me something fun to do at night and gets me in great shape
5297624 i like you lift weights and exercise to get strong

5297626 evidence was put before the director of public prosecutions last night and the decision was taken to charge two men a 17 year old and a 20 year old
5297627 a number of individuals were detained and questioned this week as a result of a proactive police operation
5297628 consequently some have been charged with drug related offences unconnected to the mullanys murder
5297629 at this stage we are not in a position to disclose any further information regarding these individuals
5297630 so far as the two females arrested and charged last week they are still remanded in custody at her majestys prison
5297631 again we are not in a position to disclose any details regarding their arrests and charges except to say they are linked to the other three persons presently in police custody
5297632 through lack of foresight and planning allowed a range of industries to arise that let people steal music
5297633 le reazioni ai quattro angoli del mondo non sono state dissimili da quelle che si sarebbero avute se le olimipiadi si fossero fatte in africa e i giocatori spagnoli si fossero fatti ritrarre con le facce dipinte di nero come le caramelle tab gonne di paglia e delle grosse sveglie appese al collo
5297634 my toughest competition is ignorance the lack of knowledge that we even exist
5297635 it only takes seven seconds to make the first impression and you only get to do it once
5297636 you never know when youre going to meet your next potential boss
5297637 its not that youre telling them they look bad its a chance for the employee to benefit from their job
5297638 what we do is take about 15 measurements for both men and women and put it into a computer which prints out a book about 150 pages long
5297639 it tells them every neckline possible every length of jacket they can wear from dress styles to necklaces how long their hairstyles should be to lingerie swimsuits and shorts
5297640 sabe o que eu acho que voc precisa de um cara todo errado
5297641 the only reason that a wiki works is because the community of people who work on it make it work
5297642 these 1 000 or so science blogs provide authoritative opinions about pressing issues in science such as evolution or climate change or aim to engage other scientists in open and frank discussions about the scientific literature or science policy because of their freewheeling nature these blogs take scientific communication to a different level
5297643 how long did it take the government to hold a discussion of the release of 200 terrorists including two who caused the murder of israelis no more than three minutes all this without having an depth discussion and without hearing the positions of the security arms

5297651 weve got a voice a voice that kids listen to
5297652 its so important that we get involved in this so important that we believe that things can change because no one wants to pack their children off to school and never see them again

5297664 they asked what it would take for me to use
5297665 the circumstances are extremely tragic and they being investigated by the mciu which will be looking at all factors that may have caused the accident
5297666 the reality is that like a lot of local people i tend to watch local government and i think the majority of people who do would be disappointed recently
5297667 its a bizarre election in that many people will actually stand on sensible governance i think rather than on two or three other important issues
5297668 although there is plenty that is going on and people might have their individual issues governance is the most important
5297669 that is what im standing on simple governance issues like that people should be transparent in what their conflicts of interest are on what their political affiliations are
5297670 personally i dont care if they are competent and can do the job for ballarat i dont care if they are called comrade come from trades hall or theyre from the business sector by another name
5297671 the only thing id personally be calling for is for other independent people local residents who think they can contribute something to local government and governance to join me
5297672 i am one of those people and im confident well get others like that to stand
5297673 im aware this office has used video taken by members of the public to successfully prosecute an offender in the past
5297674 my concerns are if you have got people driving around using mobile phones to video they would be breaking the law
5297675 also the safety aspect you dont want people running out on the street with video cameras and the like
5297676 we would encourage the public to notify crime stoppers of any hoon behaviour at no stage should someone use a camera to put themselves or anyone else in danger
5297677 the projects include drainage works for the thoroughtrack which is an all weather training track upgrading the existing hill track which is a 1400m track up mt pisgah and an upgrade to improve lighting on the track
5297678 it will be far safer the lighting will really brighten up dowling forest of a morning
5297679 as the number of horses continues to grow here these upgrades are outstanding and good news for us
5297680 it is great that the government sees fit to allocate funding to ballarat as one of the key training centres in victoria
5297681 its vital and everyone is looking forward to the upgrades
5297682 the thoroughtrack particularly at this time of the year in winter is important because you just dont get through a training program if you dont have this facility
5297683 it ensures that they are training seven days a week and i think the results with darren weir being the leading country trainer and sebastian murphy being australias leading apprentice speaks volumes about why it works
5297684 safety is one of the biggest issues that confronts the racing industry and this funding will help improve safety management and animal welfare and enhance the available facilities for riders trainers and associated staff
5297685 it was good to have some family there to support him
5297686 it was an easy race to watch because they led most of the way britians four best rowers beat them
5297687 we were totally thrilled it was a wonderful result we thought they might get on the podium
5297688 he said they could not have put in more effort he was very contented
5297689 i think its a fantastic win and a vindication for them because they felt they were good rowers they performed on a world stage
5297690 there are opportunities in prison for an individual who has blighted his life with drug addiction to take up the opportunity to engage in drug rehabilitation programs
5297691 the big emphasis will be on visiting repeat problem areas and where we have repeat offenders the unit will concentrate on those particular individuals and families to break the cycle of family violence
5297692 what the upsurge of reports show is that people are more confident in reporting these incidents where it used to be kept within the household and people were reluctant to report it

5297696 rowan was pilloried attacked and mocked but he got on with being the archbishop of canterbury
5297697 the term that rowan used were the bonds of affection that bind us
5297698 if we cant build on those then what are we doing here
5297699 rowan said gods watching us the worlds watching us if we dont handle our heritage with integrity then we fail in gods eyes
5297700 if we dont handle conflict then we have failed in the worlds eyes
5297701 rowan kept saying the west has the luxury of navel gazing while elsewhere many church groups are simply worried about feeding themselves
5297702 it was a bit of a shock for us because we anglicans like looking inwards
5297703 there were always those who wanted to fight and you knew who they were because they were always standing at the microphones
5297704 there have been 2000 years of church history and changes are many
5297705 my position is we change as a church not as an individual diocese
5297706 just because you think you can doesnt mean you should bishops have to preserve the heritage of the church but at the same time bishops have a prophetic role to bring the church into the modern world
5297707 heightened the dangers of getting sucked into a lukewarm church
5297708 its revived my passion for the continual movement of the church to engage more directly with the poor i think the more we do that the more authentic we become

5297805 ongoing developments in technology have increased both the markets and investors demand for more timely company disclosure on the web and in turn raised new securities law issues for public companies to consider
5297806 as a technical matter the release clarifies how information posted on a companys website may implicate certain provisions of the securities exchange act of 1934
5297807 to make broader use of their websites as the sole means of disseminating material information to investors
5297808 i dont see this transition happening overnight but for smaller public companies this will help lower costs and utilize a method of distributing information that they already utilize
5297809 simply posting material news on a corporate web site or using blogs does not meet the spirit and intent of regulation fd because it is neither simultaneous nor full and fair
5297810 the use of web sites as an ancillary means of news dissemination is in our view a best practice however web posting or blogs alone are not a substitute for secure and simultaneous push delivery of material news to the disclosure media financial markets online web portals aggregators and the global investing public neither does it accomplish the requirements of the major stock exchanges
5297811 the reason that people believe there needs to be a constitutional amendment some people believe is because uh of the concern that uh uh about same sex marriage im not somebody whos sic promotes same sec sic marriage but i do believe in civil unions i do believe that we should not um that that for a gay partners sic to want to visit each other in the hospital for the state to say you know what thats all right i dont think in any way inhibits my core beliefs about what marriage are sic

5297816 we played well and i think we can be happy with the way things are going for the club we conceded a couple of goals again but the most important thing was that we won
5297817 we have to look at it as a whole team and we know we need to do better defensively we cant concede too many goals like we did last season it would be great to eliminate that and still score a lot of goals
5297818 we are still happy with the start to the season we have made if we can keep scoring goals and start to concede fewer goals that is perfect
5297819 it is a new defence with a new goalkeeper and that will not develop overnight the new guys played well

5297840 i can safely predict that i will be in the top four at the end of the season because i have made some reinforcements to the team that struggled last season we had an agreement with police xi that they could offload to us players that they no longer needed
5297841 frankly speaking no one can say those players are ordinary that police xi have released them does not mean they are useless just watch them when the season starts
5297842 we are playing an experienced side which came second in the league and for my players to rub shoulders with them gu players is something big the mood in the camp is high but i must admit that it has to be controlled

5297844 this is a make or break meeting for us as it presents rollers with a chance to rebuild if you take our performance on and off the field since 2006 it has not been the same as we have different camps in the team people who want to advice are now seen as antagonists but i just hope that sanity will prevail and we will take rollers back to the glory days
5297845 it must be clarified who owns rollers and what is in store for the supporters the idea of privatising rollers was done in good faith and the current committee was appointed by the board of directors it has since turned out that the committee has extended their mandate as we have not had elections for the past four years therefore i think it is upon club members to see what they can do with the leadership
5297846 there is a need for situational analysis and see how we can get out of problems rollers need to get back to the situation where consultation is a norm these days people just take decisions and supporters are called to the ground to be told of those decisions some of us had volunteered to assist not to be part of the committee but we were rebuffed
5297847 we have wasted time on issues which were not helpful to the development of the team our fights with the bfa botswana football association and other teams did not help our cause at all

5298013 the announcement by president musharraf that he is standing down as president brings to a close a critical period in pakistans history and its relations with the uk and other countries

5298324 but i remember the day that ahp ba was rushed to the hospital i was outside while he was pruning that damn tree but i wasnt anywhere near him and i remember that eyepatch he had to wear for weeks afterwards
5298325 he looked like some awful korean caricature of zorro with that moustache he used to have
5298326 yeah well one day shortly after that eyepatch was removed i guess he was holding you up in his arms and you had some picture that you had painted at school that you wanted him to see and he wasnt looking at it so you kept waving it around and you cut him in his eye with it
5298327 a first grade picture is why hes blind in that eye but what about the doctor the bad guy doctor
5298328 i guess there were two doctors the first one after the tree incident did a good job but ahp ba had to go to the hospital again after you paper cut his eyeball since his eye was still recovering and thats the doctor that screwed up his eye
5298329 so basically right now youre telling me that if i hadnt waved around some first grade piece of watercolor shit or whatever it was and poked his eyeball with it he never would have had to see the doctor that fucked up his eye and caused him to become blind in that eye
5298330 it was still the doctor that fucked up his eye though

5298335 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
5298336 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
5298337 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
5298338 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
5298339 ive starting using the egg trick and ive been able to lower my commuting fuel costs by more than 10 per cent
5298340 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5298341 drop shotting is about presenting a soft plastic lure in a manner that is different from texas rigging or carolina rigging
5298342 you may get more bites with lighter line and smaller baits but when there is heavier cover a power version is required

5298353 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
5298354 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
5298355 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source

5298359 as a woman i have had to deal with men telling me that i cannot succeed in the industry purely because i am a woman
5298360 refused to publish the outcome of a meeting of liberian politicians who were in exile in freetown sierra leone
5298361 maybe rev bowier had intended to give me the resolution or outcome of that meeting but what he gave me was only a news script which had already been published and therefore there was no need to repeat what had already been reported
5298362 its the policy of this newspaper to publish such document in the interest of the public sometimes we paid for them and so in this case if a document was given without a cost why should we not publish it
5298363 today our office is a major research center because we keep these kinds of documents in my experience in the field of journalism such documents are never useless they can be used at certain time today such a document is useful
5298364 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5298365 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5298366 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5298367 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5298368 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5298369 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5298370 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5298371 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5298372 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5298373 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5298374 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5298375 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5298376 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5298377 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5298378 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5298379 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5298380 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5298381 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5298382 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5298383 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5298384 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5298385 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5298386 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5298387 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5298388 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5298389 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5298390 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5298391 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5298392 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5298393 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5298394 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks

5298397 june 28 2008 was a defining moment in my life
5298398 it was the day i shot and killed a man in the defense of my life and the lives of others we all have defining moments they might not be as tragic as taking another man s life but they are events that change the way we look at things or even perhaps how we live our lives
5298399 regardless of what obama might say about particular decisions obamas justices would not only presumably make up these new rights they would strip us of our second amendment rights while giving child rapists more rights and taking away the rights of the people through their legislators to make these important decisions

5298420 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5298421 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

5298427 nearly one billion us dollars have been reserved for the project to support yulia tymoshenko
5298428 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
5298429 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
5298430 america uses a lot of oil thats 25 percent of the worlds oil demand used by just 4 percent of the world population
5298431 the simple truth is that cheap and easy oil is gone
5298432 i think i would be for al gore for energy czar in an obama administration

5298461 eh why you banging your head against the computer screen like that
5298462 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
5298463 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
5298464 this is something that ive been thinking about for a long time
5298465 ive just found the idea of joining the army very appealing
5298466 most of my friends are going to be doctors and lawyers and that kind of thing but i just cant see myself doing that
5298467 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5298468 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5298469 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5298470 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
5298471 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
5298472 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
5298473 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
5298474 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
5298475 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
5298476 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
5298477 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
5298478 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
5298479 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
5298480 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
5298481 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
5298482 what do we have to give up to reach the cost of a trillion and a half to three trillion dollars theres going to have to be some pain some sacrifice on the part of the american taxpayer isnt there
5298483 the real way to bring gasoline prices down is not by going back to try more of the same things that have not worked in the past but to say wait a minute now is the time for a really dramatic shift over to renewable energy
5298484 he did not force gore to debate a crackpot from cloud cuckoo land who is still waiting for the evidence to arrive about human sources of radical climate change
5298485 the unsupported assumption catastrophic global warming follows burning fossil fuels requires immediate action
5298486 the unsupported assumption that the world is more than 6000 years old
5298487 he did not force gore to debate a crackpot from cloud cuckoo land who is still waiting for the evidence to arrive about human sources of radical climate change
5298488 that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared

5298495 her personal security travis was driving lisaraye was in the back seat i was in the passenger side of the jeep
5298496 we pulled up to her home we had been to the grocery store shed bought food to make tacos so we had groceries in the back of the car
5298497 we got up to the house the guards spoke to her and then proceeded to pick up the phone lisaraye said oh you dont have to pick up the phone to announce me but he proceeded to do so and closed the door to the guard shack with lisaraye standing there he caught her between the door and him her security travis then got out of the car and pulled the door so the guard would not hurt her
5298498 travis never touched the security guard at all lisaraye then walked through the guard house into the property of her home travis was behind her and i was sitting in the truck on the passenger side i then got behind the drivers seat and backed the truck up
5298499 but what ive been told by lisaraye and travis is that there was no belligerence
5298500 when they arrived michael was having a meeting with some of his ministers on the patio
5298501 i was told lisaraye came in she waved two of the people on the patio saw her but she didnt see michael michael then all of a sudden appeared and started walking up the walk toward the house
5298502 lisaraye was walking toward their library study and michael said you should not be here what are you doing here she said what are you talking about michael this is my home they went into the library and one of michaels security guards grabbed first ladys hand and snatched a recorder she had in her hand
5298503 pushed lisaraye and her guard out the front door of the house
5298504 she was treated and then after her treatment she went to the police department and we filed an initial complaint she was there for 6 hours
5298505 the original reason we came and were meeting with michael at michaels request is to come up with a settlement as far as temporary support until there is a decree and finally divorce jeter told us
5298506 so just like any woman from the states if you separate then theres spousal support until you get a final decree and then the final decree determines what the terms of the divorce will be whether theres property settlement or whatever it may be

5298523 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology

5298525 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves

5298541 we are elated to have salem as a new customer salem was quick to recognize the value of our then relatively new feature for riaa compliance in fact since salem cut over to streamaudio they have implemented many of our other premium software features along with a robust software system salem demands an error free high quality streaming service with an installed base of more than 50 media companies over 600 radio stations and commercial delivery of roughly 100 000 simultaneous streams to our customers listeners all day every day streamaudio has the capacity and experience to perform well for large groups
5298542 we had been considering streamaudio as our streaming vendor for some time mainly because of their feature rich software we started the migration of our streaming activities to streamaudio in early 2008 and the transition has gone very well at this time we have ninety radio stations streaming with streamaudio streamaudios streaming service and customer service has been excellent their streaming infrastructure and software is indeed one of the best in the industry and when we needed a feature that they did not have at the time they were quick to develop it for us also streamaudios compliance with the riaas royalty data collection requirements makes their solution very compelling
5298543 we are very pleased and proud to have salem communications as a customer
5298544 we started with a tall order from salem basically to cut over ninety radio stations in a very short period of time due to new requirements by the riaa it turns out that our task was much easier than expected because salem had a well defined conversion plan and their management sales staff and technical staff all took advantage of the training that we offer to all of our clients since we began salem has contributed several ideas that have lead to new features in our software repertoire we look forward to a long healthy relationship with salem

5298561 the surgery went as planned and annie is now recuperating at home annie would like to send her thanks and appreciation to all that have sent their well wishes in the past few days
5298562 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
5298563 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
5298564 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
5298565 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
5298566 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
5298567 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
5298568 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
5298569 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
5298570 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
5298571 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
5298572 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5298573 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5298574 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5298575 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5298576 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5298577 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5298578 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5298579 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5298580 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5298581 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5298582 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5298583 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world

5298585 everyone figured that the acaricides anti varroa mite chemicals would be present in the wax because the wax is reprocessed to form the structure of the hives
5298586 it was a bit of a shock to see the levels and the widespread presence of these pesticides
5298587 we already had in place ways to test for viruses bacteria and fungi but it was difficult to find an analytical laboratory that could analyze for unknown pesticides
5298588 we needed them to take a comprehensive look at all pesticides not just those associated with beekeeping
5298589 when we began doing this work honey was not regularly analyzed and bee pollen was not a commodity and so was not analyzed
5298590 we decided to go with the types of screening the lab does for milk and apples which look at over 170 pesticides now honey is included in the commodities to be analyzed
5298591 simplicity was important because there were many people across the country sampling for us
5298592 now rather than having them collect 15 grams of pollen they need only collect 3 grams
5298593 gamma radiation is often used to kill viruses and other disease causing agents
5298594 we are finding fungicides that function by inhibiting the steroid metabolism in the fungal diseases they target but these chemicals also affect similar enzymes in other organisms
5298595 these fungicides in combination with pyrethroids and or neonicotinoids can sometimes have a synergistic effect 100s of times more toxic than any of the pesticides individually
5298596 we do not know that these chemicals have anything to do with colony collapse disorder but they are definitely stressors in the home and in the food sources
5298597 pesticides alone have not shown they are the cause of ccd we believe that it is a combination of a variety of factors possibly including mites viruses and pesticides
5298598 we now want to look at small versus large operations and organic versus nonorganic operations to see if there are differences

5298604 the criminals who govern us have injured our earth damaged our republic put us in mortal danger and we go on as if everything were fine seemingly unaware of our dire situation
5298605 my conversations tell me that we are not unaware and that we are seething with repressed rage witnesses to an atrocity we turn away because we feel unable to act
5298606 and our biggest fear is not that any of the million or so terrorists out there will do us any harm but that we will be counted among them
5298607 and so we take off our shoes in the airport and buy newspapers that lie to us and pretend to support the troops and stay away from political gatherings of all kinds

5298654 tim wore his catholicism proudly he talked about it all the time
5298655 in fact russerts faith was not an elephant in the room it was the room it was the room he was raised in it was one of his great charms as was how he dealt with it in life and in our public discourse
5298656 catholicism was his base it was never his bias i think thats absolutely crucial and i will debate anyone who contends to the contrary
5298657 learnings from the political process for common ground in the catholic church
5298658 understood that the stakes were high he knew that better than most of us
5298659 he knew that the civility of our dialogue was under attack he knew that diversity in the public square takes work every day and he knew that our standards of journalism were being attacked
5298660 he understood what it meant to be called to be catholic and i think thats very important he took the call
5298661 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration

5298670 people are different people have different chemistry i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right its not about years its about going out with somebody being truthful on the way in being truthful in the middle and being truthful on the way out

5298679 the fact of the matter is at a certain point when government has not been serving the people for this long people get cynical they tune out
5298680 and they start saying to themselves a plague on both your houses they are willing to consume negative information more frequently than positive information for good reason theyve seen how promises havent been kept
5298681 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obama s varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5298682 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5298683 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent
5298684 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5298685 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5298686 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5298687 it is time for the ncc to get off the fence and take a position in this ongoing debate and investigation of the irregularities in nitel ncc with its capacity in the international telecom industry is in a good position to advise the country especially the bpe on the capabilities and antecedents of those who claim to be telecom experts who have all but ruined nitel
5298688 with regards to the management of nitel by pentascope the bpe on most of the key financial administrative and technical evaluations and decisions claims to have played absolutely no role
5298689 when irregularities are highlighted bpe claims no responsibility most of its responses have either been to claim that it was not aware or that the staff responsible is no longer in their employ and that in most cases it has no documents detailing the activities of either the bureau or its consultants
5298690 these corporations and organisations as well as their former and current employees are reminded that they are still liable and answerable to the national assembly and the nation arrangements have been completed with the appropriate security agencies to ensure that all individuals and documents relevant to this investigation will be made available to the committee
5298691 if they fail to respond the committee will invoke its powers under sections 88 and 89 of the 1999 nigerian constitution to ensure that they comply we are also looking at ways to ensure that companies who failed to pay for the services they utilised will be sanctioned and required to pay triple the fees as restitution in addition to any other civil and criminal penalties
5298692 at the beginning of fiscal year 2003 nitel was a profitable organisation with net profit of over n8 billion yet by the end of the year courtesy of the management of pentascope amp bpe nitel was operating at a loss and has continued to do so with transcorp
5298693 despite this turn in events pentascope went ahead to borrow n40 billion from a consortium of banks that money was spent in less than one year by pentascope with nothing to show for it all this happened under the supervision of bpe
5298694 we have written to all the parties involved and when we begin the hearing a lot more details will emerge our focus is to look at the past events with a view to understanding the environment that allowed this to happen in the first place and ensuring that the right policies and institutions are put in place to ensure that it does not happen again
5298695 bnp par1bas consultant to bpe on two failed attempts at privatisation of nitel plc
5298696 i write to appraise his excellency on the need to exercise caution on the selection of bnp paribas as consultants adviser to the national council on privatisation ncp and the bureau of public enterprises bpe on the proposed core investor selection for nigerian telecommunications limited nitel
5298697 as part of its ongoing investigation into the management and operations of nitel bnp paribas has been identified in the following roles
5298698 we have enough investments and financial engineering to guarantee our prospective investors and back up their financial obligations with any of the nigerian banks
5298699 to ensure that the challenge of area boys touts and other forms of militancy are avoided within the zone we have ensured that we incorporate members of the lekki community in the developmental process of the zone
5298700 so we are open to local investors because we should not be waiting and depending solely on the foreigners for the development of our country and that is why
5298701 we have to encourage our own people in their own small and local ways so that they also can grow to the level of the foreign investors
5298702 all that we want to do is to dangle our carrot for them to come in and invest in the country this we can achieve by making sure that they operate with very minimal or no tax or other forms of duties to facilitate the level of growth of the gross domestic product gdp for the nation
5298703 i agree with him mafiana if his ongoing verification proves so political parties should not only exist just because of government grant even some parties that got up to n700 000 from the last grant cant boast of having befitting party secretariats and party structure

5298715 while i appreciate the service of debbie halvorsons stepson in the armed forces my own military career of six years has allowed me to personally experience the realities of the va
5298716 i will provide all of our veterans with free health care so that they can seek the medical care they need anywhere in the district state or country furthermore while i support the idea of turning silver cross into a va hospital it would be useless if the system continues to be chronically under funded

5299056 i strongly believe that these awards are very good and that they can give us up and coming artists the exposure that we need
5299057 in most competitions photography is always left out as people do not regard it as art and i want to change that view
5299058 i find it hard to relate to young artists because sometimes they do not take their work seriously what i want to do now is to start mentoring older people before they take their talents to the grave
5299059 my dream is to be able to set up studios on my plot in taung where i will be able to offer tutorials to local students and offer them exchange programmes i am not in this for money i want to impart my talent to the younger people
5299060 artists must know that submitting their artworks boosts their profiles even if they do not eventually win because their works will feature in the catalogue that accompanies the awards

5299065 from a sociological perspective we can consider the rol of media in our daily lives the micro level within the context of larger social forces such as the economy politics religion and technological developement the macro level
5299066 should not prompt us to conjure up the dangers of a recession
5299067 it is all the more important to prevent people from anticipating high inflation rates over a longer period of time

5299071 il nostro governo far della lotta alla mafia alla camorra alla ndrangheta uno dei suoi obiettivi principali una grande questione etica di fronte alla quale fa paura il silenzio della politica nazionale
5299072 you add that all up and its not a good year to be running as a republican in wisconsin for president
5299073 its an open question how much the race tightens up and whether wisconsin turns out to be right on the cusp nationally like it has been in previous elections or whether it leans democratic
5299074 for a lot of the states that were very close in the last election given the condition in the country and that sen mccain is wearing the bush mantle whether he likes it or not youre going to see obamas share of the vote go up by 3 4 5 percentage points in those states and theyre not going to be as close as they were
5299075 i realized i had become a sort of a guru about what one needs to do to make a house into a healthy home so i started allergybuyers com to sell helpful products to people like me
5299076 i have always been most interested in the green aspects of what we were doing at allergy buyers and that really goes back a very long way in my history
5299077 forty five years ago i had solar panels on my house in england my family were environmentalists before anybody ever really used the term
5299078 we have products that if people use them can actually make an impact on the world in a positive way its very exciting to conceive of a business where youre making a profit and a difference at the same time
5299079 we still focus on home products but the impact on the greater community is enormous
5299080 its amazing how something so simple can make such a difference and save so much money too
5299081 the kinds of things that ive been living my life around in my home environment suddenly became more interesting to the outside world
5299082 but its like wow its taken everyone 35 years to get it thats like half a lifetime
5299083 they are the biggest marketing ploy that has ever been hoisted on the american public they should be banned

5299086 most of our products if youre a lazy person are a no brainer
5299087 so if youre going to paint a room for 20 you could save a whole lot of money
5299088 weve received a lot of phone calls in the last few days from people asking what this means
5299089 i think there is a lot of interest from the community
5299090 i think denver ought to be passing laws that contribute to building the community instead of tearing it apart when laws are passed that pit the police against the community it can create a dangerous situation
5299091 i expect the city attorneys office to evaluate the next best steps to determine how the ordinance can legally be implemented
5299092 i do speculate however that the new law will be challenged in the courts before its intentions are fully venerated by the public
5299093 i think theres a fairly sizable misconception that if you forgot your license your car will be impounded
5299094 for every law theres a purpose but i dont know if this is a good law

5299100 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5299101 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5299102 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5299103 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5299104 that was an incredible result and a fantastic feeling i hope it will be the first of many podiums in
5299105 there is a great atmosphere in the team and we are all working hard together to move forward which is why it was so satisfying to get on the podium in hungary but valencia is a new race and we must start again
5299106 i did plenty of street races when i was racing in champ cars and in that season almost all the tracks were new to me so i have learnt to adapt quickly it looks like an interesting circuit and its quite long so it should be a good show
5299107 gee sales really suck how can we bring the old glory days back and make people interested in buying bigfoot crap again

5299134 theres plenty of theater made by young people at the fringe most of it receives less attention than it deserves and some of it obviously aims to educate the performers as much as delight
5299135 heres a school show though from the denver school of the arts in colorado that pulls off the rare achievement of bringing 40 young people aged 14 17 on stage showing off some impressive performing skills and offering the audience a truly substantial and moving glimpse into the mind of the generation now trembling on the cusp of adulthood

5299191 weve had a fortunate two years but for all of us who were here the memories of 2004 and 2005 are still fresh
5299192 now is the time for floridians to take the steps necessary to prepare should fays track bring her over our state this week
5299193 we hope that this storm does not turn into a hurricane and if it does that the damage is minimal
5299194 the good news is obviously no state is better prepared or organized to deal with whatever comes this way than the state of florida
5299195 youll be in our thoughts and prayers i am very impressed by what youre doing and what youre prepared to do coming from a state that is not often hit by a hurricane im incredibly impressed
5299196 we have assumed that for the first 72 hours we should rely on no one but ourselves because thats how long it takes for help to come

5299199 we hope that this storm does not turn into a hurricane and if it does that the damage is minimal
5299200 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5299201 but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave
5299202 have to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5299203 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century

5299211 we have to grow the pie the biggest way of quickly growing the pie is in the media area
5299212 the feeling is that we would get greater revenue for media if we had more regular season games
5299213 now youd have to balance that with the need that coaches have to develop and get a team ready to play could it be two preseason games or three i personally wouldnt be adverse to either one
5299214 id have to say that monckton won the debate he came across as more prepared and had answers at his fingertips whereas richard appeared to verbally stumble on occasion
5299215 i got the impression that littlemore was engaging in the debate totally unprepared
5299216 oh my this is very confusing no wonder the government says its too early to take action
5299217 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5299218 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5299219 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5299220 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5299221 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5299222 the democrats talk of tolerance but in reality the only tolerance they ever exhibit is for their own intellectual arrogance and they dont have tolerance for my culture
5299223 they think were a bunch of hillbilly heathens who go out and burn crosses and do crazy bullshit
5299224 they dont give a f if were with them or not because it doesnt matter the f ing republicans have stolen the individual liberties thing and thats why the gun thing is such a big deal
5299225 i got a call from them right after johnny got out i never heard back
5299226 sometimes they remind me of another bunch from chicago the blues brothers they seem to think theyre on a mission from god
5299227 if thats how he runs his campaign he is going to lose id rather bet on those who voted before when he stands up and says that im gonna get 30 per cent more black voters im gonna get 30 per cent more of my people to turn out for me what is joe six pack thinking
5299228 instead of all the high falutin exhortation about listening to the better angels mr obama has gotta come out here and time is short and emphasise social justice
5299229 he should say im a black guy im not gonna take the michael jackson treatment but the problems of south side chicago are the same problems of the appalachian mountains big sonsofabitches are kicking the little sonsofabitches in the ass now im one of the little sonsofabitches so im pissed off inside every rural republican is a rural democrat begging to get out but we always trip over our johnsons
5299230 think this election will be won on the internet but here at 5 30 in the afternoon they dont go on the goddamn internet they go watch the andy griffith show a 1960s sitcom
5299231 white people in the south and throughout the appalachians love black culture i mean southern style cooking is black food everything i eat is fried your swing vote in the appalachians comes down to common sense thinking people who have strong faith and what barack obama needs to do is embrace his culture because we like his culture but nobody knows anything about him over 10 per cent of the rednecks out here and im a redneck think hes a muslim cause nobodys ever told em any different
5299232 im pretty sure i aint a queer and ive never had queer thoughts
5299233 but god loves them queers every bit that he loves the republicans
5299234 its their mouth they can use it to haul coal if they want to
5299235 the gallant kids from around here who lost their lives
5299236 it is the same exact people its the same f ing bunch of fight sing drink pray people who are over there who are over here in these mountains
5299237 youre damn right theyre on hadrians side of the wall is where they are and they want the scots irish vote well its true its f ing genes its who we are as a people well say f you to bush longshanks or maggie thatcher f any of em
5299238 bitterly clinging to their religion guns and antithapy towards others
5299239 im here to advocate for sen obama that we get a democrat into the wh
5299240 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
5299241 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
5299242 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
5299243 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability

5299245 making up your mind questions to consider before the next election
5299246 heres what i want you to do between now and election
5299247 dont just look at issues look at character issues are important but you also have to look at character
5299248 theyre saying im totally self sufficient in myself and nobodys self sufficient enough to be president its too big a job
5299249 rick warren is at the forefront of a kind of younger generation of evangelical protestant leaders who want to have a christian public presence in the culture but who are less tied to the republican politics of their predecessors
5299250 theyre values oriented guys but less convinced that either their own principles or the best politics lies in a total commitment to the republican party
5299251 we are one of those people that make over 250 000 a year and i dont agree that that makes us rich
5299252 even with that kind of income we struggle to pay everything we have gotten ourselves into
5299253 im pretty much a dyed in the wool republican and i was a marine what he went through for five years you gotta hand that to him
5299254 i mean come on whoever buys into that they gotta have a screw loose
5299255 just stay in the senate stay busy learn more foreign policy and come back in ten years obama and i betcha id vote for you
5299256 hes as genuine as can be its just hes a green apple hanging on the tree and mccain is a ripe red apple ready to be picked obama just needs to ripen some more
5299257 barack obama is going to get the same percentage of the religious vote that john kerry and al gore got
5299258 thats christian identity politics and im sure it has some influence but i dont think at the end of the day its the deciding factor
5299259 jimmy carter could have come in here and sounded much more comfortable with his faith but people having seen a jimmy carter presidency would not vote for him just because theyre likely to see him in heaven
5299260 study all the different candidates at every different level you need to register to vote and then you need to vote
5299261 when i hear people say i dont like either of the candidates im just not going to vote i want to say to them well then you need to move to another country because people died for that vote
5299262 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
5299263 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
5299264 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
5299265 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
5299266 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
5299267 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
5299268 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
5299269 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
5299270 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
5299271 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
5299272 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
5299273 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
5299274 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
5299275 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
5299276 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
5299277 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify
5299278 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
5299279 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
5299280 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
5299281 the truth is the truth and thats how the president will testify
5299282 if a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake up
5299283 if this helps anyone out there who is in their middle aged years and has put off what they wanted to do because they thought they were too old or because they have a child and that they cant balance what they want to do with being a parent then thats great what ive done is show them that they can do it
5299284 it was thought that if youre getting to 16 17 or 18 youre getting to the end of your career dara has done a fantastic job in proving that you can continue to improve and that women can have children and get back into the sport she has gotten rid of a mythology in swimming that has been there for so long
5299285 where i ask you to dress me while suggesting with the first part of this title that im naked until you do
5299286 going on a picnic on the lakeshore on a sunday and drinking an entire bottle of prosecco
5299287 oh come on could she have really been that bad
5299288 i have so many horrifying stories to tell over drinks of course drinks so many drinks
5299289 well did she know she was leaving because if she did why did she promise me this by the end of tomorrow i need this by the end of tomorrow because ive already been waiting five months for this
5299290 toss the bums out were starting from scratch were starting over this is not working
5299291 so i understand why a lot of folks are saying this should just happen why are we having to run all these television commercials why do we have to raise all this money
5299292 just read the papers these are the knuckleheads who have been in charge throw em out but american politics arent that simple
5299293 john mccain all he wants to do is talk about me they know they cant win on the issues so what theyll do is theyll try to scare people hes risky hes risky were not sure

5299295 represents an extension of our gocourse platform to address the needs of the 95 of the earths population that falls outside the reach of broadband access
5299296 emerging markets will for the first time enjoy an elearning experience that isnt limited by the unavailability of internet access
5299297 we developed this product to address the needs identified by several local resellers in emerging markets
5299298 while our partners will continue to deploy gocourse under our hosted software as a service saas model gocourse schoolmate provides them with a solution that promises inclusion and equality by extending their services to schools and institutions that dont have broadband access and to learners that were previously too expensive to reach
5299299 i realize it may be a bit startling for people to hear we are taking online learning back offline but that is how we are going to provide a technology bridge for these learning communities
5299300 when broadband access becomes a reality gocourse will be there waiting to help connect these communities to the rest of the world
5299301 the future of open education is taking the online offline

5299316 we appeal for sobriety and ask for ceasefire on both sides they should go back to the negotiating table and extend the people help we are willing to help
5299317 i think this is a wake up call to every one that this is one problem we really have to deal with we should aspire to move forward maybe this should be resolved in a round table discussion instead of letting the guns do the talking so to speak
5299318 maybe we should come up with some compromise because the old framework does not work anymore we should explore and be open to face the changes that might work
5299319 this looks to be like their reaction because iligan city is against bje and the milf is serious in its claims
5299320 what is the price of two sparrows one copper coin but not a single sparrow can fall to the ground without your father knowing it and the very hairs on your head are all numbered so dont be afraid you are more valuable to god than a whole flock of sparrows

5299324 it irritates me when people say that it has all gone wrong
5299325 im very satisfied how weve played this season the problem is expectations have gone too high
5299326 if people look at the fact we are in mid table and reached a cup semi final everyone would have taken that before the start of the season
5299327 what we did is that we played so well up to round 18 and that raised peoples expectations
5299328 in 2lst century multi lingual scotland its not reasonable to expect people to communicate by gestures and guesswork
5299329 many people with limited english believe that the language barrier prevents them getting as good a service as if they were fluent english speakers
5299330 using flash cards and providing a professional interpreting service is an important step in establishing effective communication from the start

5299334 nos estamos jugando el destino de los peque os y medianos productores y tienden a dilatarse las soluciones esta movilizaci n del lunes es una advertencia los tiempos se agotan

5299337 i feel very bad for this result i feel bad for liu xiang and i feel bad for all the people in china
5299338 i believe the chinese people will encourage him to overcome these problems and come back to the track and achieve great performances
5299339 i could not see who was breaking away and after all i normally run my own race and i dont look at other athletes even tomescu knows that i thought i was in the lead and only when we got to the stadium i saw her and was a bit surprised but it was too late to do anything if id seen her earlier definitely i would have pushed
5299340 after i took my spikes off put my shoes on and started to walk to the warm up track it had already hit me
5299341 came over and said i know you didnt quit i know you gave it your all when he said you gave it your best it hurt because i did the tears started coming when you give it your best and you lose it hurts a lot more
5299342 we should have been 3 0 up after half an hour
5299343 i just cant believe it tom bradbrook works his nuts off but hes missed a chance when everyone who saw it said it would have been easier to score
5299344 i dont want to criticise him because i feel sorry for him im a striker and ive been there it happens but then hicham akhazzan missed another chance and we had another one after that
5299345 at 2 0 down we went for it i threw men up front but for 10 15 minutes they overran us really we just lack that little bit of quality and experience
5299346 reporters are grumbling more and more that the campaign is acting like the prom queen they gripe that it is arrogant and control ling and the campaigns own belief that obama is poised to make history isnt endearing either the press certainly helped obama get so far so fast the question is how far can he get if his campaign alienates them
5299347 end of the affair barack obama and the press break up
5299348 the problem is not that democrats are monolithically pro choice or anti school prayer its that by dropping the class language that once distinguished them sharply from republicans they have left themselves vulnerable to cultural wedge issues like guns and abortion and the rest whose hallucinatory appeal would ordinarily be overshadowed by material concerns we are in an environment where republicans talks constantly about class in a coded way to be sure but where democrats are afraid to bring it up
5299349 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
5299350 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons

5299353 supports privatization tax cuts and government spending cuts and opposes laws that limit spending by non party organizations during election campaigns
5299354 in order to attract votes the harper government has combined tax cuts with big spending the effect being to suck the treasury dry
5299355 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
5299356 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
5299357 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
5299358 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
5299359 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
5299360 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
5299361 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
5299362 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5299363 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
5299364 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
5299365 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
5299366 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5299367 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5299368 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5299369 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
5299370 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
5299371 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5299372 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5299373 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5299374 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

5299376 fast and consistent will always beat the slow and steady its good to be slow and steady but its better to be fast and reliable
5299377 first identify your core competency and then change the playing field to suit your core competency
5299378 its good to be individually brilliant and to have strong core competencies but unless youre able to work in a team and harness each others core competencies youll always perform below par because there will always be situations at which youll do poorly and someone else does well teamwork is mainly about situational leadership letting the person with the relevant core competency for a situation take leadership note that neither the hare nor the tortoise gave up after failures the hare decided to work harder and put in more effort after his failure the tortoise changed his strategy because he was already working as hard as he could

5299382 a key statistical procedure on which many past epidemiological studies had relied was flawed
5299383 emissions of smog producing pollutants decreased both nationally and regionally between 1990 and 2000
5299384 both decreased substantially nationally and regionally with statistically significant downward trends nationally no levels in 2005 were about 50 lower than in 1991 and no2 about 30 lower

5299393 the pullback is welcome because many commodities had reached prohibitive levels hindering commerce and really hurting the modest budgets of the poor working poor in developing countries
5299394 however too much of a price slide in commodities would be a sign of a pronounced global economic slowdown which is something we dont want
5299395 in many cases what youve seen is simply institutional investors chasing return on equity first we had strong demand for key commodities which drove prices up then institutional investors entered the market in a major way further driving up prices
5299396 the latter tactic was exaggerated by the use of commodities as surrogates for the sluggish stock market
5299397 thus far it looks like a considerable reduction in inflation in emerging markets countries like china may see drop to the 5 5 6 5 level from the 7 8 5 level for inflation

5299409 this is a fantastic opportunity to throw light on our campaign to bring the olympic torch through dover for the coming games
5299410 the recent spectacular opening of the beijing games really heightened the excitement for londons olympics and the handover day is an excellent way for us in kent to celebrate and enjoy the atmosphere of being the host country
5299411 there really is something for everyone on august 24 and it highlights how the olympics are an opportunity to feel proud of what we have to show the world

5299414 it was very surprising that these subjects would still have cells floating in their blood so long afterward
5299415 the antibodies that we isolated are remarkable antibodies they grab onto the virus very tightly and they virtually never fall off
5299416 that allows them to kill the 1918 virus with extreme potency meaning it takes a very small amount of antibody
5299417 the thought is the first influenza that you see during life is the one that you have the best immunity to
5299418 if we can learn the rules about how these antibodies work we may be able to design antibodies to lots of other viruses
5299419 this study tells us that human beings can make long lasting immune responses to bird influenza
5299420 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5299421 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5299422 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5299423 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5299424 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5299425 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5299426 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5299427 if its a poor choice you spend the next 60 days worrying about the other plane
5299428 every four years you usually get to look at these guys try to go native think of president bush in his brush clearing outfit
5299429 but if youre president the day job does involve a suit and it can be awkward when youre not in work clothes
5299430 everyone knows how fast a picture can go from local novelty to worldwide laughingstock
5299431 it shows hes not trying to be like everyone else its part of the visual message that hes crafting in an odd little way it adds to the not pandering in a conservative middle america suit like a 50 year old tax lawyer wears
5299432 it would be inappropriate if mccain looked as stylish as obama he has a different physique hes a different age and hes much more conservative
5299433 he does have occasional fun with a wider flashy tie
5299434 not all senators can wear that but it looks right on him
5299435 you could put baracks head on johns body and say hes gained a little weight but you wouldnt notice he was in different clothes
5299436 they were always like oh my god you ate a muffin
5299437 shes the first trainer whos said youre not eating enough
5299438 i have seen the collapse of government after government and they all think they can last a thousand years each new one always declares the last one criminal and corrupt and always promises a future of justice and freedom

5299464 i dont want this sport to be an every four year sport
5299465 i think yeah we get the most attention every four years but in between those four years theres really not as much exposure for us as i would like i just want more people to get involved in the sport i really think its going to happen i think over the next four years its going to happen more and more
5299466 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
5299467 when i lose a race like that it motivates me even more to try to swim faster
5299468 ellen degeneres and portia de rossi were married tonight in an intimate ceremony at their home in los angeles

5299471 you can always get better theres not a lot of perfect games out there so if you think youve arrived youre going to be embarrassed pretty quickly
5299472 but i was pleased with the way he played today against an excellent defense

5299474 conclude the negotiations as a matter of urgency to restore political stability in zimbabwe
5299475 to sign any outstanding agreements as a matter of urgency to restore political stability in zimbabwe
5299476 the political conditions must be created so that this humanitarian socio economic situation in zimbabwe is addressed as a matter of urgency by an inclusive government
5299477 it is critical that we conclude negotiations as a matter of urgency because people are suffering
5299478 we have now spoken to several witnesses and built up a good description of the suspect
5299479 i would urge local people to read it carefully and think about anyone they know who fits the description given that the suspect returned approximately 30 minutes after the exchange of words at the traffic lights it is highly likely he lives locally
5299480 the taxi driver has not come forward yet and it is vitally important we hear from him

5299494 we said gee we might be good at this lets try and build a program
5299495 i just wanted to try it out and i stuck with it
5299496 a lot of times people think female wrestlers are butch or big and scary but thats not true at all
5299497 id be lying if i said we didnt get a few raised eyebrows
5299498 little suzie comes home and says i want to wrestle and the first thing you think of is chyna from the wwf
5299499 sure when theyre in the competitive arena theyre tough and aggressive but away from that theyre very much feminine
5299500 with the women performing so well i would expect well get a bump in interest on the womens side in particular
5299501 some were adamantly opposed to it for various reasons like that it was a mens sport
5299502 one guy said to me who wants to see big fat girls rolling around on a mat
5299503 i kept telling them when some girls ripping your head off you dont feel particularly sexy at that moment
5299504 it was just difficult getting over those old habits and old ideas eventually it started growing so fast that those who were reluctant simply got left behind
5299505 we love the american people its the policies of your government we dont like
5299506 the prophets endure and can only be ignored at the risk of our own despair
5299507 i think we started very well up top and in the defense
5299508 and then we made some individual mistakes and they got the goals
5299509 its very hard to stop marta and cristiane with two or three players
5299510 i dont think it was a breakdown of our defense
5299511 we were running into fast breaks and they brazil did pretty well we could have conceded even more goals five or six but we could have scored on the other side as well
5299512 i think we started very well up top and in the defense
5299513 and then we made some individual mistakes and they got the goals
5299514 its very hard to stop marta and cristiane with two or three players
5299515 i dont think it was a breakdown of our defense
5299516 we were running into fast breaks and they brazil did pretty well we could have conceded even more goals five or six but we could have scored on the other side as well
5299517 its not that we are going to play every tournament with no goals against us
5299518 we have to make sure we take advantage of our one or two chances when they happen
5299519 we will not have many and we must be aggressive on defense
5299520 i have to be careful not to let the first batters reach base
5299521 the u s team is very powerful they will make the hits but i must try to make sure they are not big ones
5299522 the cover stars ll cool j queen latifah ice cube and nas they have a history of longevity and of always changing the game and i think that spike lee captured that
5299523 on set he was actually very much involved paying attention to what the artists were doing asking them if they were comfortable asking them about their music and what they were working on
5299524 everyone was moved in the office people who had been here for quite some time even said it was the first time they felt such a great feeling it was so inspiring to them
5299525 but moving forward were looking to appeal to a multi generational hip hop community that is international
5299526 its not going to be an easy task but were so willing and so confident in the source brand
5299527 success in business is the civil rights imperative of the new millennium
5299528 i owe my hip hop life right this second to the internet
5299529 well cause im crazy number one and thats the place for crazy people
5299530 i really wanted to go somewhere differently creatively and musically somewhere i havent been going with mood muzik and my debut album i just wanted to explore and try some different sh t
5299531 me and him have agreed to disagree on certain things
5299532 were in the early stages like choosing a dj is one of the furthest things from my mind we still in to the recording process ive already started it and then i kinda just stopped to do some other things like i finished padded room
5299533 ive been online prior to my debut album dropping imma say as far back as 2000
5299534 i think its actually helped me to this day i used to always express to the label how important that new media presence was they just saw things a lil differently but me i was always intrigued by it amazed by it it kept me well informed better informed than people in the streets and at the labels actually i would never abandon the internet ever i owe my hip hop life right this second to the internet
5299535 if i have learned anything from the music business it is that timelines are pieces of sh t and thats regarding anything
5299536 because at the drop of a dime blink of an eye anything can change
5299537 the diss records i dont really listen to them i do em to respond or to express my point of view and i leave it alone
5299538 sometimes i will go back and put on a g unit diss big shot or ransom note and ill be like holy sh t that was all right
5299539 but you put on quite a show really had me goin but now its time to go curtains finally closin that was quite a show very entertainin but its over now but its over now go on and take a bow

5299543 this complex and sensitive inquiry has been part of the largest investigation of its kind within the uk the success of the operation is very much down to the excellent working relationship between cleveland police ceop centre met police and cleveland crown prosecution service cps
5299544 he thompson was a senior administrator for a paedophile website todays sentence reflects how seriously the criminal justice system views those who take gratification from the sexual abuse of children
5299545 id like to make it clear that these websites cannot be stumbled across by their very nature they are hidden and people are directed to them but what i want to re iterate is that people who visit these sites leave a trail and we will follow that trail and find them
5299546 the evidence showed that philip thomson had in his possession one of the largest collections of images of child abuse in the uk
5299547 i provided pre charge advice to cleveland police and decided that philip thompson should not face just one or two specimen charges relating to the images but a total of 27 charges to reflect the criminality of his behaviour and to give the court adequate sentencing powers
5299548 thompson was a critical piece of this jigsaw network he was the librarian warehouseman for a myriad of images that were distributed to like minded individuals both in this country and elsewhere
5299549 i hope this result acts as a deterrent and sends out a clear warning that activity such as this will not be tolerated
5299550 in all things it is better to hope than to despair
5299551 plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you hope and a future

5299560 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5299561 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5299562 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration

5299583 what is a good holiday as a birthday present for my 16 year old daughter
5299584 what is a good holiday as a birthday present for my 16 year old daughter
5299585 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5299586 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5299587 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5299588 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5299589 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5299590 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5299591 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5299592 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5299593 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5299594 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5299595 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5299596 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5299597 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5299598 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5299599 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5299600 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5299601 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5299602 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5299603 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5299604 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5299605 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5299606 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5299607 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5299608 anyone who has spent an hour or a day listening to demos understands the labels place in the food chain
5299609 when google turned advertising into a software application a classic services business formerly based on human economics things get more expensive each year switched to software economics things get cheaper

5299611 when google turned advertising into a software application a classic services business formerly based on human economics things get more expensive each year switched to software economics things get cheaper
5299612 the album is more or less all in the bag except for a few minor details
5299613 but the word coming out is that the band is very very happy with the end product and when u2 are happy it should be quite a piece of work theyre not easy to please
5299614 its nice if we open the package when everybody gather this weekend
5299615 it is difficult to stand on the board at the first experience and todays sea has slightly big wave so dont worry even if you cannot do it

5299620 aqu estamos en un proceso de transferencia tecnol gica gracias a la generosidad de china
5299621 para todos los usuarios de los servicios de televisi n contar con este sat lite ser un salto muy importante
5299622 igualmente telesur que es nuestra se al internacional va a poder potenciar su alcance y vamos a poder tener m s control de la distribuci n de su se al con este servicio
5299623 lo primero que har es buscar el sol y girar hacia l para expandir los paneles solares de 12 1 metros de largo en cada lado y 3 metros de ancho luego buscar la tierra
5299624 tampoco entiendo muy bien por qu ahora queremos reescribir la constituci n
5299625 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5299626 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5299627 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5299628 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5299629 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5299630 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5299631 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5299632 this is a planning took where all things are going
5299633 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5299634 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5299635 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5299636 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5299637 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5299638 how low can the illusory price of gold go while there are serious supply bottlenecks that are popping up all over the place
5299639 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5299640 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5299641 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5299642 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5299643 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5299644 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5299645 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5299646 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5299647 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5299648 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5299649 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5299650 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones

5299652 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5299653 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5299654 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5299655 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5299656 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5299657 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5299658 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5299659 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5299660 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5299661 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5299662 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5299663 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills

5299668 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5299669 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5299670 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5299671 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5299672 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5299673 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5299674 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5299675 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5299676 what we cannot win by peace we will wrest through war
5299677 3 1 2 aggressive action such as attacks raids ambuscades landmining and offensive military actions such as shelling reconnoitering and unjustified massing of troops
5299678 3 2 1 display of milf flag in non identified milf areas
5299679 3 2 2 providing sanctuary or assistance to criminal or lawless elements
5299680 3 2 3 massive deployment and or movement of grp and milf forces which are not normal administrative functions and activities
5299681 3 2 4 public pronouncements that will tend to undermine the sincerity or credibility of either party in implementing the cessation of hostilities

5299685 whom you meet how you meet them and what they think of you afterward should not be left to chance as winston churchill would tell us preparation is if not the key to genius then at least the key to sounding like a genius before i meet with any new people ive been thinking of introducing myself to i research who they are and what their business is i find out whats important to them their hobbies challenges goals inside their business and out before the meeting i generally prepare or have my assistant prepare a one page synopsis on the person im about to meet the only criterion for what should be included is that i want to know what this person is like as a human being what he or she feels strongly about and what his or her proudest achievements are sure you want to be up to date on whats happening within the company of a person you want to establish a relationship with did the person have a good or bad quarter do they have a new product trust me all people naturally care generally above and beyond anything else about what it is they do if you are informed enough to step comfortably into their world and talk knowledgeably their appreciation will be tangible as william james wrote the deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated
5299686 preparation is if not the key to genius then at least the key to sounding like a genius

5299697 not only a requirement of law it is a requirement of justice to the victims and of deterrence to powerful countries such as those in nato who in their military might and in their control over the media are lacking in any other natural restraint such as might deter less powerful countries
5299698 by holding individuals accountable regardless of their position the ictys work has dismantled the tradition of impunity for war crimes and other serious violations of international law particularly by individuals who held the most senior positions

5299946 our data for characterization rating charts provide growers with better indications of product performance for agronomic and disease traits relevant to their situation
5299947 we expose hybrids and varieties to many environmental disease and pest challenges and then evaluate how well that seed performs
5299948 managed environments are selected for specific traits to magnify differences between seed products to get the best score in extreme conditions
5299949 once trait data are collected and analyzed they are classified using a proprietary system for trait scoring a score is not assigned until there are relevant comparisons with widely grown benchmark hybrids
5299950 we continually work to refine our scoring methodologies to provide the most reliable accurate information
5299951 knowing the key characteristics of our products how well a product performs given the growing conditions and environment offers a grower the ability to choose the best hybrid or variety for each field
5299952 for example if a grower knows an area on the farm has a higher chance of brittle snap gray leaf spot or other conditions a hybrid that matches those concerns can be selected
5299953 growers need to understand their fields and environments and make a choice by prioritizing the highest areas of concerns choosing a variety or hybrid that offers the highest probability of success
5299954 every seed company offers growers trait scores but growers cannot take one companys scores and compare the scores to another company
5299955 along with selecting hybrids and varieties for agronomic scoring traits pioneer characterization charts also offer scores for special use growers will find ratings for livestock producers and ethanol processors with scores including silage tonnage fiber digestibility extractable starch content total fermentables and other relevant scores for specific end use
5299956 pioneer suggests growers consult with their sales professional and review what qualities are important to each field and make a choice based on that information
5299957 each year always brings new challenges to growers this year we have seen a very diverse growing season we suggest growers continue to make sound decisions based on their individual fields and product performance goals for the upcoming season
5299958 consistency on the front end though multiple testing and evaluation makes the data we use to determine trait scores more reliable and pioneer has the most reliable scoring systems on the market today
