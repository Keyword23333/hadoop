8310072 il tempo passa anche quando sembra impossibile anche qundo il rintocco di ogni secondo fa male come il sangue che pulsa nelle ferite passa in maniera disuguale tra strani scatti e bonacce prolungate ma passa

8310101 as a black person im like youre telling me this is my music
8310102 hey this isnt for stuffy guys who write with a quill
8310103 but we do like to keep things moving as it were
8310104 after muz everyone else in burlesque must go back to the dressing room and suck cock for tips sorry
8310105 deconstruct the humor and paradigms of country and heavy metal music while playing matching guitars and barely sitting on one anothers shoulders
8310106 modern with a bit of saturday morning cartoons mixed in
8310107 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8310108 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8310109 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8310110 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
8310111 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8310112 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8310113 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8310114 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8310115 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8310116 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8310117 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8310118 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8310119 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8310120 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8310121 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8310122 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8310123 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8310124 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8310125 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8310126 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8310127 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8310128 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8310129 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8310130 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8310131 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8310132 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8310133 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8310134 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8310135 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8310136 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8310137 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8310138 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8310139 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8310140 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8310141 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8310142 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8310143 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8310144 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8310145 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8310146 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8310147 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8310148 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8310149 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8310150 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8310151 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8310152 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8310153 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8310154 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8310155 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8310156 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8310157 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

8310159 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8310160 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8310161 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8310162 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8310163 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8310164 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8310165 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8310166 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8310167 no one works for someone we all just work together
8310168 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8310169 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8310170 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses

8310174 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8310175 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8310176 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8310177 andrew what do you want to be when you grow up
8310178 this week man i would like to be a truly great blogger
8310179 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8310180 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8310181 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8310182 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8310183 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8310184 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8310185 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8310186 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8310187 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8310188 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8310189 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8310190 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8310191 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8310192 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8310193 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8310194 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8310195 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8310196 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8310197 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8310198 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8310199 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8310200 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8310201 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8310202 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8310203 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8310204 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8310205 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8310206 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8310207 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8310208 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8310209 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8310210 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8310211 wszystko si stopniowo u o y i stosunki powr c do stanu sprzed konfliktu rosyjsko gruzi skiego
8310212 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8310213 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8310214 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8310215 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8310216 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8310217 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8310218 the l word is not thrown around by men as easily as it is by women but i didnt say it first hes very loving were very open and vocal
8310219 were doing different things and the guy runs forever like i swear hes running 11 miles a day i cant run thats the one thing i cant do because i feel like the further i jog away from my house the further i have to jog back

8310377 cette d cision va lencontre de plusieurs r solutions du conseil de s curit de lonu vot es plus t t par la russie et ne correspond pas laccord de cessez le feu sign par le pr sident medvedev le 12 ao t dernier
8310378 nous esp rons que la russie remplira ses engagements internationaux r visera cette d cision irresponsable et respectera les six principes de r glement du conflit en g orgie
8310379 lint grit territoriale et les fronti res de la g orgie doivent tre respect es aussi bien que celles de la russie ou dun autre pays
8310380 cette d marche de moscou renforce la tension et entrave les n gociations diplomatiques
8310381 conform ment aux r solutions de lonu qui sont toujours en vigueur labkhazie et loss tie du sud font partie de la g orgie et doivent y rester
8310382 nous sommes interd pendants et cest pourquoi nous souhaitons que nos partenaires am ricains soccupent moins daffaires internationales et plus du renforcement de leur conomie parce que l conomie am ricaine est au coeur de tr s nombreux probl mes conomiques
8310383 la russie a besoin de bonnes relations avec loccident comme loccident a besoin de bonnes relations avec la russie l conomie est mondiale ce qui se passe la bourse de new york a des r percussions le lendemain tokyo puis moscou
8310384 ce serait une situation fort d sagr able pour les etats unis et dautres march s ces choses l il faut sen occuper y compris par des efforts conjoints
8310385 est hors la loi internationale et ce nest pas seulement lopinion de lunion europ enne
8310386 nous ne pouvons pas accepter ces violations de tout le droit international des accords de s curit et de coop ration en europe des r solutions des nations unies et la prise pour la premi re fois depuis longtemps dun territoire par une arm e dun pays voisin
8310387 nous sommes en train de former une coalition afin de r sister la russie par des moyens diplomatiques il ne sagit pas de coalition militaire par la voie diplomatique nous mettrons fin loccupation du territoire g orgien par les russes
8310388 pour ce qui concerne le bouclier antimissile le d ploiement de missiles en pologne et dun radar en r publique tch que cela nest quun pas de plus vers lattisement des tensions nous ne pouvons pas consid rer cette d marche autrement que comme dirig e contre la russie quels que soient les motifs voqu s en loccurrence par les pays de lotan
8310389 on nous raconte que certains pays repr sentent une menace cest du blabla a t il poursuivi ces missiles une fois install s proximit de nos fronti res nous menaceront cest certain cela ne manquera pas daggraver les tensions et nous serons amen s r agir naturellement par des moyens militaires
8310390 je pense que lotan le comprend parfaitement cest le choix de lalliance atlantique ce nest pas nous qui installons des missiles

8310452 most accounts agree that it was south ossetian separatists who committed the first act of escalation when they blew up a georgian military vehicle on august 1 wounding five georgian peacekeeping troops georgia responded in kind killing six south ossetian militiamen
8310453 capt ivanov and eduard kokoity the pro moscow president of south ossetia say they held a meeting that day between marat kulakhmetov commander of the russian peacekeeping forces and temur yakobashvili the georgian minister for re integration whose job is to deal with the breakaway regions
8310454 i would like to address those who are now shooting at georgian policemen i want to say with full responsibility that several hours ago i reached a very difficult decision not to respond with fire this was no use however and the fighting escalated
8310455 georgian president sakashvilis biggest lie was his attempt to airbrush the fact that he created the crisis by launching an artillery barrage on the south ossetian capital which killed scores of civilians and 15 russian peacekeepers it was absurd to think russia would not retaliate so the next lie was to claim russias leaders had prepared a trap in fact they were taken by surprise as much as the ossetians nevertheless russia should pull back completely now it should also have restrained south ossetian militias from running amok against georgian villages

8310461 yet there were indications that no 10 had more room for manoeuvre than it realised in july 2005 the ira had finally agreed to decommission all its weapons at the last minute adams called no 10 to demand that some of the weapons not be destroyed so that the ira could arm itself against possible attacks from dissident members unless this was allowed he threatened decommissioning would not proceed the blair government conceded but wanted to check with dublin irish justice minister michael mcdowell refused to acquiesce in the backsliding despite enormous pressure powell told adams of the problem and adams gave way decommissioning took place as planned

8310464 trends differ for the four countries of the uk the population of england is projected to increase by 8 per cent by 2016 that of northern ireland by 7 per cent big year that and wales by 5 per cent the projected increase for scotland where fertility and life expectancy levels are assumed to remain lower than in the rest of the uk is 3 per cent across the united kingdom northern ireland recorded the highest rate of growth with a one per cent population rise last year to 1 8 million people the population of england rose by 0 6 per cent to 51 1 million scotland and wales rose by 0 5 per cent

8310470 discussions on the devolution of policing and justice have progressed well in the preparation for government committee the governments have requested the parties to continue these discussions so as to agree the necessary administrative arrangements to create a new policing and justice department it is our view i e the view of the two governments that the implementation of the agreement published today should be sufficient to build the community confidence necessary for the assembly to request the devolution of criminal justice and policing from the british government by may 2008
8310471 there is no definitive date for the devolution of policing and justice powers we remain of the unshakable view that those powers can only be transferred whenever there is the required community confidence

8310474 this charge of fiddling while rome burns was a problem which heaney discusses in his essay the interesting case of nero chekhovs cognac and a knocker where he recalls how he and david hammond felt unable to record a tape of songs against the immediate backdrop of explosions in belfast
8310475 we aimed to challenge sectarian divisions in the north of ireland to put
8310476 davy is in that well worn phrase a man of many parts but the whole is greater than the sum of the parts and the uniqueness of david hammond is his midas touch the way he can discern art and poetry in the commonplace and above all the way in which he effortlessly explores i would almost say creates a common ground on which irishmen and women of every tradition and disposition no matter how cantankerous or self regarding we may be in other areas can meet each other and re discover a vital part of ourselves in all of this his wife eileen has played a quiet but essential part their home in belfast has for years been a magnet for cultural waifs and strays of every description an embassy of song its warmth and hospitality a standing rebuke to the image of the dour wee north that is most prevalent among people who have never crossed the border
8310477 the singers house by seamus heaney to david hammond people here used to believe that drowned souls lived in seals at spring tides they might change shape they loved music and swam in for a singer who might stand at the end of summer in the mouth of a whitewashed turf shed his shoulder to the jamb his song a rowboat far out in evening when i came here first you were always singing a hint of the clip of the pick in your winnowing climb and attack raise it again man we still believe what we hear

8310482 concerns were expressed regarding abortion despite the specific assurances in terms of irelands legal arrangements in this regard
8310483 the overwhelming feeling expressed in more than 90 messages posted about the topic was that finding a northern ireland anthem could benefit the team
8310484 i heard poots spouting some rubbish about how northern ireland fans wouldnt stand for a change how dare he speak for all fans why not ask them first
8310485 for those who think it will diminish their britishness watch how hard sinn fein fight against this and ask yourselves why
8310486 mr poots is more and more increasingly out of touch with grassroots unionism i resent the fact that he would label anyone that disagrees with him as a lesser unionist
8310487 me being proud of being northern irish and wanting us to use a northern irish anthem doesnt make me any less british than you or devalue my unionism and not all northern ireland fans are unionists anyway you fool
8310488 poots reaction was totally predictable its just a stupid im more british than you points scoring exercise

8310490 good on you basil dup sinn fein axis not in favour what a surprise
8310491 this would be a very positive step in my eyes the one and only chant i hate hearing at windsor is the old no surrender as it offends many of our own players i am pro union but that is neither here nor there and has nothing to do with supporting all 11 players wearing our green shirt
8310492 as he is not a politician going to the us on peace processing business
8310493 the refusal is based upon his felony conviction as he is not a politician going to the us on peace processing business he does not get a waiver to entry despite his conviction as other convicted ira members have
8310494 he could apply again but the likelihood of his being able to enter the states is slim to none given both his record and the political climate
8310495 there is a famous story from seoul in 1988 that there were so many used condoms on the roof terrace of the british teams residential block the night after the swimming concluded that the british olympic association sent out an edict banning outdoor sex here in beijing organisers have realised that such prohibitions are about as useful as banning breathing and have instead handed out thousands of free condoms to the athletes if you cant stop em at least make it safe

8310501 there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis
8310502 if martin mcguinness does not distance himself from this statement then a full blown crisis is facing the executive next month
8310503 i think there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis policing and justice devolution can only occur if there is sufficient public confidence in the ability of politicians to handle such a sensitive matter i think the question is this will these remarks by sinn fein convince anyone out there that this is mature politics when people are threatening to pull the whole thing down
8310504 bearing in mind the statement went through their official press office one is left with the impression its a bit of kite flying by sinn f in these comments were not off the cuff or out of the blue
8310505 comments such as these are clearly part of the pathetic choreography surrounding the so called policing and justice saga members of mr caol ins own party are disenchanted not only by the failure of their leaders to secure the devolution of such powers to stormont but also by their cosy relationship with the dup

8310524 down the road we will be looking at what may be required to rebuild the georgian military
8310525 the danger is letting the russians think they can get away with this and do it again in ukraine or someplace else they have to realize that theyre not going to get a free ride
8310526 its physically impossible for us to do enough to deter the russians from further incursions so its not clear to me that would be appreciably more than symbolic
8310527 its hard to imagine that the united states would embark on the process of rearming georgia until the conflict has reached a stable equilibrium that at least has the possibility of triggering some kind of military confrontation between the u s and

8310550 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally
8310551 we used to design products for global requirements and distribute the same product globally
8310552 in this situation we started with talking to emerging country customers designing a product for emerging countries and our initial launch of the product is only in emerging countries thats a big departure in our strategy
8310553 the pricing challenges many oems experienced is a concern as it may foreshadow a slowdown in market demand as enterprise budgets face further scrutiny in the second half of 2008
8310554 we national fatwa council feel that after the legal process has taken place any of the parties who feels he had been violated or victimised could resort to muhabalah involving both parties
8310555 islamic law is fair so the people should not worry whether the case should be resolved through the legal process in court or outside court through sumpah mubahalah which should involve both parties but not necessarily at the same place
8310556 go through the legal process first anyway it there are too many of such swearing it would lose its value and people will no longer believe in it

8310559 the new nokia 888 can change shapes on the fly
8310560 he will fly out straight after the game against newcastle tomorrow
8310561 they have back to back games and hell fly out straight after the wednesday game
8310562 that makes it a bit difficult for him for the adelaide game but all we can do is see how he pulls up
8310563 he didnt play so much in the olympics the archie i saw in china was not as good as the archie i saw in the a league its time for him to pick up again
8310564 learn as much as you can because even if you lose your possessions no one can take your knowledge
8310565 we miss this week because we dont get a run then cop the same situation in the makybe diva because so many horses who missed out will want to run there as well
8310566 the memsie is a crucial spring race for so many spring horses yet theyve got the rail out 11m and only 13 runners they dont race again at caulfield for at least the next two saturdays what are they protecting it for
8310567 that will put us behind the eight ball for the whole spring
8310568 you dont expect either to occur at this time of year
8310569 theres a lot of improvement to come how far can he go
8310570 last year it was proven a horse can get to the caulfield guineas on the back of a handful of starts im not saying hes weekend hussler but at least he showed it could be done on the back of a handful of starts
8310571 i think forgetting his price tag it was a good effort to go to town and win first up particularly in a rating 82 race and there were some nice horses in that race
8310572 i like the way he put himself into the race were behind time for the good races but at least were off to a good start
8310573 he will run in a race here in three weeks time before i put him into a stakes race
8310574 ive always known he was a good horse i thought he was one of my best two year olds then three year olds but he kept going shin sore
8310575 we just had to wait for him to come good
8310576 i stay at 165 pounds and cook everything out of cooking light magazine i only eat irresponsibly on saturdays which means bacon and candy
8310577 i am against it if you have bad plastic surgery it looks like you were brought up poor moved to la and didnt make it if its good you just look like somebody else

8310586 it has come as a complete surprise its an amazing story im very emotional about it
8310587 we are a big supporter of the nrl and have been a part of the nrl for some time
8310588 we talk to our staff and clients about respect and integrity and we cant afford to have anything tarnish that
8310589 our brand and image are everything quality and respect its hard to keep talking to staff and clients about this if we dont stand by it im having trouble keeping this on track
8310590 this has created a real problem for us this isnt particularly healthy
8310591 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8310592 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8310593 shes going to work for barack obama and shes very serious about it
8310594 i think she can help and hopefully this brings us some unity
8310595 i think she has made peace with it her supporters need to too it really is a problem
8310596 that was excellent that was a strong speech she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election
8310597 i think she delivered a very good speech her supporters need to hear that
8310598 senator clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief
8310599 nowhere tonight did she say that barack obama is ready to lead
8310600 millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8310601 i think youll have a great sense today where he stands
8310602 do whatever senator obama and senator joe biden his vice presidential running mate need them to do
8310603 i would predict that by the end of this week you will see a very positive and clear agenda for change
8310604 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare

8310618 this year is a very challenging in north america for the robotics industry and other capital equipment industries
8310619 the gains in sales to non automotive companies are very encouraging in the long term
8310620 were seeing strong growth this year from orders in the ic electronics and photonics industries up 117 percent metals up 74 percent plastics and rubber up 71 percent among others
8310621 this is attributed to cuts in shipment by key large customers from the communication marvell qualcomm texas instruments graphics and consumer sectors
8310622 additionally we believe that forecasts for q4 wafer shipments have recently been cut with customers from the consumer end markets particularly game console digital imaging stb dvd fpd and communications bluetooth having the largest cutbacks
8310623 thus we now expect q4 wafer shipment to decline by as much as 8 percent to 10 percent quarter over quarter below previous expectations of down 4 percent to 5 percent quarter over quarter
8310624 our current read on q1 09 wafer shipments suggests below seasonal shipment decline of 5 percent to 10 percent quarter over quarter though we note that it is too early to make an accurate assessment of the q1 09 demand environment
8310625 recent industry checks indicate to us that wafer shipments into solar customers improved from june to july and that volume shipments in the first three weeks of august have already exceeded total shipments in july
8310626 however we also note that there has been incremental weakness in demand from the semiconductor industry over the past six weeks particularly from foundries
8310627 marvell has been cutting wafer shipments at both tsmc and smic
8310628 for marvell we think fears of wafer cuts at foundries in q3 is a head fake and that prudent investors should realize that q3 wafer production growth remains ahead of street consensus revenue growth estimates
8310629 we do believe that embedded in some of these cuts is an element of de booking reserved capacity that was booked in order to guard against any possible supply shortages in q4
8310630 with supply now readily available there is no need to reserve capacity with the largest foundry customer apart from that we do see production shifting over to smic with q3 wafer shipments set to grow about 15 percent sequentially more production at smic also has positive gross margin implications given that its wafer pricing is 10 20 percent lower than tsmcs wafer pricing
8310631 for fy q2 recent checks suggest marvells q2 revenues and eps tracked ahead of street estimates on strength in wi fi and possibly storage
8310632 inventory for intel processors was up slightly while amds was down a bit at north american distribution over the past week with most of europe still on vacation we heard that there is not much market activity for semi components
8310633 on the other hand conversations with our contacts suggest that demand for components going into china is starting to pick up again now that the olympics are over
8310634 with the chinese government putting limits on traffic into the country in august we are likely to see some companies reporting lumpier than usual monthly numbers for q3 this is because some orders were pulled ahead into july while the rest was pushed out to september
8310635 we are very pleased to have started the volume production of our xdr product for ps3 this is an achievement reflecting our product diversification strategy and demonstrating our expertise in the memory market
8310636 we are preparing to accommodate all our customers using xdr dram in various applications
8310637 qimondas commitment to the intensified xdr memory architecture is extended to the consumer and computing applications
8310638 we look forward to our partnership with qimonda on other memory solutions among high volume applications seeking breakthrough performance
8310639 electrification will happen in the next few years and it will change the semiconductor landscape
8310640 anything that aims at reducing co 2 is beneficial for the electronics industry
8310641 the semiconductor content of these vehicles is significantly higher than in conventionally driven cars
8310642 with a power demand of several kilowatts this compressor is normally driven directly by the cars engine by means of a belt transmission now it can be connected to the high voltage circuit which leads to increased efficiency
8310643 the two drives need to switch over seamlessly this is where oems and tier ones can create the added value for their respective brand
8310644 we are focusing more on the charge management and see a huge potential in the analog mixed signal parts used in the dc dc and ac dc converters
8310645 we know that suboptimal speed behavior leads to increased fuel consumption
8310646 if this factor is considered in the program of the acc it can optimize the fuel efficiency
8310647 canmore intels new x86 based chip is pretty much better and the next one could be hard to beat
8310648 why should we believe that canmore is better than others to solve the fundamental internet tv problems the consumer electronics industry couldnt figure out for years is it because canmore is x86 based or is it because of this widget channel thing
8310649 one of the major problems with internet tv is that it interrupted peoples tv watching experience by trying to place browsers on tv and to have viewers use keyboards or complex remotes to interact with it
8310650 systems makers need to drive three changes if they want to accelerate the coming of the internet tv revolution by breaking down the walled gardens of content remove the clutter of adapter boxes and lay down some web video software standards
8310651 this addition will be the backbone of the new expanded epilepsy surgery program offering new treatment options to the most complex epileptic patients with medically intractable seizures
8310652 there is no ban on shipment of sirfs or our customers products
8310653 in fact the itc will not even make any final determination until december after they have finished their investigation including reviewing the itc staffs appeal and our appeal

8310656 we are delighted intel capital has led this round of funding which will give us further momentum in the growing wan optimization market
8310657 market maturity combined with the changing economic climate has transformed wan optimization from being nice to have to a business necessity representing a great market opportunity for expand to attack
8310658 the rise of the distributed enterprise has led to an increase in branch offices and the exponential growth of remote and mobile workers demanding access to centralized corporate resources this places pressure on wan infrastructures to overcome disruptive latency issues in order to support an enterprises mobile computing strategy our investment in expand networks will help them tackle these pressure issues and address a fast growing market opportunity

8310665 the bi market while consolidating is far from being mature contrary to popular belief this vibrant market continues to evolve across multiple dimensions
8310666 we are currently on the cusp of a next generation bi with different user interfaces integration with process and rules end user self service alternative analytical dbms technologies and many others
8310667 contrary to some market consolidation trends respectable and rich bi alternatives abound ibi shines with continued innovation comparable to much larger bi vendors and the most comprehensive information access adapters easily connecting a large number of very heterogeneous data sources including legacy mainframe databases
8310668 similar to much larger vendors information builders is getting as close as possible to crossing every
8310669 while microsofts bi offering was mostly the realm of smaller enterprises and very microsoft centric environments in the past that is all changing
8310670 the bottom line is that most enterprises whether they know it or not have sql server somewhere in their organisation and therefore already own a large portion of microsoft bi tools which includes one of the most widely used olap engine with a highly useful rolap molap real time tuning feature microsoft bi really di erentiates itself where many other bi vendors fail the entire bi development environment is tightly integrated with microsoft visual studio a popular integrated development environment ide
8310671 while microsoft continues to round out its bi portfolio today it still relies heavily on partners to deliver complete end to end bi solutions which include data quality and text analytics products from partners
8310672 unlike many other bi vendors that rely mainly on the power of the underlying dbms microstrategy offers its own very powerful rolap engine which can virtually optimise even poorly architected data models
8310673 it is not microstrategys strategy to address bi components other than enterprise reporting and analytics and the company will continue to rely heavily on partners to deliver complete end to end bi solutions as a result microstrategy buyers often need to assemble components from other vendors
8310674 sap business objects believes that enterprises need the best bi tool for every use case sometimes even at the expense of less than complete integration
8310675 the company went on a spree of acquiring and building many different bi tools over the past few years and ended up with one of the richest bi portfolios on the market in its xi release ibm cognos believed that a unified integrated platform is preferable to a composite of best of breed offerings even if it did not address every single bi function and feature end users wanted rather than acquiring multiple technologies ibm cognos completely rebuilt its architecture in release 8 falling a bit behind sap business objects in functionality but leading in modern uni ed architecture
8310676 the bi market while consolidating is far from being mature contrary to popular belief this vibrant market continues to evolve across multiple dimensions
8310677 top priorities include bringing all sap business objects products into a common platform for improved security and administration integrating the multiple products enabling easier interchange of all metadata and migrating from one product to another all of which could require a signi cant rewrite effort
8310678 even though ibm cognos may not have as many bells and whistles as its top competitor sap business objects product integration is much less of an issue
8310679 forrester expects oracle to continue to acquire companies in the areas where it still heavily relies on partners such as data quality
8310680 oracles main bi challenge will continue to be a fine balancing act supporting multiple redundant and overlapping products versus bringing the strategic products closer together and integrating the platform ui and other core features
8310681 sas remains the best game in town for fully integrated high end analytics from a single vendor
8310682 even though several other vendors realise or are starting to realise the value of providing higher end analytics tools like statistical analysis and predictive modeling sas is pretty hard to beat in this category especially when it comes to embedding such analytical routines in powerful dbms engines like teradata sas also continues to differentiate itself in many areas of functional subject matter expertise including but not limited to areas like marketing analytics and risk management we see no reason sas cant continue on its amazing track record of uninterrupted 32 year growth
8310683 lots of guys can play quarterback in the nfl on first and second downs
8310684 what drivers dont realize is that ethanol is one third less energy per gallon
8310685 so if i have a gallon of gas sitting here and a gallon of ethanol im going to get more energy out of a gallon of gas than on a gallon of ethanol
8310686 virtually every car on the road runs on e10 just fine with no problems whatsoever
8310687 you can immediately go to 14 billion gallons of ethanol without having to worry about infrastructure concerns like the cars engine or gas pumps or anything like that
8310688 so if you have a non ffv and you pump it into your vehicle youre going to have a very serious large expense in front of you to the tune of thousands of dollars vehicles that dont run on e85 if you do pump it into those vehicles the problem is it will corrode the fuel lines the tank the fuel pump destroy the fuel filter etc
8310689 if you are comparing performance and that kind of stuff e85 is an extremely high performance fuel and thats why the indy racing league runs exclusively on ethanol
8310690 today ethanol is becoming far more of a viable alternative to gasoline as will other technologies like hybrids and plug in hybrids and all of this other stuff that will come its ethanol that is the first foot in the door
8310691 the energy crisis is this country today is such that we cant afford to take any options off the table biofuels and ethanol in particular offer us a very logical and a very easy first step
8310692 hey we should get to be qb of the future

8310715 since the league was founded in 1995 the w league has been the cornerstone for womens elite club soccer for 14 years providing a home for the worlds best players and developing the stars of the future
8310716 the players gathering for the combine are among the best in the league over the past few years and include many that may become household names with wps clubs or beyond in the near future history has shown usls dedication to development of the female player and the womens game to be of the highest caliber and we are confident the wps coaches general managers and scouts on hand will be in agreement in september
8310717 he knows exactly the physical and mental abuse this boy went through yet it didnt stop him
8310718 in fact he went one step further by tying him down when he abused him
8310719 my argument to the jury was always that what he did was wrong but he did it out of love
8310720 im going over here to try to make myself a better racecar driver
8310721 i wanted to be more competitive and i wanted to have some more opportunities to win races and things like that
8310722 looking at the parts we are playing im very concerned about what you think of us
8310723 like george im not sure if i should be flattered or insulted
8310724 have you seen the film and you call that a love letter
8310725 we started writing the movie as kind of an exercise thinking of what kind of parts these actors might play what kind of story they might inhabit
8310726 its really a funny script i didnt feel any need to wander off the script
8310727 he doesnt consider any other possibility other than what he thinks will happen i pretty much ran with that
8310728 theres something really really funny in terms of my character being so angry all the time

8310730 the stars of the convention should be the people who are being elected
8310731 my grandfather died last year my wifes grandfather died last year all our pictures were the biggest thing that we lost
8310732 no one ever told us that they were turned off
8310733 these hydrants need to be cut off in a way to prevent vandalism or any kind of terrorist activity including something in the water lines
8310734 all our fire departments at least the local ones i know were notified of that
8310735 it was a tragic situation we dont like to see that happen to anybody especially one of our water customers
8310736 the juices are flowing just because the first game is coming
8310737 yeah i thought we had a really good preseason were excited about our execution
8310738 we came out and we got into training camp at the beginning it was the best the offense has started for us at camp
8310739 usually the defense is far and away ahead but having the guys that we had at certain positions we were able to kind of pick up where we left off and go from there and it was important to get that feeling of confidence
8310740 actually this might be the easiest week for a lot of guys
8310741 this is obviously an opportunity for all of us especially for the starters and the guys who are going to go into the season full steam ahead to kind of get our legs back get refreshed and then be ready to go next week
8310742 last year we came out of the gate pretty good in that first game
8310743 were a pretty veteran group experienced especially offensive i think well be ok
8310744 will finally get the chance to experience a night of music and history they have been waiting decades for
8310745 were not opposed to private sector involvement in the delivery of electricity per se
8310746 its sort of hooray and oh shit in the same breath
8310747 for this next critical stage of the age we would have fresh editorial and executive leadership
8310748 the company has been taken over by a bunch of hillbillies who think they can run the paper like the benalla bugle
8310749 to all those who are being affected by these sorts of reorganisations shuffling etcetera it is going to be a very bleak christmas for thousands of australians
8310750 while the staff have had differences with andrew jaspan he did at least recognise that the future of newspapers in the new media world would be highly dependent on quality journalism
8310751 the management of the company appear not to be at all concerned about the delivery of quality journalism
8310752 further cuts will erode the newspaper any further depletion of resources will mean that not only staff will be the losers but so will the company the polity and the communities we serve
8310753 there is a new wave appearing at fairfax media which is all about low cost low quality journalism and andrew jaspan is just the first of many people to experience the wrath of the company and to be dismissed
8310754 the july 11 launch of the apple iphone 3g the first release of the iphone in the japanese market was met with much anticipation and enthusiasm

8310756 despite todays mass meeting at festival hall construction companies can still provide their employees with more flexible non union agreements
8310757 there is the opportunity to get a better deal with the benefits of freedom of choice
8310758 despite some companies accepting the rollover agreement as a commercial imperative there is still room for improvement and more flexible options for others in the building industry
8310759 the cfmeu working day calendar is inflexible for employers and employees and underlines the excessive power exercised by the union over the building industry
8310760 we expect all the major companies to fall in line with this agreement
8310761 we have developed this agreement with no industrial action if they are looking to turn back to where it was in 2004 theyre the ones that locked out our members in the construction industry they should seriously look at the path they are going down and they will be bringing havoc to the construction industry not the construction unions
8310762 ive been without a job for eight months now and i know theres no way i could secure a job for the rest of the year
8310763 but here comes a chance for me i will fight for a place in the australian seasonal employment scheme i know the competition will be high but if i dont get a chance this year i will try again next year
8310764 there needs to be better pre departure briefings so they can make an informed decision to whether they take up offers of work not just about wages and conditions but also the broader questions relating to accommodation and social issues such as drinking gambling and the cost of sending money home
8310765 the lesson from new zealand is that there needs to be a co ordinated approach from government unions welfare organisations including the church about how to help with community integration
8310766 we appreciate that some potential workers may have significant adjustment challenges to face
8310767 peoples english is not as good they get overwhelmed have financial problems or illness they get depressed and fail their studies and next thing they know they are on a rollercoaster and have lost control of their lives
8310768 the trauma period is within a few to 10 days especially if they dont know how long they would be incarcerated for
8310769 i am not a criminal i am a student and want to study electrical engineering people arrested me and put me in a cell like i am a terrorist my hair still rises on my body thinking about villawood
8310770 should minimise the need for detention and ensure a proper allowance for associated refugee claims
8310771 shocking to know that its such a big export industry for australia where students are treated as cash cows yet others are receiving such harsh treatment in detention if they overstay they should be deported
8310772 online programs offer socialization opportunities that go beyond what many traditional schools can provide understanding the realities of how the online environment eliminates or greatly reduces issues that may create social friction with kids such as appearance physical disabilities gender age ethnicity or socioeconomic status can enhance a students ability to focus on academic progress in their courses while engaging in rich discussions and projects with classmates they might never have the opportunity to know otherwise
8310773 online learnings capacity to foster interaction and collaboration among a diverse and geographically dispersed group of students is among its most positive attributes
8310774 over the next few months and years as we renew domestic contracts
8310775 we will recover as much as we can if not all of the new tax burden
8310776 what i can say is that our current domestic contracts are in place and will be honoured
8310777 we in general have no ability to pass on this additional impost
8310778 i do not recall woodside offering to cut gas prices or repay the windfall they received when the excise rate was cut in 2001
8310779 it beggars belief that you can take 2 5 billion off the bottom line of a company like woodside and not have that passed on to australians in other ways
8310780 im advised in part its not likely to have any impact on domestic gas prices
8310781 in my view to withdraw in this manner showed disrespect to this court more critically it showed gross disrespect to mr knights family
8310782 such insensitive conduct does not in my opinion have any place in this jurisdiction
8310783 i can say with some feeling that there was certainly no discourtesy intended to the court or to the knight family
8310784 we are sorry if our actions have inadvertently caused offence
8310785 clearly it would not be best practice to mine an area associated with rockfalls and identified as a high seismic risk in such a fashion
8310786 it was quite alarming why would you continue to use 2 4m
8310787 tough action is necessary and the tough action our reform demands will be rewarded
8310788 the government is committed to investing substantially in our schools to deliver better outcomes but were not making investments without demanding accountability in return
8310789 there is little doubt that greater transparency will reveal some schools in australia may be seriously underperforming and have been struggling for some time
8310790 kids going to average schools deserve any opportunity that kids at flash schools have and this is the way there
8310791 weve seen what league tables can do in the uk weve seen cases of parents fighting with each other buying addresses raffle tickets so you can get in the line to get into a school thats higher up the league table
8310792 its often based on incorrect information and theres much more to a school than the academic results for a start
8310793 the coalition welcomes the fact that mr rudd is now following our agenda for higher standards and quality in schools but talk is no substitute for action
8310794 mr rudds pressing priority is to lift economic confidence and certainty for australians and australian businesses that are worse off under his government
8310795 but i guess you could make a pretty strong case for brown
8310796 beauty seen is never lost gods colors all are fast
8310797 one of the most poor and disenfranchised people in this country
8310798 i havent heard from them but when this issue came up at the last alp national conference i said to kevin rudd what you have got to understand about this decision about mining uranium mining is a decision for the states if the people in south australia are happy thats their decision
8310799 i was of the view that it was enough for me to say that as long as i am premier there will be no uranium mining in wa but i listened to what other people had to say and i was convinced by them that it should go beyond just the whim of the premier of the day
8310800 we strongly believe that uranium mining could be an opportunity for our people to generate equity and commercial benefit and importantly play an important part in the development of significant resources projects for this state
8310801 this is an important inter generational issue for our people and its an issue that martu should be able to consider and make decisions about in an informed manner especially as a means of achieving economic and social outcomes for a group of people who continue to be under serviced by state government
8310802 by proposing to ban uranium mining the premier and state alp government are effectively robbing one of the most poor and disenfranchised people in this country of the right to earn a living and potentially achieve an equity stake in a major mining project
8310803 just be yourselves be who you are nobody today cares about peoples sexual orientation
8310804 you know what i feel like i feel all the time like a cat on a hot tin roof

8310806 shona urvashis first film chupke se was a disaster nobody knows about her first film this is her second film i hope she makes a better film this time
8310807 i signed because warner brothers who are producing the film had approached me warner brothers is an international giant so i could not refuse them
8310808 they are senior actors with a lot of experience i had a great learning experience while working with them in the movie
8310809 i am playing a character which is more real and underplayed it has been an experimental experience as i have done something which i had never done before
8310810 i wont reveal much about what i do in the movie as that will take away the charm of watching it but one thing i can say for sure is that people will not see me running around trees or performing any dance or item numbers
8310811 i know pds shoppers have been retaining bpl cards from the poor and selling rice wheat and kerosene in the black market i will make surprise checks and those ration shoppers found guilty would be sent to jail
8310812 nearly 25 lakh people are waging a grim battle against the floods which have assumed proportions of a catastrophe the nature is putting my government to test once again but we will succeed

8310814 were not just out there trying to line everyones pockets
8310815 we could see that the buyback was going to be 10 years of pain
8310816 we decided to come up with something which is a realistic price for water purchase it doesnt actually just try to cover the water purchase its there as a trigger for people to make a decision on whether they want to remain in the industry or whether they can see the writing on the wall and want to exit
8310817 there will be meaningful outcome with this plan put in place because it will achieve
8310818 any proposed offer must provide value for money and have environmental benefits
8310819 we are open to speaking with any willing sellers of water entitlements in the murray darling basin as we work to return water to our rivers
8310820 it shipped media mail and it takes forever and a day to get to you be patient on your sorry self

8310824 we continue to make hersheys hersheys kisses and reeses peanut butter cups with pure milk chocolate as we have for over a century as a matter of fact our portfolio includes far more pure milk and dark chocolate than any of our competitors
8310825 stabilized rice bran can in fact have a very definitive role in reducing formulation costs while in many cases improving the nutritional profile of a processed food
8310826 rice bran nutraceas ribran isolate was recently approved by usda for inclusion in comminuted meat and poultry products
8310827 its role is that of an extender and binder and it demonstrates significant cost savings to manufacturers as they replace meat and more expensive soy based and other ingredients
8310828 a relatively small inclusion of rice bran in batter mixes has the effect of extending the batter due to higher water absorption while blocking fat uptake in the deep fryer
8310829 operators and manufacturers are especially interested in reduced oil uptake for the favorable nutritional impact as well as the significant cost savings associated with reduced edible oil usage

8310836 it is crucial that any new technology has the support of consumers if it is to be successful
8310837 scientists and manufacturers have to prove the case for new technology before it can be presented to consumers
8310838 with the purchase of posilac elanco can enhance its overall product portfolio and work together with the industry to provide dairy farmers more options and give consumers affordable choices
8310839 critically we remain focused on the health and care of the cow in working with farmers to increase global milk supply
8310840 in countries like india the dairy sector is responding to demand growth by improving cows diets and boosting milk output
8310841 globally it is by focusing on the nutritional requirements of cattle that we will raise milk production
8310842 m any dairy processors are offering products made with milk from cows not treated with rbst and they make that clear with production claims on their product labels
8310843 the claims simply provide information that consumers want they do not reflect any health or safety issues
8310844 it is used by farmers to increase the milk production of their herds so that they can reap more money
8310845 there is increased turnover in cows treated with synthetic growth hormones

8310848 with consumers staying at home more and the continuing expansion of our presence in grocery mass market and specialty retailers along with strong performance in the natural channel we are seeing indications that consumers have prioritized leading a healthy lifestyle despite the challenging economy and inflationary pressures
8310849 additionally consumers are seeking more natural and organic foods and poultry to replace more costly meat products
8310850 the general trend among us food manufacturers is either no growth or good growth in revenue but falling net income because of costs
8310851 the companies that are most able to weather the storm are companies with diversified and specialized products

8310884 da tempo ludc aveva posto lattenzione sulle aree agricole e sul censimento delle stesse
8310885 e stata necessaria la violenza su i due turisti olandesi per capire che a roma sono centinaia le strutture ex agricole abbandonate e occupate da clandestini e da persone senza fissa dimora

8310947 suppose for example youre a voter and you have candidate x and you have candidate y
8310948 candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything candidate y disagrees with you on half the issues but you believe that on the other half the candidate will be able to deliver
8310949 this is the kind of question that i predict and this has nothing to do with whats going on now but i am just saying if you look at five 10 15 years from now you may actually see this delivery issue become a serious issue in democratic debates because it is so hard to figure out how to turn good intentions into real changes in the lives of the people we represent

8310956 the surveys so far institutional and government based are not comprehensive they report wrong and misleading numbers of illegal practices of manual scavenging we will demand for identification of scavengers through comprehensive reliable survey methods
8310957 the practice of manual scavenging exists unchecked from kashmir to kanyakumari many cases remain unidentified and ignored by local authorities who claim they arent accountable
8310958 scavenging is something that is handed down to daughter in laws and passed on to generations after soon after my marriage i was given a cane basket and told that clearing toilets is my destiny i felt shattered
8310959 if you dare to go against caste norms and leave the practice you have to deal with the social and economic ostracisation that follows
8310960 the government of india has not only missed the mark but denies defiantly any existence of such practice whatsoever the practice of manual scavenging exists as a reminder of worst form of caste bondage in our society
8310961 the government and society is in denial even with adequate fund allocation the political will to address the issue does not exist

8310976 rest to a bitter primary battle that left many of her supporters especially women seething months later
8310977 the most recent washington post abc news poll showed that only 42 percent of clinton voters classify themselves as solidly behind obama and 20 percent plan to vote for mccain
8310978 but in denver clinton supporters sometimes classified themselves as belonging to one of two categories the sad and the angry
8310979 a nettlesome problem that appears to be contributing to the campaigns failure to keep pace with ambitious fund raising goals it set for the general election
8310980 has led mccain in the head to head surveys most of the summer but things at the moment appear to be changing
8310981 if barack obama gets the traditional post convention bounce in the polls it cant come soon enough
8310982 artillery fire and helicopter gunships engaged a militants hideout in raghan area of bajaur district twenty five miscreants including important local taliban commanders and some foreign fighters were killed in the action
8310983 following the incident the taliban cordoned off the area and no one is allowed to go there
8310984 the preliminary investigations indicate that three to four kilograms of explosives was used in the bomb
8310985 i think she was talking to bill clinton as much as she was to the rest of us
8310986 i speak to you as a woman as a mother as a senator and as an american she didnt say anything about being a wife i just think she was sending a message to bill clinton you better match my commitment

8310988 condemns the decision of the russian federation to extend recognition to the south ossetia and abkhazia regions of georgia and calls upon russia to reverse its decision

8311027 the united states oil production peaked at 10 million barrels a day during the 1970s
8311028 today were producing half of that with absolutely no hope of increasing production even if we opened up the entire country and looked for it its just not there
8311029 this is the greatest transfer of wealth from one area to another in the history of mankind and this country just cant stand it but there are ways to make a dent in our dependence on foreign oil
8311030 natural gas is a cleaner fuel source and north america has an abundance of supply to tap into
8311031 just look at whats occurring with shale development throughout the country its real and its happening everywhere from northeast british columbia to the barnett shale in texas from the appalachian basin to the fayetteville shale in alabama in todays business and economic environment natural gas is much more exciting and promising than oil it is the premium fossil fuel

8311037 marc faber would rather buy gold at this stage than oil
8311038 its going to be at least three months so they had to make room on the roster
8311039 with the way we played its just the right thing to do
8311040 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8311041 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8311042 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8311043 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8311044 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8311045 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8311046 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8311047 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8311048 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8311049 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

8311054 this is a serious situation the intruders sneaked into the indian side under the cover of fire which was most probably provided by the pakistani rangers
8311055 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8311056 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8311057 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8311058 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8311059 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8311060 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8311061 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8311062 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8311063 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8311064 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8311065 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8311066 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8311067 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8311068 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8311069 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8311070 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8311071 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8311072 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8311073 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8311074 mirc options expand connect tab options perfom tick enable perform on connect
8311075 ahhh this is usesless or this is pointless why would you even post this
8311076 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8311077 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8311078 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8311079 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8311080 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8311081 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8311082 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8311083 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8311084 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8311085 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8311086 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8311087 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8311088 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8311089 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8311090 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8311091 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8311092 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8311093 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8311094 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8311095 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8311096 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8311097 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8311098 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8311099 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8311100 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8311101 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8311102 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8311103 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8311104 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8311105 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8311106 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8311107 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8311108 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8311109 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8311110 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8311111 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8311112 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8311113 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8311114 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8311115 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8311116 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8311117 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8311118 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8311119 based on what were seeing already this country hasnt seen anything yet in terms of the severity of combat trauma and veteran suicide rates
8311120 compared to spinal fusion this surgery allows patients to maintain normal neck motion and study has shown a lower rate of additional surgery for degeneration of adjacent segments unlike with fusion patients whove received the disc dont have to bother with a hard collar following surgery
8311121 study results show that artificial cervical disc patients regain function faster and have a higher rate of neurological success as measured by muscle tone strength sensation as well as responsiveness of reflexes than those who undergo spinal fusion furthermore the study demonstrated that at two year follow up the overall success rate for the artificial disc group was 79 3 compared to the fusion group at 67 8 these reasons are compelling enough for potential candidates to consider the option of an artificial disc
8311122 well actually have somewhat of a game plan whereas the first two games we didnt
8311123 so we have a very scaled down version of the game plan well go in and weve watched a little film on washington
8311124 we had a route that jason held the ball and we had a vertical outside that was an easy touchdown
8311125 honestly it was an easy touchdown and we just didnt see it he didnt focus on it and then he turned back in and tried to throw the ball over the middle to the tight end and the route wasnt there
8311126 como nos anos anteriores o que se espera o cumprimento da meta fiscal

8311130 acho que ele bebeto tem condi o de jogar no corinthians bebeto fez uma das melhoras duplas de ataque que eu j treinei dauri e bebeto no 15 de novembro de campo bom em 2004 a ponto de o dauri ser chuteira de ouro no futebol brasileiro at maio daquele ano mas depois obviamente ele n o conseguiu manter
8311131 o futebol brasileiro muito rico temos muitos bons jogadores com talento que pelas condi es naturais n o recebem oportunidades maiores bebeto tem condi es de jogar aqui acreditei nele e defendi isso para a diretoria
8311132 incita o guerra civil e a conflitos religiosos no l bano
8311133 muito prov vel que fa amos o filme aqui e essa nossa vontade sinto grande confian a em todos
8311134 este n o um filme sobre a guerra a hist ria se passa no teatro de guerra mas sobre pessoas
8311135 quando ele foi eleito eu tive uma preocupa o de que levasse o governo para uma linha de esquerda mas ele foi mais conservador do que eu esperava
8311136 n o h nenhum sinal de tens o no mercado financeiro
8311137 he was very accurate throwing the ball but his decision making was average
8311138 even on the big play he made throwing to jason goode that was not a great decision but a very fortunate completion the decisions he made to throw to the corner route and the scramble play he made to throw a touchdown to marcus mason were awesome
8311139 yo soy el nico vocero del gobierno para las reformas

8311145 es un poco de debilidad en todos los pa ses con la excepci n de alemania y francia donde estamos viendo mercados fuertes
8311146 la idea es tomar una serie de acciones que nos permitan reducir el tema de habitantes de calle en los pr ximos cuatro a os pero igualmente generarle unas condiciones para estas personas
8311147 en el programa de moreno este tipo de poblaci n desapareci totalmente si no se adoptan pol ticas definitivas es muy posible que siga incrementado porque la soluci n no es darles comida y ba arlos hay que buscar programas de rehabilitaci n verdaderos
8311148 yo creo que el gobierno est subestimando lo que pasa en estas zonas que no s lo se convierten en el lugar donde van a dormir quienes viven en la calle all se trafican drogas armas y se delinque
8311149 el tema no tiene que ver con pobreza sino con adicciones y eso es mucho m s dif cil lo que pasa es que el proceso de cada una de estas personas vale por lo menos 10 millones de pesos y requiere de tiempo y compromiso las 24 horas
8311150 que pena que uribe se defienda con su rabia y no con su inteligencia

8311209 hey if you are burning or downloading 15 20 songs per month why not get paid to do it and get your friends involved
8311210 but as long as they keep paying to stay in burnlounge
8311211 taking other peoples money without giving them the support they need to succeed
8311212 the poor dude at the bottom who cant sign anyone up
8311213 have to spend 20 per month whether they want to or not
8311214 people that think they could be the next seymour stein or chris blackwell
8311215 this relationship benefits our community by getting them special access to venues and their vip rooms but it also provides burnlounge with incredible visibility to thousands of concertgoers in key markets
8311216 enjoying success in burnlounge without these secrets is like trying to cross the atlantic ocean in an inflatable raft maybe it can be done but the failure rate is enormous
8311217 you dont know it but the heavy hitters in burnlounge are keeping some big secrets from you
8311218 people shouldnt have to have a requirement like that how dare this company think that they have the right to force people to do business
8311219 if you dont work on it as a business it wont grow
8311220 if you werent spending all your time putting down burnlounge maybe youd make some money
8311221 this is an mlm you will make your money by getting people under
8311222 your physiological incapability to understand whats going on here or how it works does not translate to me being greedy
8311223 whatever you think im psychologically incable of you seem to be incredibly adept at avoidance
8311224 5 barry let me correct you you never told me about the deal with ticketmaster you simply said burnlounge will be selling tickets soon and that they will surpass ticketmaster in terms of sales because of the power of the burnlounge revolution
8311225 they also talked about adding movies ibooks tickets ring tones and cell phones calling plans and more in the not too distant future some of which obviously would have a higher profit margin than music downloads
8311226 and as ive also said about a million times right now its just music but theyre working to expand into movies ringtones cell phones concert tickets games ebooks and more so your thing about people running out of things to download holds zero water yes zero
8311227 so barry what do you say now let me say this that even if ticketmaster opened up all tickets to burnloungers to sell ticketmaster will still sell infinitely more because of a brand recognition and b theyll sell at the box office and many burnloungers wont move as fast with many tickets then unavailable to the burnlounge buyer its not the cash cow you think my friend
8311228 the way you bring the negative light to things is unbelieveable did i ever say that burnlounge would ever take on ticket master and drive them into the ground until they beg to be bought or did i simply say that one of the products burnlounge was planning on bringing in was concert tickets for gods sake tony stop with the drama already youre just hell bent on de legitimizing this company
8311229 promises profits if you invest your own money in it show me where it says that tony oh it doesnt so i guess you made it up then
8311230 certainly does promise profits if you invest your money into it
8311231 top 70 000 list on myspace i value their friendship as well as appreciate the revenues the provide for me
8311232 oh you dont even have to sell any downloads just sit back and do
8311233 if it sounds too good to be true than it really is good concept but with no integrity to back it up just glad i didnt waste my 400 dollars like i said i know many people who didnt make there money back
8311234 and what about the people in this country who dont speak english what about them
8311235 uh oh theres little growth here the digital music market is leveling off and were stuck with windows drm baaaaad move
8311236 so you think burnlounge is going to be able to compete with at amp t and
8311237 son if you take this job you can make money you can be your own boss you can revolutionize the world you can change consumer behavior and with that get rich rich rich
8311238 by 2002 excel had entered the local phone service market more aggressively than smaller competitors such as mcis neighborhood however the gross margins associated with long distance telephone service dropped precipitously during the period from 1998 through 2003 due to the entry of numerous competitors and additional line capacity into this sector as such the profitability of excel and almost every other teleccommunications firm dependent upon long distance calling customer dropped precipitously
8311239 excel had 106 426 u s representatives eligible to earn commissions and that 64 967 actually earned commissions of those 98 1 percent earned 100 or less only 99 or 0 2 percent earned more than 1 000 for the month
8311240 most recruits pay 195 to join often mesmerized by visions of emulating orberson excel is the countrys fifth largest long distance company with 4 1 million customers but excel also boasts 1 million sales reps that means the average excel rep has only four customers and one of them is himself no wonder the turnover is so high
8311241 in the manner of a chain letter scheme the pyramid relies on a stream of new recruits for its prosperity the company netted a fat 144 million on revenue of 1 4 billion last year minus the 195 recruiting fees though excel would have been in the red
8311242 how can it help me in the long run to sign up folks to compete with me for the same market share how can signing up competitors be a good business model
8311243 my commissions are getting smaller because im not signing up people directly hes signing up people in my chain sure im getting a percentage of his commissions for doing nothing but im not getting the full value of that person ive diluted my own profits because now im just letting someone else do the work sure i get something but i dont get the total fee and now im losing money being out here competing with my own sign up
8311244 my commissions are getting smaller because im not signing up people directly
8311245 most of the people in mlm sign up people they already know not complete strangers

8311266 if id known this would be the result of breaking the law i would never have done it
8311267 this man not only abused the vulnerability of these children but also went against the wishes of his own community as well as knowingly breaking the law
8311268 the sensitivities this case raises both legal and cultural are significant
8311269 was not an attack upon the practices or ceremonies of shia muslims
8311270 indeed the prosecution relied as part of its evidence upon the president of the local shia community centre
8311271 we are satisfied that given the age of the children involved the coercion employed by syed mustafa zaidi who did not accept that he was wrong and the possibility of such an incident occurring again the decision to prosecute by the crown prosecution service was the correct one
8311272 this is a very unusual case and the first of its kind to be prosecuted by the cps in england and wales
8311273 its always important to know what our faith actually teaches

8311396 you cant take everything to the dump because the dump wont take it
8311397 i think what the dec should do is meet with the farm bureau and representatives of the agricultural community
8311398 i think based on talking to the farmers throughout the region that this would be a detriment to them for a lot of different reasons
8311399 that smoke came all the way up here to rushville
8311400 theres enough junk being put into the air by our cars diesel engines all that stuff to me theres just no reason whatsoever to burn
8311401 i have a lot of opinions about it both as a citizen and as a town supervisor
8311402 i can see a lot of people wont be able to afford 3 50 to 5 a bag when they take their trash to the dump so theyre going to end up tossing it along the side of the road or along their back 40
8311403 but its going to cost them money that they simply dont have

8311405 come from the environs of new york city all of them and they do not understand country life at all

8311407 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure where its heading
8311408 for that reason everyone in gulf needs to be monitoring the storm at that point were expecting it to be a category 3 hurricane

8311414 our annual inspections that go above and beyond federal requirements confirm that the bay bridge is safe
8311415 since the aug 10 incident we have been aggressively assessing bridge operations and structural elements in depth testing done to date shows that improvements can be made to strengthen the parapet out of an abundance of caution we want to execute these modifications immediately
8311416 the reality is that diminished capacity will lead to delays particularly during the upcoming labor day weekend but the safety of our motorists employees and contractors is our top priority
8311417 were asking our bridge commuters and local residents to work with us again during these modifications were also encouraging labor day beachgoers to use alternate routes and avoid the bay bridge this weekend if possible drivers should plan their trips by calling 1 877 bayspan 229 7726 and logging onto baybridge com
8311418 the repairs we are starting today will restore the strength of the parapet
8311419 the corrosion is a direct result of voids in the center of the concrete parapet where moisture has become trapped if our ongoing testing identifies other parapet areas in need of strengthening immediate corrective action will begin and could take up to 10 weeks for such repairs

8311423 the free markets the best mechanism ever devised to put resources to their most efficient and productive use
8311424 the government isnt particularily good at that but the amrket isnt so good at making sure the wealth thats produced is being distributed fairly or wisely some of thatw ealth has to be plowed back into education so that the next generation has a fair chance and to maintain our infrastructure and provide some sort of safety net for those who lose out in a market economy and it makes sense that those of us whove benefited most from the market should pay a bigger share
8311425 youre basically handing over command of the contrys resources to people who didnt earn it its like choosing the 2020 olympic team by picking the children of all the winners at the 2000 games
8311426 they have this idea that its their money and they deserve to keep every penny of it
8311427 but i was lucky enough to be born in a time and place where society values my talent and gave me a good education to develop that talent and set up laws and the financial system to let me do what i love doing and make alot of money doing it the least i can do is help pay for all that

8311436 in a time of hype telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
8311437 hundreds of heavily armed officers some clad in riot gear or hanging off suvs are saturating denvers streets in unprecedented numbers quickly isolating any hint of trouble that could tarnish the citys reputation under the limelight of the democratic national convention

8311446 then i read g r taylors 1950 book hamilton and the national debt which described the debate over alexander hamiltons plan to fund the new economy with borrowed money
8311447 the most revealing account was a speech by the first congressman from georgia james jackson on february 9 1790 in which he predicted that adoption of hamilton s funding plan would lead to the explosive growth of debt
8311448 loans created only the principal interest had to be paid out of principal so payment of interest reduced the money supply and slowed economic activity recovery could come only when new loans were taken out at least equal to interest paid
8311449 as long as the money supply of a nation is created as debt costing interest debt must grow by compound interest
8311450 we are buying more and more in the same amount of time witness the efforts of people to get rid of their excess through yard sales storage units and big trash pickup days and the massive size of what are euphemistically called landfills while two billion people in the world lack basics such as clean water food and shelter americans throw away their microwave ovens televisions computers refrigerators furniture and cars meanwhile acceleration is applauded as increasing productivity its like arguing that cancer is good because it grows
8311451 stop using percentage rates to calculate charges for the use of money

8312103 the cyclical upswing in commodity prices from the low in october 2001 at 226 8 per cent is now virtually on par with the huge 235 1 per cent advance in the 1970s in the aftermath of the arab oil embargo

8312200 when he first introduced himself that night we had no idea who he was

8312237 most of our domestic airlines have international fleets and we dont ignore that so we have been not just watching whats going on in the satellite arena but have been testing it ourselves and talking to potential partners
8312238 from a general aviation side we have quite a bit of experience with satellite communications in airplanes we are very cognisant and are pretty much technology agnostic
8312239 the technological base of our industry has not been renewedsince the 1980s thats why we are so far behind

8312432 house settling car passing metal gate lightly scraping the cement the gate i suppose it could have been the neighbors gate sound travels well enough in the quiet of night it sure did sound just like one of ours though perhaps a neighbors cat pushed it open quiet soft rattling metallic sound what was that
8312433 uh hmmm ok dont be alarmed its probably nothing maybe the neighbors needed to walk through there for some unusual reason maybe you imagined it and besides you always check to make sure the doors and windows are locked before bed you checked the front door the living room window in the front the kitchen window the you know i dont remember checking the dining room window in the back and i was cleaning windows today yes and i had to open and close that dining room window a couple of times as i scrubbed bird crud because i couldnt tell if it was clean yet and i dont remember locking it when i closed it and saw that it was finally clean did i oh no i didnt lock it that window is unlocked

8312446 to say that they are just cosmetic changes is not true it is something that will really change the university environment
8312447 actually the university environment will more or less stay the same but certain parties are politicising it the issue saying the students are being repressed
8312448 the enrolment of the private colleges is already 340 000 compared to 360 000 in public universities their admission of international students is also at 30 000 while public universities have 10 000 foreign students

8312459 hi arts ballantyne house 84 academy street inverness iv1 1lu scotland
8312460 it was a declaration of war a national security issue and a very real possibility of major danger for the buildings and staff of random house and widespread violence
8312461 i am very disappointed to hear that my publishers random house have canceled another authors novel apparently because of their concerns about possible islamic reprisals this is censorship by fear and it sets a very bad precedent indeed
8312462 in the last 12 months or so its the companies under liquidity pressure and funding pressure that have led to non compliance
8312463 listing fee revenues are recognized over a multi year period which will even out changes up or down in listing activities
8312464 a pent up demand as the credit crisis plays out
8312465 youre going to see an explosion in ipos and new share issuances as the economic environment becomes more favorable
8312466 some of the largest companies in the world are doing a lot of substantial share offering while a lot of attrition in the listings is concentrated among smaller weaker companies

8312468 yes that was too much next time you get a great hit theyll have to control themselves better huh
8312469 oh no lord i wish he wasnt in this particular position
8312470 wouldnt it be amazing for him to experience getting a hit even just once this year
8312471 i am disappointed in the transgender community they seem to think that if nancy pelosi and myself george miller and a few others waved a magic wand we could deliver it
8312472 i hope that maybe this device of the declaration of falsity is another way of pursuing these matters instead of going for the mega bucks you simply go to court for the important thing which is to establish whats true and whats not i think its a clearer and simpler way of dealing with this and im very pleased weve been able to use it in this way
8312473 a culture that respects human life must have a joyful acceptance of human suffering
8312474 i dont mean by that letter that we have to stop the peace process and just discuss the security of my person

8312479 we shall soon be setting up a government the mdc does not want to come in apparently
8312480 this time they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating that in six months time the government will collapse
8312481 i do not know when that day will come i wish mdc leader morgan tsvangirai well on that day
8312482 its very clear that if he announces the new cabinet its a declaration of war against the people you cant just have a cabinet without a mandate
8312483 he should wait for the conclusion of the dialogue together with the mdc and mr tsvangirai on the way forward otherwise what he is doing is a recipe for disaster
8312484 the talks have not been formally terminated so the natural conclusion is that the talks are on
8312485 but there hasnt been any formal communication from sadc from president mbeki to say this is the way forward
8312486 we are actually looking forward to the conclusion of the dialogue when mugabe and mdc leader morgan tsvangirai form a transitional government
8312487 he is now left with limited options and is faced with signs of disunity within his zanu pf members
8312488 mugabe is a skilled political warhorse who has done so much to buy time for his term in power he can only lose through talks
8312489 that character was such a big part of my life
8312490 i figure kelly went through so many crazy traumatic experiences in the cult and the fire getting shot getting stalked that i really thought she had a lot to give back
8312491 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me

8312494 conventions are an opportunity for corporations to do what theyre not normally permitted to do subsidize campaigns with unlimited amounts of money right out of their treasuries

8312508 we are still in the process of making our precise calculations to ask the wto arbitration panel but it is certainly very high because the harm the subsidies cause is very big it is something certainly in the area of billions

8312564 this discovery enables us to offer the first genetic tests to families affected by the inherited form of this disease
8312565 furthermore because there already are drugs in development that target the same gene in adult cancers we can soon begin testing those drugs in children with neuroblastoma
8312566 our results demonstrate that heritable mutations of alk are the main cause of familial neuroblastoma and that germline or acquired activation of this cell surface kinase is a tractable therapeutic target for this lethal paediatric malignancy
8312567 it not only helps us understand the genetic roots of this terrible disease but also has led to dramatically new ideas for curative therapy
8312568 it was funny i thought he might have been rogans dad for a minute because there is such a physical resemblance there
8312569 when he first introduced himself that night we had no idea who he was
8312570 when we finally figured it out i think rogan and i just looked at each other and laughed then we spent about an hour together and talked about his work our work poetry art life things
8312571 als art is unguarded its not pretentious there is an honest story there but at the same time it has a bit of an edge to it where it feels like theres no camera there and our clothes sort of feel like there is no brand there
8312572 were not big retail or commercial minded people and art is an important inspiration behind what were doing
8312573 also this space used to be a theatre so it seemed appropriate

8312611 i knew herschel was going to be a great player
8312612 the question in my mind was how soon was he going to be great particularly coming out of a class a school the smallest classification i wasnt sure
8312613 on the other hand i was certainly going to give him the opportunity to see if he can make the adjustment
8312614 by the time we got to herschel there was no question in anybodys mind herschel was in a class by himself
8312615 he made an immediate impact and he did it in front of the players the coaches and all the georgia people by halftime he had earned the starting role
8312616 herschel ran right over two men they had him dead away inside the 9 herschel walker went 16 yards he drove right over those orange shirts and is just driving and running with those big thighs my god a freshman

8312626 ive always been an avid reader of charles bukowski this collection comes from late in his life and even includes two or three death bed poems one of the things that i like about him is that he captures what its like to be an artist in the aging process and the compulsion to create
8312627 this is a collection of humor by george carlin that contains three books brain droppings napalm and silly putty and when will jesus bring the pork chops a lot of it is just thoughts and off hand comments but he also talks about his feelings about the decay of human social structures i identify with his anarchic sense of humor

8312698 the judicial practice to which i have referred is inconsistent with the broad proposition that creditors cannot be deprived of their statutory rights under the english scheme of liquidation
8312699 this is a case in which it is appropriate to give the principle of universalism full reign
8312700 i do not propose to stray from the firm area of common ground allowing the appeal on the basis of s426 onto the controversial area of whether in the absence of statutory jurisdiction the same result could have been reached under a discretion available under the common law
8312701 the proposition that the assistance and directions sought could be given under an inhernet power of the court is unacceptable and would constitute the usurpation by the judiciary of a role expressly conferred by parliament on the secretary of state

8312703 i would allow this appeal but repeat that i would do so on the footing that the power to accede to the australian liquidators request derives from section 426 and not from any inherent jurisdiction of the court

8312756 thats a good question and i dont think that anybody knows the answer i think the real question on some of the delegates mind is whether or not the roll call will be more faux than fair
8312757 what i think theyre going to do and there may be some theater is that theyll have two states that are going to stand up and say we have 25 votes for obama and six and a half for hillary clinton and then the next one will say something and then someone will stand up and say we should all vote for obama and then there will be no protest or there will be a protest but human nature is such as to avoid conflict when possible i dont think there will be a protest

8312797 its physically impossible for us to do enough to deter the russians from further incursions so its not clear to me that military aid would be appreciably more than symbolic
8312798 its hard to imagine that the united states would embark on the process of rearming georgia until the conflict has reached a stable equilibrium that at least has the possibility of triggering some kind of military confrontation between the u s and russia

8312835 ce nest pas parce quils sont minoritaires quils ont raison
8312836 par ailleurs je me contente seulement de rappeler quen science le doute est salutaire
8312837 bien s r le parall le avec les cr ationistes est exag r mais ce n tait pas l le fond de largument je ne faisais pas une comparaison je voulais juste d montrer par labsurde que la phrase en question peut sappliquer tout et nimporte quoi puisque tout est susceptible de diviser la communaut scientifique
8312838 seulement face la question de lorigine humaine du r chauffement comme nimporte quelle question scientifique lourde de cons quences politiques il sagit de prendre des d cisions les politiques ne peuvent pas attendre une hypoth tique conclusion du d bat scientifique pour agir
8312839 comme la majorit des gens nous aimerons voir un monde meilleur ce qui se implique ici que nous travaillions r duire les risques dun changement climatique potentiellement catastrophique pour cela nous devons avoir des soutiens importants afin de frapper limagination du public ce qui suppose bien s r davoir un maximum de couverture m diatique pour cela nous devons proposer des sc narios effrayants faire des d clarations simples et dramatiques et viter de mentionner le moindre doute que nous pourrions avoir
8312840 on ne peut pas dire que le crime nait pas encore t commis comme le fait remarquer anonyme le r chauffement climatique est un fait observable empiriquement
8312841 mais il y a quelque chose de paradoxal repousser perp tuellement le moment o on conclura ou non lurgence do ma distinction entre d bat scientifique et politique
8312842 tu aurais du faire porter ta comparaison avec un jugement en r f r o des mesures conservatoires doivent tre prises pour pr server les droits du demandeur
8312843 si on consid re que pour d terminer sil y a urgence conclure sur une question il faut dabord r soudre cette question
8312844 ce nest pas diff rent de ce que fait le juge des r f r s lorsquil d cide quune demande motiv e par lurgence est recevable il ne dit pas encore si cette demande est fond e
8312845 le v ritable objet de mon article tait de conna tre les raisons qui peuvent pousser sopposer et m me militer contre la th orie de lorigine humaine du r chauffement et donc une prise en compte politique de pr occupations cologiques

8312848 cette question ma r ponse est oui si on est convaincu par une th orie ici l colosceptisme il me semble logique quon d fende cette position contre vents et mar es
8312849 si on lit cet article on y apprend que ces articles font tous partie de la m me base darchives ce qui peut entra ner un certain biais

8312970 these instructions are the final step in a tremendous effort to bring the form 990 up to date and to reflect the diversity and complexity of the tax exempt community

8313019 si tratta di un parere che non supera i limiti della liberta di espressione in una societ democratica
8313020 la corte ricorda che la liberta giornalistica puo includere la possibilit di utilizzare una certa quantita di provocazione inoltre le espressioni utilizzate dal denunciante non ha portato ad abusi e non dovrebbe essere considerata grauitamente offensiva essendo infatti in relazione con la situazione che commentavano

8313029 le universit pubbliche possono deliberare la propria trasformazione in fondazioni di diritto privato
8313030 ma occorre una regolamentazione molto pi chiara quali garanzie quali vantaggi si avranno dalleventuale trasformazione quante facolt dovranno avere le fondazioni quali tipologie di ateneo potranno beneficiare di pi da questo passaggio ununiversit statale un ente pubblico come un ministero ma a nessuno nemmeno nelle culture anglosassoni pi esasperate verrebbe in mente di trasformare in fondazione il dicastero di viale trastevere

8313081 we have been waiting some time for this decision from the fda and we are pleased to finally receive our clia waiver the granting of the clia waiver is expected to greatly impact our relationship with our laboratory alliance as up until this point the lab alliance has been obtaining clia waived devices from another supplier now that our rapid tox device is clia waived they will be obtaining all of their urine based point of collection devices from abmc
8313082 clia waiver also allows us to complete our negotiations with several distributors who service the physician and hospital market we are anxious to be able to penetrate new markets with our products and this waiver opens the first door for us i expect to see an immediate impact on sales beginning in the fourth quarter of this year and ramping up throughout 2009

8313086 kaminer is also an advisory board member woody is the chairman of the secular coalition for america which is
8313087 kay hagan is trying to run a campaign in north carolina that casts her as a moderate but the money thats paying for it is coming from the left wing fringe of political thought
8313088 you can tell a lot about a person by their friends and these are friends most north carolinians would not be comfortable having over for dinner
8313089 kay hagan does not represent the values of this state she is a trojan horse for a long list of wacky left wing outside groups bent on policies that would horrify most north carolinians if they knew about it
8313090 this latest revelation of support from anti religion activists will not sit well with
8313091 friends most north carolinians would not be comfortable having over for dinner

8313098 ikon operates more than 400 sales and services locations mainly in europe and the united states it has long and established business ties with many major customers in the u s
8313099 by combining the strengths of ikon and ricoh we can create a strong business entity
8313100 some of its clients may want to keep using canon products and they might switch to a canon distributor or to direct purchases from canon
8313101 on ikon employees they have been handling many canon products and have wide knowledge on canon machines some of them could move to dealers that offer canon products
8313102 this relationship enables draeger to provide a detailed level of clinical assistance and support that is not typically available to customers icon provides the 24x7 clinical support from simple troubleshooting to the most critical of issues
8313103 it is necessary for us to have the best in class support icon offers to go along with draegers innovative technology

8313107 the award of the environmental permit paves the way for drilling the first well in our large structure at rosablanca the environmental application included the first three well sites so permits are in hand to move on to rosablanca 2 when we are ready this exploration program complements our existing colombian production at the guaduas field very well and provides us the leveraged opportunity to rapidly grow our operations which is why we chose to focus on colombia in the first place
8313108 the environmental permit has been anticipated for some time but the activity level in colombia since osage has been involved there has reached boom proportions with both the ministry of mines and the anh literally buried under applications the high level of professionalism in the colombian agencies is very evident but patience is required when the workload is as heavy as it is now in colombia
8313109 because of how simple they look people hypothesized that trichoplax represented an early form of animal life other people thought they were just simplified cnidarians jellyfish and hydras
8313110 we wanted to figure out where they fit with other animals in particular the cnidarians the sponges and more complex animals
8313111 comparing its genome with other genomes can tell us what the basic molecular toolkit was in the common ancestor of all animals
8313112 if you want to understand the early origin and diversification of animals you have to infer this from the fossil record or the genome sequences of animals that lived and diverged early most of which didnt leave fossils
8313113 its remarkable that we have the whole genome sequence but we still know so little about this animal in the wild
8313114 hopefully the genome sequence will stimulate more studies of this enigmatic creature
8313115 some of our new placozoan species show frequent sexual reproduction while others never show any signs of sex
8313116 the genome data allow us to search for the genes responsible for sex and life cycle complexity
8313117 it can make a gut as needed so it could be the original proto animal

8313146 lets head for the bedroom where we can be more comfortable
8313147 we welcome bosch as one of our first fast logic portfolio licensees
8313148 we are actively engaging dozens of other companies worldwide to discuss fast logic portfolio licensing opportunities

8313150 we are obviously pleased with the markets response to our unique approach to licensing
8313151 as weve converted to an all voip communications system with increasingly centralized infrastructure its more critical than ever that our fewer components can reliably handle high call volumes
8313152 interaction sip proxy tm has helped us maximize our system uptime while migrating to this consolidated virtual contact center model version 4 0s new smtp alerts for more effective system monitoring further help us guarantee uptime for our customers which is of paramount importance in the outsourced contact center services industry
8313153 were facing increasing pressure from clients to demonstrate pci compliance in order to protect customer credit and debit card information
8313154 interaction sip proxy tm 4 0s support for srtp and tls security standards will help us satisfy this requirement so we can ensure our clients customer data is protected
8313155 previously our sip proxy could route interactions based on where they were going in the to field but routing based on the source where multiple servers and gateways were involved would mean increasingly complex thus time consuming configurations
8313156 interaction sip proxy tm 4 0s new source based routing simplifies these configurations ultimately resulting in increased operational efficiencies
8313157 with our conversion to the vmware esx platform underway interaction sip proxy tm 4 0s validation is very timely and will enable us to eliminate additional servers for load balancing and redundancy
8313158 not only will this save us money but by reducing power and heating requirements well also minimize our carbon footprint

8313168 based on the number of searches for labor day weekend travel its clear that people still want to escape and have fun but do so in a budget minded way
8313169 both airlines and hotels are offering discounted travel options for this holiday weekend and it appears that travelers are interested in these alternatives new york in particular has experienced above average increases in hotel rates this year but travelers may also be enjoying various travel incentives offered in this market for the holiday weekend
8313170 travelers continue to be diligent when shopping for airline tickets despite the fact that oil prices are moderating and some airlines are conducting fare sales booking early is still a smart decision because the number of flights to a destination is being systemically reduced airline fees add to costs so buying smart is the best defense combining air and hotel is another way to save
8313171 these leases are very important to our future development plans

8313188 we can review the atm configuration flow and exclude all unnecessary states and screens so we dont load them which has saved us time and money
8313189 we can also quickly test how numerous response codes are seen on the atm screen
8313190 its much easier to test new base24 releases and customizations by using fastest to emulate the issuer and acquirer
8313191 were able to conduct a lot of testing that previously required connecting with host banks
8313192 we recently started processing for bank vtb24 with over 1000 atms and used fastress to confirm that our system could handle the increased transaction volume
8313193 paragon software has helped us immensely with our recent migration to the latest version of base24
8313194 we are currently using the software to test mastercard transactions as part of our migration to the banknet interface paragon has provided us with the software training and support to enhance our on line epayment testing

8313198 dr sayre and his team bring tremendous leadership to this effort
8313199 attracting a researcher of dr sayres caliber speaks volumes about the work we have done over the last decade and the pioneering work we will do in the future
8313200 extracting oil from algae to produce a more sustainable biofuel is one of the most promising and exciting areas of biofuels research today
8313201 algae have significant potential as a clean renewable and economical fuel source and because algae are not used as food they are a biofuel source that does not compete with the food supply
8313202 the first generation in biofuels research was using the corn plant to make ethanol the second generation involves using the non food parts of the corn plant to create cellulosic ethanol algal oil which yields much higher energy density while requiring less land and water than other biodiesel represents the third generation
8313203 for enterprise our companys success depends on the availability of vehicles and fuel and both must be acceptable to society thats why we are taking steps now to invest in the future as part of our commitment to sustain our business by addressing the parts of the world we touch with our business
8313204 our annual happiness index each labor day provides a barometer as to how happy american workers are on the job
8313205 this year its encouraging to see that the majority of hourly and salaried employees are still heading to work each day with positive feelings especially in light of the economic roller coaster weve been riding including high gas prices a mortgage crisis and months of overall job losses
8313206 and while many workers are genuinely content at work given todays fiscal climate i am sure there are those who believe that simply having a job is reason enough to be happy
8313207 reports indicate that americans are driving about 5 percent less this summer than they did a year ago but we suspect the reduction in driving may have more to do with optional miles cutting back on vacations and extra trips to run errands etc
8313208 workers may not feel that they have as much flexibility on how they get to work but employers who help to develop carpool programs and even go as far as subsidizing public transportation options will allow more workers to continue to shift their commuting habits for the better
8313209 up until election day many polls will serve as predictive models to name americas next president
8313210 our intent was not to replace those general population polls but to compare how hourly and salaried workers view the presidential hopefuls offering one more data point for pundits to consider no matter how america ultimately votes snagajob com encourages all eligible workers to cast their ballot

8313218 i dont think anybody can tell you when life begins
8313219 over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8313220 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable
8313221 house speaker nancy pelosi misrepresented the history and nature of the authentic teaching of the catholic church against abortion
8313222 diminished the unique evil of abortion as an attack on life itself and the early church closely associated abortion with infanticide in short from the beginning the believing christian community held that abortion was always gravely wrong
8313223 catholics who make excuses for it whether theyre famous or not fool only themselves and abuse the fidelity of those catholics who do sincerely seek to follow the gospel and live their catholic faith
8313224 a new human individual comes into being from the union of sperm and egg at fertilization
8313225 in keeping with this modern understanding the church teaches that from the time of conception fertilization each member of the human species must be given the full respect due to a human person beginning with respect for the fundamental right to life
8313226 as fellow catholics and legislators we wish you pelosi would have made a more honest effort to lay out the authentic position of the church on this core moral issue before attempting to address it with authority
8313227 your subsequent remarks mangle catholic church doctrine regarding the inherent sanctity and dignity of human life therefore we are compelled to refute your error
8313228 to reduce the scandal and consternation caused amongst the faithful by your remarks we necessarily write you to correct the public record and affirm the churchs actual and historical teaching that defends the sanctity of human life

8313295 the perfect ending winning the fa cup carling cup championship and champions league i would take that but two of them would be fine the most important thing is to stay fit keep playing on a high level hopefully be important for your club and at the end it must be possible to win one or two prizes
8313296 of course its a great challenge but were not losing any sleep about it until maybe we come to the semis its important but the main thing is to focus on the first game then you get a champions league game on wednesday then you get saturday league again we play so many games in a year that you cant just focus on one thing but we have loads of professional players here and they all want to win the games especially the big ones its all about winning prizes and enjoying it as much as possible
8313297 playing the semi final in 1998 the fifa world cup against brazil
8313298 thered just been a great atmosphere in the team the whole tournament and to play against brazil in a semi final is great the whole stadium was orange and yellow great colours it was a nice temperature with great anticipation from the whole world with the national team i gave everything and now i can focus solely on helping united hopefully it will prolong my career
8313299 he takes his run and you go for it take whatever youve got and save it
8313300 i really hope we will take our chances against spartak but the most important thing is to play our own game everything else will come to us if that happens
8313301 as far as i am concerned the score is 0 0
8313302 spartak have changed their tactical scheme in the last two games moving to a classic 4 4 2 and the coach there has been replaced so all the players are eager to show any new manager what they can do and we understand that
8313303 pavlyuchenkos absence will not be a big deal he missed the last league match through injury so he wouldnt have started in kyiv anyway
8313304 een groot deel van de bevolking weet niet dat sommige biobrandstoffen kunnen worden gebruikt in elk type dieselmotor

8313306 das gesetz zur bek mpfung der zweckentfremdung von wohnraum soll die kommunen erm chtigen gegen wohnungsleerstand und die umwandlung von wohnungen in b roraum vorzugehen solche eingriffe in den wohnungsmarkt sind dort wo wohnungsmangel herrscht teil des ordnungspolitischen rahmens und damit bestandteil der sozialen marktwirtschaft
8313307 wir m ssen zun chst pr fen in welchen hessischen kommunen der leerstand von wohnraum bzw die umwandlung von wohnraum in b roraum noch ein aktuelles problem darstellt ohne angabe der kommunen f r die das zweckentfremdungsverbot gelten soll bleibt das gesetz jedoch wirkungslos
8313308 der wohnungsmarkt in unseren ballungsr umen kann nicht allein durch planungsrecht und wohnungsbauf rderung in ein gleichgewicht gebracht werden ohne staatlichen eingriff k nnten es sich nur noch wohlhabende leisten in der n he ihres arbeitsplatzes in frankfurt oder wiesbaden zu wohnen planungsrecht und wohnungsbauf rderung werden deshalb immer auch der ordnungspolitischen erg nzung bed rfen zum beispiel durch die in manchen hessischen kommunen geltende 10j hrige k ndigungssperre nach der umwandlung von miet in eigentumswohnungen durch die fehlbelegungsabgabe oder wie hier gefordert durch ein gezielt eingesetztes zweckentfremdungsverbot

8313375 bereits 1995 haben wir beim bayerischen landeskriminalamt die so genannte netzwerkfahndung eingerichtet ihre aufgabe besteht darin in datennetzen zu fahnden um so straftaten oder konkrete gefahrenlagen festzustellen in den letzten jahren hat bayern die polizeiliche internet berwachung intensiviert und die l nder bergreifende koordinierung verbessert

8313382 picking the wrong vice president someone who doesnt excite mccains base
8313383 needs someone who can rally the base because the base is ready to rally after the democratic convention fiasco this week
8313384 we saw the end of the clinton era last night it was bye bye hillary she de linked herself from bill clinton last night did not say proud wife did not refer to her husband as my husband talked about president clinton one time both of them need obama to lose and theyll do whatever they can after they leave denver to see that that happens if obama wins this thing shes frozen out for 2012
8313385 the reality is that this is not the unified party that everybody made it out to be obamas not the great unifier last night hillary mentioned the iraq war one time and that was supposedly unifying this party dont fall for the myth that the democrats are this juggernaut that cant be beaten they are fractured they are undecided they are not excited
8313386 some of the biggest fools lead this party in my lifetime harry reid nancy pelosi howard dean

8313389 it was about rallying the nation around a common cause of earning international respect and admiration for china

8313391 it doesnt matter how we get there as long as we present the right image

8313394 we are very proud to offer the zoologic courses as part of the credentialing process
8313395 the evaluation process of each zoologic course has enabled us to create an academic program and credentialing process currently unavailable elsewhere in the marketplace this investment in the recently debuted certified portfolio manager program provides participating portfolio managers the real world tools they need to remain competitive
8313396 our relationship with pmi signifies zoologics ongoing strategy to work with institutions and associations in furthering the credentials of finance professionals
8313397 whether working with institutions and associations to integrate zoologic courses into credentialing programs or providing continuing education credits approved by accrediting organizations zoologic learning solutions help todays finance professionals stay competitive

8313399 the law and order of the city depends on you marathi policemen my partys fight is against the trampling of marathi language and culture in the state which can benefit even you and your families
8313400 the next time you pick up a baton to hit them or lock them up prior to a beating ask yourselves and your families if what these boys are doing is morally wrong
8313401 these outsiders who have no pride in the state and its culture
8313402 remember your actions would determine whether other youths will come forward to take this struggle forward or not that is all i have to say how you decide to act is left to you
8313403 what it is the same bunch of criminals that are perpetuating imperialist aggression and war with the same devastating consequences directed against the people the war is a war against the people
8313404 people who think that are looking for a way to avoid acknowledging how bad things are so this is an opportunity for them the people who are in the thick of how bad things are dont say that the gap in between the wealthy and the poor living in the united states is greater now than at any time since the depression so the people saying those things must be on that end of being benefited they are not on the end of being stomped on
8313405 its a slogan and if people were just going off the slogan then they were wrong
8313406 its not two parties theyre two sides of a coin

8313410 this agreement in africa is a direct result of carbon jungles international presence and further solidifies the decision to be acquired by carbon jungle
8313411 if kampala city uganda can convert waste to energy with the help of cobal usa it is a wake up call for the rest of the world to match the africans efforts and there is no doubt that carbon jungles marketing efforts will help us acquire more customers
8313412 this is such an exciting project cobal usa not only sees the future they are helping to create the future w2 energys cutting edge technologies fit perfectly with the development expertise of cobal usa
8313413 living systems are intrinsically robust against cells dying or being damaged
8313414 the behaviour of most organs is an emerging feature resulting from the interaction of many cells where no cell is particularly robust or even aware of the whole behaviour
8313415 the starting point in winsoc was to provide mathematical models of biological systems and translate them into algorithms to determine how the sensor nodes should interact with each other
8313416 our indian partners have buried sensors in the terrain with the capability of monitoring the humidity and porosity of the terrain and the acceleration forces
8313417 the sensors are then linked to a satellite which gathers the data and conveys them to the control centre
8313418 the first is related to the monitoring of the earth with a system capable of autonomous decisions
8313419 this is particularly important in remote areas where it is difficult to recharge batteries or replace defective nodes
8313420 we believe that cross fertilisation of ideas from biology to engineering and vice versa can provide substantial benefits to both areas
8313421 we were called at 7 30am after a worker at the recycling centre discovered the body of a newborn baby

8313428 we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution of a movie entitled hari puttar
8313429 warner bros values and protects intellectual property rights however it is our policy not to discuss publicly the details of any ongoing litigation
8313430 since the case is sub judice we cant comment as of now however we registered the hari puttar title in 2005 and its unfortunate that warner has chosen to file a case so close to our films release in my opinion i dont think our title has any similarity or links with harry potter
8313431 when we start on this next one well just bring our demos to practice and well listen to them judge them and start rearranging the parts that need to be rearranged or we just start jamming on what sounds cool
8313432 it seems pointless after 12 years i think people might think they want it but when they actually hear it i dont think theyll want it anymore thats our feeling about it at least slaughter of the soul was a very good album to end with as it would be very hard to top
8313433 it has come to our attention that lead singer and founding member steve reynolds was mistakenly referred to as john reynolds in the liner notes and then as steve reilly in the credits for the album time bomb we sincerely apologize for this oversight
8313434 as to the allegations printed within marco barbieri s liner notes that we didnt have time to contribute to this anthology this is sadly misguided in fact demolition hammer was quite involved in the initial realization of the project but ultimately due to qualitative differences we decided to let our past work with century media speak for itself we are very honored that demolition hammer still has a growing fan base so long after our releases and tours in fact wed like to thank everyone who kept and continues to keep the legacy of this band alive over the years it truly means a lot to us and we cant thank everyone enough
8313435 this administration is committed to bringing new ideas and perspectives to the many boards and commissions which oversee the vast array of functions that are needed to run a city of 60 000 residents
8313436 we know there are many bright committed men women and youth in bristol who have a great deal to contribute to the betterment of our city bristol is rich in diversity but that needs to be reflected more in the makeup of our boards and commissions for a fair representation of bristols needs
8313437 this is the time to become involved there is so much potential to rejuvenate bristol and make it a destination not a pass through

8313443 what drivers dont realize is that ethanol is one third less energy per gallon
8313444 so if i have a gallon of gas sitting here and a gallon of ethanol im going to get more energy out of a gallon of gas than on a gallon of ethanol
8313445 virtually every car on the road runs on e10 just fine with no problems whatsoever
8313446 you can immediately go to 14 billion gallons of ethanol without having to worry about infrastructure concerns like the cars engine or gas pumps or anything like that
8313447 so if you have a non ffv and you pump it into your vehicle youre going to have a very serious large expense in front of you to the tune of thousands of dollars vehicles that dont run on e85 if you do pump it into those vehicles the problem is it will corrode the fuel lines the tank the fuel pump destroy the fuel filter etc
8313448 if you are comparing performance and that kind of stuff e85 is an extremely high performance fuel and thats why the indy racing league runs exclusively on ethanol

8313456 i heard firing in the morning and did not dare to come out i dont know how many are they the army people helped us to vacate the place
8313457 their pricing plans make no sense to me i think the carriers have little or no idea of what people do with mobile broadband
8313458 the rapid growth in mobile broadband and 3g data service adoption has far reaching implications for mnos business models operators have tended to focus almost solely on providing narrowband voice and sms but the composition of their network traffic is changing
8313459 t mobile reported in april 2008 that the volume of data traffic on its network in the uk had exceeded that of voice traffic for the first time in the first quarter of 2008
8313460 mobile broadband pioneers 3 uk and vodafone are likely to announce a similar trend this year 3 uk reported a seven fold increase in the volume of data traffic on its network in the six months to march 2008
8313461 already phone users will be familiar with the network busy sign when they try to place a call at rush hour what we need to know is whether it really is better for the mnos to keep one bbc iplayer viewer going but consequently to prevent 40 phone calls going through
8313462 how long can you survive in this market competing with the wired suppliers if your users really grow at current rates
8313463 they have just done a deal with bt on the 21cn rollout whereby they sign up early and get a good deal for at least three years and will be able to keep up with whatever users do
8313464 mnos need to review their requirements for network capacity immediately in response to this rapid change in traffic composition
8313465 they will need to invest further in their rans as well as the ongoing upgrade to hspa the demand for additional network capacity from reallocation of gsm spectrum the 2 6ghz expansion band and the digital dividend spectrum will be substantial
8313466 mnos will also need to increase their backhaul capacity which is currently the most significant limiting factor in terms of the amount of available bandwidth
8313467 to be honest i doubt if any of them have been able to look that far ahead
8313468 as little as 3 per cent of the capacity for mobile data is actually used theres not the slightest chance we could over sell it
8313469 when they say we cant run out of capacity what they really mean is over the next two years if we grow at twice the rate we think we can well still have spare capacity but they honestly havent looked any further than the next six months
8313470 as well as increasing capacity mnos will need to keep a limit on costs because mobile broadband traffic will be less profitable than traditional voice and sms traffic

8313482 the alliance will continue to protest until our demands are met this government has to resign
8313483 if we leave before this government resigns that means we are defeated
8313484 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and do the coup again
8313485 the bottom line is he has to come to the negotiating table and negotiate with the mdc as representatives of the people of the country to find a way forward
8313486 they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating and that in six months time the government will collapse i do not know when that day will come i wish main opposition leader morgan tsvangirai well on that day

8313507 fought against a bill protecting the right to life of a baby born alive
8313508 a live child born as a result of an abortion shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law
8313509 it did not confer any right or legal status upon any baby not yet born this bill had no legal conflicts with roe v wade born and living survivors of abortion would be unambiguously considered persons medically scientifically empirically they were no different from the many premature babies who are born in american hospitals each year

8313514 four or five months was deemed to be sufficient age for it to be drunk at

8313516 their western aggression barbarism and state sponsored terrorism not only in palestine iraq and afghanistan but also in bosnia and various south american countries have surpassed all records known to human history
8313517 t he de facto power in these nations pakistan and saudi arabia are political islamic movements this makes these leaders ineffective in stopping these nations from being fountainheads of terror
8313518 even in those days aggressive jihads were waged because it was truly commendable for establishing the grandeur of the religion of allah

8313521 90 percent of the funding for kashmir militants is from other countries and islamic organizations like the wamy

8313561 the closure comes following a further deterioration of the situation in the area where the clinic is located
8313562 there has been a notable increase in violence including mortars landing close by the clinic
8313563 it is simply shocking that only 33 percent or less of americans reports having a great deal or quite a lot of trust in 11 of 15 industries measured in the survey
8313564 and these trust levels are 14 percent less than they were last fall when we started taking these measurements this trend should be a call to action for businesses especially in an ailing economy the link between consumer trust and profitability is well established
8313565 i just dont see why she would do that if she didnt have the nerve to back it up
8313566 i do know that its true that if you wanted to reduce crime you could if that were your sole purpose you could abort every black baby in this country and your crime rate would go down
8313567 an impossible ridiculous and morally reprehensible thing to do but your crime rate would go down so these far out these far reaching extensive extrapolations are i think tricky
8313568 the politically correct society it is an amorphous society where the boundaries of acceptable speech are arbitrarily set by the chattering class and unevenly enforced by the sword of character assassination
8313569 i was showing the limitation of one argument by showing the absurdity of another
8313570 well i think is not worth that much it should be something like 10k so its ok if i steal one because in the end theyre stealing our money asking that much for a car

8313572 we need players who can play wide and im sure benitez is looking for that
8313573 when i was playing most teams played with wingers there was myself and peter thompson at liverpool
8313574 i think it wasnt until 1966 when england won the world cup and i was a member of the squad that alf ramsey played three wingers

8313645 anwar does not have as yet a formal leadership role yet as adviser to pkr he successfully created a viable coalition effective enough to deny barisan its two thirds majority in parliament and dislodge it in five states including such major ones as perak penang and selangor it is a testament to his leadership skills that anwar could forge an alliance comprising the dap and pas two parties that represent the polar extremes of political views in malaysia anwar was successful because he builds on their commonalities their yearning for a clean efficient and transparent government one not blighted by cronyism and corruption

8313665 its funny that almost nobody else in the world does fresh hop beers like oregon and washington he said and it took some time to catch on even here because there used to be this disconnect between brewers and growers bert grant was one of the first and we started making hop harvest about six or seven years ago each year a different recipe this year its based on a blue heron recipe from the 1980s only bigger last years was our ipa only bigger
8313666 its taking advantage of the incredible opportunity we have living in the heart of hop country
8313667 other cities such as denver or san diego have lots of breweries but they cant drive for an hour and come back with a trunkful of fresh hops like we can
8313668 these guys are really changing the industry because theyre putting hops back in beer
8313669 their beers may have three times the hop flavor of budweiser
8313670 access to some of the worlds great hops is one of many reasons that oregon is known as beervana
8313671 and fresh hop beers are fun its like a field trip when you were a kid
8313672 you get a day off and get to drive to the fields and meet the people who grow your hops a lot of brewers make a party of it and take beer to trade for hops
8313673 but its nice to make a different beer once in a while
8313674 were not like a brewpub where they can brew a few kegs and if it doesnt turn out its not a huge loss here we brew 150 kegs at a time so its harder to experiment
8313675 its a chance for the brewer to flip off the autopilot and fly manually
8313676 concocting this collaboration beer with two brewing friends continues to be a terrific amount of fun we all plan to put our own unique spin on what is already a great beer after these beers have sufficient time maturing in wood the tasting events will be a kick
8313677 it is an honor to be asked to participate with these two great brewers in this collaboration project it just shows what a great industry we work in where cooperation is often more valued than competition crafting a beer with todd and zac has been a great experience
8313678 ive been thinking about working on a collaboration for sometime now i really wanted to work with a couple of brewers that knew each other and im really glad that matt and zac signed on to try this out these guys have amazing brewing talent and the end result of our collaboration will not only be fun for our customers at our respective breweries but especially fun for folks at the 2008 gabf the chance to try our respective beers under one roof will be great

8313687 we have gotten calls from hay farmers who didnt know that hops are perennials
8313688 we have some major issues we have got to deal with
8313689 for americans accustomed to todays tame scripted political conventions the 1924 democratic convention went down more like a taping of the jerry springer show on one side was new york governor al smith supported by urban catholic voters who favored his efforts to repeal prohibition on the other side was former treasury secretary william mcadoo who drew the rural protestant anti alcohol supporters a contingent that included the ku klux klan a powerful political force at the time the klan had vowed to defeat the catholic smith as politicians on both sides made speeches on the convention floor hooded klansmen standing outside burned a cross and defaced effigies of smith when a group of outraged delegates motioned to officially condemn the klan for their actions the convention plunged into chaos with pro and anti klan delegates shouting each other off the podium and breaking into noisy parades eventually police had to be called in to restore order the klan measure failed by just one vote but that was only a prelude to the nomination fight the delegates voted a record 103 times with neither smith nor mcadoo able to secure a majority after 16 turbulent days both candidates agreed to step aside and the party settled on another nominee former solicitor general john davis

8313710 well be making announcements shortly on the new arrangements for christians show to make sure that we can take it even further to audience success
8313711 what is important is to make sure that whenever we get new people on board or introduce new more demanding programme properties we make sure we give them the production resource they warrant
8313712 thats why im creating a new executive producer post to help me look after some of the new presentation talent well bring in as the brand evolves over the next few months and years
8313713 he is the yardstick by which all producers should be judged
8313714 he has the rare and important qualities you need producing a breakfast show he is dependable reliable enthusiastic energetic and has a twinkle in his eye for mischief
8313715 he has been the fire and brimstone driving what i have done on breakfast radio for along time his hard work ethic is inspirational the times when i have wobbled he has kept me steady

8313721 while riding the course i kept thinking to myself that we must be on the wrong road there is just simply no way a time trial would have this much climbing
8313722 at the reassurance from my coach and much to my delight we were on the right course
8313723 i was then able to trace the entire course from the comfort of my home and find a similar route to train on back in boise
8313724 this capability along with having the elevation profile proved invaluable in my preparation for my gold medal race

8313729 depending upon the time well make the temptation bigger and bigger the idea was to see if anybody would be dumb enough to choose comfort over the only thing that guarantees you to stick in the game which is immunity
8313730 by the time this season is over you can make the case that maybe this is the dumbest team when it comes to idol play

8313734 marcus the doctor from georgia one of the most arrogant guys that weve had on the show he at one point had three people after him and not only women
8313735 you talk about that as a dead end silo while selling end to end business processes
8313736 i dont think it will lead to an increase in demand for siebel
8313737 i expect this is a strategy by oracle to keep its siebel customers from looking outside of the barn
8313738 the entire industry has to get better at making money selling on demand thats what were focused on before we scale the business

8313764 rising economic segregation and economic inequality has the potential to increase political inequality in the united states
8313765 so much reform so little change the persistence of failure in urban schools
8313766 humans frequently invoke an argument that their intuition can result in a better decision than conscious reasoning
8313767 such assertions may rely on subconscious associative learning between subliminal signals present in a given situation and choice outcomes
8313768 we reasoned that if subjects were unable to correctly perceive any difference between the masked cues then they were also unable to build conscious representations of cue outcome associations
8313769 the ventral striatum responded to subliminal cues and to visible outcomes in a manner that closely approximates our computational algorithm expressing reward expected values and prediction errors
8313770 we conclude that even without conscious processing of contextual cues our brain can learn their reward value and use them to provide a bias on decision making
8313771 our findings suggest that increased brain connections during chronic drug use may actually limit behavioral changes associated with drug addiction rather than support them
8313772 relapse or the resumption of active drug taking and drug seeking is very common in drug addicts
8313773 addiction related brain changes and behaviors seem to be hardwired and semipermanent and there are limited treatment options our data suggest that rather than trying to block the process of increasing dendritic spine density we may actually want to look at treatments that try to enhance this process
8313774 this suggests the exciting possibility that mef2 proteins may control expression of key genes that modulate drug related brain changes and behavior
8313775 if we understand which genes are influenced by mef2 we can intervene and try to help the system resist or reverse these sensitization processes
8313776 patients who used statins before an ami and continued to take them after were 16 less likely to die over the next year than those who never used them so even if it appears that the statins failed to prevent your ami it is beneficial to continue taking them and potentially quite harmful to stop
8313777 in the general population the statin discontinuation rate within the first year of prescription is 30 percent thats very high
8313778 because statins are preventative drugs patients may not feel the immediate benefit of taking them and sometimes stop however it looks like this might be quite a dangerous practice after an ami
8313779 although several groups have documented that repeated cocaine exposure increases nac spine density the precise molecular mechanisms that control this process have remained elusive
8313780 moreover the cocaine induced increase in nac spine density has been hypothesized to contribute to the long lasting behavioral sensitization that occurs after repeated cocaine exposure but direct evidence concerning the functional relationship between these two processes is lacking
8313781 taken together our findings implicate mef2 as a key regulator of structural synapse plasticity and sensitized responses to cocaine and suggest that reducing mef2 activity and thereby increasing spine density in the nac may be a compensatory mechanism to limit long lasting maladaptive behavioral responses to cocaine
8313782 a better understanding of the mef2 associated molecular mechanisms that regulate cocaine induced structural and behavioral plasticity could ultimately lead to the development of improved treatments for drug addiction

8313791 this phenomenon is a growing threat to the national security and sovereignty of the us the hundreds of billions of dollars caught up as windfall profit for arab islamic oil barons is soon to be used to buy distressed and foreclosed property from the very americans that the run up in oil has exploited
8313792 if you truly believe a pandemic outbreak is likely there is reason to believe foreign governments and the u s will clamp down and control the supply
8313793 other places in the world may have a lot of money but no amount of money will get you vaccines in the case of a pandemic
8313794 we see no reason to invest additional money of our own into the pandemic vaccine when we can wait for a foreign government that needs this vaccine to put money in

8313805 we need to prevent ukraine becoming involved in a military conflict we dont intend to allow troops which could be used in military action with a third or fourth country to use our territory as a base

8313807 we have no intention to keep peacekeeping forces outside the borders of the two regions forever
8313808 but we will insist on arranging reliable international control over the bordering territories

8313815 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8313816 arizonans are also proud of their political tradition from barry goldwater to mo udall to bruce babbitt theres a pattern here
8313817 speaking for myself and for at least this coming election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue
8313818 nowhere in that speech did she answer the question about his character his ability to lead the things that are at issue here
8313819 and until she does youre going to have a lot of hillary clinton supporters that are either not going to vote or are going to vote for john mccain
8313820 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president
8313821 we have heard from some community residents and some elected officials that they question whether the site they selected is a sound choice
8313822 were partners with the school district and obviously they have concerns as do camelot and the residents and political leaders of rhawnhurst we are in a holding pattern as is everyone else until we can come to some kind of decision
8313823 all sides have valid points i understand the communitys concerns they live there that is their community but 500 kids deserve a right to go to a decent well run school no matter what happened to them before we want to see that happen
8313824 whats happened at the very top of the first round is ridiculous
8313825 when youre paying the guys who have never done anything more than star football players in this league that have played for years and established themselves at this level what theyre capable of it can be a little frustrating

8313830 never in the political process did he obama mention cesar chavez or the plight of farmworkers
8313831 as farmworkers and laborers across america continue to struggle for fair treatment and fair wages we find strength in what cesar chavez accomplished so many years ago and we should honor him for what hes taught us about making america a stronger more just and more prosperous nation thats why i support the call to make cesar chavezs birthday a national holiday its time to recognize the contributions of this american icon to the ongoing efforts to perfect our union

8313836 i know youve been hurt before and you dont want to try no more said you already closed the door to that part of your heart but you can love again in time your heart will mend before its all over youll be doing fine i believe in new beginnings no matter what they say yesterday is over todays a brand new day
8313837 the review will include consideration of hupds diversity training community outreach and recruitment efforts as well as the ways in which harvards past experience as well as best practices elsewhere can help inform our future practice
8313838 the review will provide the department with an invaluable opportunity to benefit from mr martins expertise and to hear in new ways from the harvard community about how we might better serve our diverse population

8313844 we now have in the culture dish cells which have the same genetic makeup as do the als patients and they are the very cells that are affected by the disease
8313845 this provides us with the opportunity to study these motor neurons derived from the als cells
8313846 this opens the door to being able to make patient specific stem cell lines from diseases which affect people very late in life like parkinsons disease or alzheimers disease
8313847 future research is surely going to focus on ways to replace those viruses with chemicals
8313848 and i think well see that in a short amount of time
8313849 we need to compare these cells weve generated to the gold standard cells weve generated from human embryonic stem cells
8313850 until we can do that we wont have complete confidence
8313851 weve only had one woman follow through and go through the considerable effort of donating oocytes egg cells for research i would characterize the number of oocytes she donated as a handful and the results we had from those very few initial experiments were encouraging but theres no sign of additional donors in sight
8313852 our real hope is that very similar events are occurring in these sporadic patients the 90 percent of patients in which the trigger is different
8313853 since the diseases are so similar we believe that many of the mechanisms must be similar or the same
8313854 we are following through on a commitment we made to the community
8313855 the education portal enables us to deepen that connection around education in particular
8313856 i wanted to make sure that undergraduates especially got involved with allstons expansion
8313857 what better way is there to continue building a long lasting relationship than to get our students involved in it
8313858 think of the education portal as a preamble to the future
8313859 at first i was a bit unsure about what exactly i would teach them
8313860 but when i saw that the kids are really interested in all sorts of science it made it easier for me to share my passion in really creative ways
8313861 down the road we will be looking at what may be required to rebuild the georgian military
8313862 right now the mission of the united states military is to provide humanitarian assistance
8313863 though 2007 was the sixth and likely the final year of an economic expansion 4 4 million more americans were poor the median income of non elderly households was 1 100 lower and nearly six million more americans were uninsured than in 2001 even though the economy was in recession that year never before on record has poverty been higher and median income for working age households lower at the end of a multi year economic expansion than at the beginning the new data add to the mounting evidence that the gains from the 2001 2007 expansion were concentrated among high income americans
8313864 we have the biggest gap between the rich and everybody else since the great depression
8313865 output per hour or productivity rose 2 5 percent per year during the 2000 to 2007 cycle compared to 2 percent in the 1990s when family incomes fared much better the economy expanded in the 2000s but that growth clearly failed to reach most households a dynamic that implicates growing income inequality the fact that these disappointing income poverty and earnings trends occurred in the context of strong productivity growth is a reminder that in todays economy productivity growth creates only the potential for higher living standards as long as most workers lack the to claim their share of the growth they have helped to generate that potential will not be realized
8313866 the improvement in health care coverage in 2007 was due to more americans obtaining coverage through government health insurance programs principally medicare and medicaid
8313867 the 12 5 percent rate in 2007 compares to 11 3 percent in 2000 it is unprecedented that poverty is higher at this point in an economic growth cycle and the damage from the failure of the economys growth to lift more people out of poverty is huge if the 2007 poverty rate were just the same as in 2000 approximately six million fewer americans would have lived in poverty in 2007 all signs are that the poverty rate will be driven higher in 2008 by a slowing economy and skyrocketing costs for housing energy and food
8313868 the data for 2007 are of particular concern given that the economy is now in a slowdown and poverty is almost certainly higher now and incomes lower than in 2007
8313869 the 2007 levels are likely to constitute a high water mark for the next few years
8313870 when the data become available for 2008 the picture will undoubtedly grow more grim
8313871 average real weekly earnings are down 2 4 percent so far this year according to the bureau of labor statistics
8313872 we will hear a lot this fall from presidential and congressional candidates about their vision for americas economic future a reinvigorated fight against hunger and poverty must be an essential part of this vision
8313873 prescription medication borrowing and sharing are a concern for womens healthcare providers and public health professionals because of the potential health effects for women and the possibility of teratogenic effects on the developing embryo or fetus
8313874 suggesting that potentially teratogenic medications are available for borrowing and sharing in this population
8313875 the risks of medication sharing should be discussed with patients when a healthcare provider is prescribing a medication that might be of teratogenic or other risk if the medication is used by persons other than those for whom it was prescribed
8313876 women might act as family doctors making them more comfortable in sharing prescriptions or prescribing them for others
8313877 daily multivitamin use might serve as a proxy for following public health recommendations
8313878 future studies are necessary to determine why women believe the reasons provided for medication borrowing or sharing are acceptable so that interventions can be developed to counteract these behaviors
8313879 prescription medication borrowing and sharing among women of reproductive age

8313891 w e face a great new challenge a world energy crisis that threatens our economy our security our climate and our way of life and until we address that energy crisis our problems will only get worse for eight long years the white house has led us in the wrong direction and now senator mccain wants four more years of the same can we afford four more years no is it time for a change yes when do we need it now and who do we need as the next president of the united states of america obama thats right barack obama is the change we need we need to break americas addiction to foreign oil we need a new energy system that is clean green and american made and we need a president who can marshal our nations resources get the job done and deliver the change we need after eight years of a white house waiting hand and foot on big oil john mccain offers more of the same at a time of skyrocketing fuel prices when american families are struggling to keep their gas tanks full john mccain voted 25 times against renewable and alternative energy against clean biofuels against solar power against wind energy this not only hurts americas energy independence it could cost american families more than a hundred thousand jobs at a time when america should be working harder than ever to develop new clean sources john mccain wants more of the same and has taken more than a million dollars in campaign donations from the oil and gas industry now he wants to give the oil companies another 4 billion dollars in tax breaks four billion in tax breaks for big oil thats a lot of change but its not the change we need even leaders in the oil industry know that senator mccain has it wrong we simply cant drill our way to energy independence even if you drilled in all of john mccains backyards including the ones he cant even remember that single answer proposition is a dry well and heres why america consumes 25 percent of the worlds oil but has less than 3 percent of the reserves you dont need a 2 calculator to figure that one out there just isnt enough oil in america on land or offshore to meet americas full energy needs

8313898 the process has speeded up and governments are becoming very serious about negotiating a result
8313899 accra shows that overcoming the muddle of conflicting views and crafting an effective deal to tackle climate change is possible
8313900 those who made the judgment regarded themselves as educated people
8313901 in spite of that they tortured an innocent person and had her executed although it was known to them that the alleged crime was neither doable nor possible and that there was no legal basis for their verdict
8313902 we categorically deny that the sudan liberation movement has carried out the hijacking
8313903 we condemn any act that causes harm to any sudanese civilian
8313904 i always hated japan and ive come to hate it more these days
8313905 i explode with anger whenever they say its their territory
8313906 japans past wrongdoing and its colonial rule are condensed in these tiny islets
8313907 japan is of the view that both sides should respond calmly to this issue recognizing the differences in positions between our countries as differences in positions
8313908 im gonna vote for hillary im a clinton delegate and she hasnt released me yet
8313909 theres no need for it its over its been over we all knew it but some of us havent given up the ghost yet
8313910 i think youll find overwhelming support for sen obama in this delegation
8313911 everyone should have heard her by now loud and clear that the job going forward is to work for the election of obama
8313912 id like to see the entire delegation support obama it would be a very strong signal
8313913 the campaigns have determined how this is going to work
8313914 i understand that the clinton delegates want to serve their constituents that is what im doing but i dont want this to be a hollow victory for obama
8313915 i think its part of the healing process i think after tonights vote were going to be a united party and support obama a divided party will never win
8313916 we know there are delegates loyal to clinton its ok its part of the process
8313917 if we dont have an official roll call vote state by state it is going to reopen a wound
8313918 the more games are accepted by the mainstream the more games writing can change the new york times the phoenix and other mainstream publications arent relying on video game advertising dollars thats why they read differently
8313919 many games writers today are chosen by their love of games and not their love of writing their needs to more attention paid to writing skill and a desire to write well about games
8313920 first we need to establish the possibilities after that we need to let people take the time to appreciate it if enough people do they will demand it
8313921 1 2 years ago id have said we simply need more outlets now id say there are some outlets that try to publish more thoughtful content now we need more outlets but we need more writers than outlets
8313922 as we age the ability of the immune system to fight disease and infections and protect against cancer wears down as a result of the impact of oxygen radicals on the immune system
8313923 our defense against oxidative stress damage may determine at what rate we age how it will manifest and how to interfere in those processes
8313924 this is a radical new way of thinking in how to increase the immune function of elderly people to possibly protect against viral infections and cancer
8313925 we may have uncovered a new mechanism by which to boost vaccine responses by using a nutrient chemical to impact oxidant stress pathways in the immune system

8313927 our findings suggest that increased brain connections during chronic drug use may actually limit behavioral changes associated with drug addiction rather than support them
8313928 relapse or the resumption of active drug taking and drug seeking is very common in drug addicts
8313929 addiction related brain changes and behaviors seem to be hardwired and semipermanent and there are limited treatment options our data suggest that rather than trying to block the process of increasing dendritic spine density we may actually want to look at treatments that try to enhance this process
8313930 this suggests the exciting possibility that mef2 proteins may control expression of key genes that modulate drug related brain changes and behavior
8313931 if we understand which genes are influenced by mef2 we can intervene and try to help the system resist or reverse these sensitization processes
8313932 our findings suggest that increased brain connections during chronic drug use may actually limit behavioral changes associated with drug addiction rather than support them

8313939 on behalf of all the members of the aacr and the cancer research community at large i would like to express our deep appreciation to dr rebbeck for accepting this very important post
8313940 dr rebbeck is a world renowned scientist and epidemiologist lauded for his extraordinary accomplishments in molecular and genetic epidemiology of common cancers
8313941 clearly he is the ideal individual to be the editor in chief of this important peer reviewed journal which is devoted to the publication of the most important studies in cancer causation mechanisms of carcinogenesis prevention and survivorship
8313942 we look forward to working with dr rebbeck to bring the findings published in this journal rapidly to the benefit of cancer patients around the world

8313954 after much speculation i can confirm that gareth barry will not leave aston villa before the transfer window closes
8313955 gareth made the decision to stay two weeks ago and informed aston villa of his intentions
8313956 during this time discussions have taken place to decide the best way forward for all parties
8313957 any talks regarding potential new contracts at aston villa will not take place until the end of the season
8313958 gareth wants to concentrate on playing on the best of his ability for aston villa and we hope this draws a line under the matter

8313972 although a ninja is trained to fight and learn to anticipate the moves of the opponent the bear has these instincts by nature man has to be trained to use the instincts and no amount of training can equal an instinct that is already born into a human being the bear assuming a full grown bear would have a definite size and weight advantage the only thing the ninja would hope to gain is an advantage in speed and agility
8313973 if the ninja had no weapons the bear would win however a ninja that stays nimble and has his kitana and throwing stars would overcome the nasty bear bringing the filthy beast to its final rest

8313990 john mccain says the economy is fundamentally sound john mccain doesnt think 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatize social security and in 2008 he still thinks its ok when women dont earn equal pay for equal work
8313991 now with an agenda like that it makes perfect sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8313992 we have a lot of work ahead of us jobs lost houses gone falling wages rising prices the supreme court in a right wing headlock and our government in partisan gridlock the biggest deficit in our nations history money borrowed from the chinese to buy oil from the saudis putin and georgia iran and iraq
8313993 when barack obama is in the white house hell revitalize our economy defend the working people of america and meet the global challenges of our times
8313994 democrats know how to do this as i recall we did it before with president clinton and the democrats
8313995 and if we do our part well do it again with president obama and the democrats
8313996 if barack obama loses this fall the democrats will be devastated and if hillary clinton is viewed has having contributed to that loss by encouraging and maintaining a rift within the party she will be severely damaged tuesday night she said some of the right words but between now and november hillary clinton can go out and work to heal the wounds or sit back and keep them open
8313997 obviously barack obama will be the nominee im here to show support
8313998 certainly hispanics hold the key to winning the white house so we are very committed to that
8313999 people forget there is a strong bond between texas and hillary clinton

8314009 do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs that it may benefit those who listen and do not grieve the holy spirit of god with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption get rid of all bitterness rage and anger brawling and slander along with every form of malice be kind and compassionate to one another forgiving each other just as in christ god forgave you

8314014 i have as much authority as the pope i just dont have as many people who believe it
8314015 im completely in favor of the separation of church and state my idea is that these two institutions screw us up enough on their own so both of them together is certain death
8314016 think of how stupid the average person is and realize half of them are stupider than that

8314020 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8314021 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8314022 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8314023 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8314024 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8314025 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals
8314026 ongoing investigation and yesterdays action was just the first part
8314027 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs
8314028 i think what we see is a lot of confusion right now im not sure investors really know what to do youve got oil jumping all over the place
8314029 we saw an increase in their confidence in the direction of the overall economy but that was offset by more owners saying theyre having cash flow issues
8314030 their perceptions of the conditions for their own businesses were flat making this gain harder to pin down there is still a great amount of caution out there
8314031 its not that surprising that small business owners are less apt to get involved in the political process
8314032 they are so fiercely independent and hard working that for one they dont have a lot of leftover time or money to donate and two they dont have the lobbying power in
8314033 there have been no reports of serious injuries or property damage and no reports of incidents for any other ipod nano model
8314034 consumer confidence readings suggest that the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year
8314035 overall readings are still quite low by historical standards and it is still too early to tell if the worst is behind us
8314036 over the years the united states has sent many of its fine young men and women into great peril to fight for freedom beyond our borders the only amount of land we have ever asked for in return is enough to bury those that did not return
8314037 have you heard the latest dumb stunt bush has done he has sent an aircraft carrier to indonesia to help the tsunami victims what does he intended to do bomb them
8314038 why is it that we always have to speak english in these conferences rather than speaking french
8314039 maybe its because the brits canadians aussies and americans arranged it so you wouldnt have to speak german
8314040 then you should know enough to have your passport ready
8314041 the last time i was here i didnt have to show it
8314042 impossible americans always have to show your passports on arrival in france
8314043 well when i came ashore at omaha beach on d day in 44 to help liberate this country i couldnt find any frenchmen to show it to

8314069 gt tackles the issue of john mccains yet to be announced running mate and how senator joe lieberman would be an awful choice one of mccains big messages is that he can cross party lines to make things work and that hes the true bipartisan candidate adding lieberman a former democrat turned independent to the ticket would make them a true bipartisan duo and while mccain and likely lieberman would love to run with that novak says lieberman and other republicans know it would never fly mainly because liebermans stances on social issues would alienate a huge segment of the republican party lieberman was reportedly encouraged by a republican in the know to dissuade mccain from choosing him lieberman is a heroic figure among republicans for having risked his senate seat to support president george w bushs war policy but aside from the war he votes the straight liberal line including pro choice on abortion liebermans republican friend told him that the republicans would leave minnesota in a state of disarray with a mccain lieberman ticket alienating social conservatives who now make up the core of republican voters

8314095 i liken this to the demise of the neighborhood corner grocery store same problem the bigger stores take over and you get the supermarkets and the large superstores come in and you have less and less
8314096 i knew where everything was and the people were so friendly and it was a down to earth store
8314097 it would leave managers and supervisors to cover as best we could in those functions

8314101 suddenly hes the champion of a different political party just because he feels bitter about doing so badly in the preselection
8314102 he did badly because he wasnt the sort of person the locals wanted its not like he lost it by one or two votes he lost by a long way
8314103 we are investigating a matter which relates to a police officer and were still investigating
8314104 we had concerns about his behaviour and weve then looked to investigate that matter
8314105 so at the moment were still collecting evidence and well talk with the director of public prosecutions about the way we might go forward
8314106 many officers exercise that discretion in a number of ways
8314107 what we require of our officers when they do that though is that they are open and transparent
8314108 we have a variety of ways we find out about officers behaving badly

8314169 and you know what struck me when i first met barack was that even though he had a funny name even though hed grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine

8314171 how much we share and how alike we really are
8314172 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no you want a persistent president
8314173 im surprised mccain remembers his name half the time hes so old

8314191 my fav from 2nite just think about this in six months we will have an administration that actually believes in science mark warner yes
8314192 warners speech was fantastic we have to fund and tech to save this nation and remain competitive
8314193 think in 4 months we could have a presidency that believes in science

8314199 obviously 02 we ring up second in the championship in xtreme again but that one was right to the very end we were back with the bruce team and we ended up tied in points for the championship with jason pridmore but he won the tiebreaker because he had more wins
8314200 it was just a weird season i could go through race to race and point out everything that happened in every race it was just never even meant to be
8314201 there were way too many oddball incidents throughout that year that you would never expect and it just so happened thats where we ended up in the championship tied but second
8314202 one example is road atlanta myself and ben spies were racing at the front for the lead and jp blows his motor on the back straightaway going into the chicane and he oiled the track the guys behind him were all on a different line so there were no oil flags
8314203 me and spies come down the hill at a buck seventy five and as soon as we sat up and touched the brakes we both went down simultaneously
8314204 watching the replay at full speed it looked like maybe something happened but in slow motion you can definitely see it was two separate incidents
8314205 i picked my bike up out of the gravel and i didnt want to start it because i knew there was gravel in it
8314206 in that hour time frame it worked out great for jp he was able to put a whole new motor in his bike and restart the race
8314207 that was just one incident that season that typifies how that season played out

8314221 i think it provides an opportunity for people who have enough fears going in to perhaps be a little more knowledgeable or a little more comfortable going into it
8314222 the two grants put us really in the limelight and give us the funding to pursue this research over the next five years showcase us as one of the national leaders and then that makes us an attractive place for pharmaceutical companies to bring trials here
8314223 so basically from the front end to the actual implementation of the treatment theres somebody guiding them through the comprehensive management plan
8314224 if lives are lost it wont be hundreds or thousands
8314225 one of the things our government wont tolerate and after 9 11 our citizens wont tolerate is trying to use americans as punching bags or targets for terrorist acts or mindless acts
8314226 the shorts are becoming more bullish and are cashing out
8314227 if the markets continue to improve well see the pace of buying accelerate
8314228 its looking as though their focus is changing away from financials

8314230 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8314231 if john mccain were any closer to big business hed be listed on the new york stock exchange
8314232 a worker who votes for john mccain is like a chicken voting for colonel sanders
8314233 this was an opportunity and a lot of hard work by members of the fire department
8314234 when we build a better community we do it together
8314235 the city is at least two stations behind and there is no current funding source
8314236 we have to look at alternative revenues and its going to be fees and charges
8314237 i feel that we are making a difference in our community

8314247 but one day all of a sudden it just happened
8314248 i knew that something was wrong because i didnt hear anything from him just nothing
8314249 i was just so proud to show off my big old jim mcconaughey and his gift
8314250 i was deciding do i want to have another baby

8314260 this whole thing is starting to sound like a woody allen movie
8314261 i mean how did we get here these girls were selling from a table twice the size of this podium
8314262 i dont want to explain to friends in pennsylvania why my little town is on the news again by golly we should be able to make this work its getting embarrassing
8314263 everyone else here drives by and sees this occasionally but im staring at this mess 24 7 i dont feel like i should have to look at this every time i look outside my window
8314264 this is a residential area its not fair to me

8314267 iran radical islamic government known sponsors of terrorism developing nuclear capabilities to generate power but threatening to eliminate israel
8314268 they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us
8314269 you know iran they spend one 100th of what we spend on the military if iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance
8314270 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8314271 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8314272 arizonans are also proud of their political tradition from barry goldwater to mo udall to bruce babbitt theres a pattern here
8314273 speaking for myself and for at least this coming election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue
8314274 nowhere in that speech did she answer the question about his character his ability to lead the things that are at issue here
8314275 and until she does youre going to have a lot of hillary clinton supporters that are either not going to vote or are going to vote for john mccain
8314276 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president
8314277 while the tape shows part of the story what it cannot show is officer simoes intent
8314278 is another global infrastructure mining and material processing equipment play terex has good earnings and growth with a low p e i like the recent insider purchases
8314279 looking at the parts we are playing im very concerned about what you think of us
8314280 like george im not sure if i should be flattered or insulted
8314281 have you seen the film and you call that a love letter
8314282 we started writing the movie as kind of an exercise thinking of what kind of parts these actors might play what kind of story they might inhabit
8314283 its really a funny script i didnt feel any need to wander off the script
8314284 he doesnt consider any other possibility other than what he thinks will happen i pretty much ran with that
8314285 theres something really really funny in terms of my character being so angry all the time
8314286 im sort of happy to be here it is one of my favorite places
8314287 the stars of the convention should be the people who are being elected
8314288 a partir de 2009 2010 les quatre meilleures quipes de la saison r guli re seront qualifi es pour les phases finales il y aura une grande finale susceptible de ravir les supporteurs et les partenaires financiers
8314289 there are still things we want to do with the african setting and i think its safe to say well continue to explore it that said we might find something new and compelling about the antarctic setting that wants us to make the next game there but honestly were still at the preliminary stages
8314290 its purely a byproduct of gameplay and this notion of a highly destructible environment
8314291 sticking to our ethos of do no harm to the game we tagged the parts in the environment for ads and like everything else in the game they can be destroyed its mirroring what the studio wants out of gameplay and making the most of it if we did anything that wasnt destructible in mercenaries 2 itd be awkward its taking advantage of the full environment
8314292 quite a long time ago to an as yet unannounced development house
8314293 an opportunity for networking that has led to dozens of business meetings and even a few deals
8314294 while the aim was not necessarily to do business i think the casualness and the lack of pretense made us all really close
8314295 from this nationally representative telephone survey we estimate that more than 4 3 million u s adults are taking opioids regularly in any given week
8314296 the extent and characteristics of opioid use among u s adults reflected in this study reinforces the need to strike a rational balance between opioid misuse and effective control of chronic pain
8314297 the project will involve the documentation of all of the thousands of dead sea scrolls fragments belonging to about 900 manuscripts and placing them in an internet databank that will be available to the public
8314298 scores of scroll fragments that were blackened or ostensibly erased over the years and which were not visible to the naked eye until now
8314299 i believe that by using spectral photography we will succeed through non invasive means to determine the amount of water present in the parchment from which the scrolls are made
8314300 data such as this has added value for conservation and preservation issues if for example we discover that the parchments are too dry it will be necessary to modify the conditions in which they are maintained
8314301 conditions are very different from land transport due to the risk of the system getting wet with sea water or being subjected to constant shaking
8314302 the way society tests and evaluates rather than just being a reflection of prevailing theories of intelligence and learning shapes our notions of what intelligence is this is a dangerous trap
8314303 what the policy makers need to really consider once we go to move past this crisis is to possibly implement some type of counter cyclical housing policy make mortgages available in times of crisis and perhaps restrain mortgage credit availability when the market is heating up
8314304 its not raining there are light breezes basically were all in standby
8314305 but my instinct is it will be a really wet night
8314306 they were all members of a family who had taken shelter since tropical storm fay and left to go home because they thought the danger had passed
8314307 solid gains in both overall and core new orders bode well for a return to positive growth for investment spending on equipment and software after a 3 4 per cent drop in the second quarter
8314308 as well the gain in inventories of durable goods is consistent with expectations that overall business inventories will add to gdp growth in q3
8314309 provide some encouraging evidence that price pressures in the eurozones largest economy are beginning to recede
8314310 million dollar question is whether the inflation beast is now really tamed or just taking a short breather
8314311 nearly all depends on the oil price in the months to come
8314312 if the price of oil remains at around its current level in the coming months or even falls further the peak of inflation is likely to be behind us for the time being
8314313 an encouraging sign that petrol and heating oil suppliers are passing the fall in the oil price on to consumers very quickly
8314314 it is much too soon to breath a sigh of relief
8314315 early signs of easing price pressures support our view that the bank ecb will be free to start cutting interest rates early next year
8314316 this is troubling and could indicate additional pressure in future quarters but we await additional details from management
8314317 while the current environment continues to be challenging cibcs franchise is solid
8314318 cibcs capital position is strong and our core businesses are well positioned for better performance and growth as market conditions improve
8314319 as well as by the impact of our ongoing run off activities and the refocusing of our core businesses particularly in cibc world markets
8314320 before the data the energy markets were already up because of the storm and so the eia numbers have not made much of an impact although crude inventories being down was a bit of a surprise
8314321 gustav is headed right toward the centre of the gulf of mexico hurricanes taking this route are usually threatening
8314322 between now and the weekend we could see crude prices encounter a fair measure of support as the uncertain path of the storm generates the usual consternation
8314323 we are not convinced that this crisis will be bullish for the energy markets as any punishment meted out by the west will steer well clear of russias energy sector
8314324 what i expect from opec is to keep pumping at the same level after the increase

8314337 our meetings have been very different from lakeland in style and form the character of our outpouring is been much more just soaking in the presence of god and seeking his face
8314338 we cry out to god and worship and pray for the sick every night but its not lakeland or anything where 10 000 people show up the san francisco bay area has less christians per capita than most missions fields under 3 percent the cry for revival is something that is really burning inside of us
8314339 it was like having sex with a stuffed animal with those fake eyes and fake hair a stuffed animal with a real set of you know what it feels like having sex with an oversize cabbage patch you got silicone parts that are made for toys

8314343 its obviously a new partnership but weve done well so far
8314344 a bit like anything it develops and you get used to running between the wickets and communicating to the point where it will just be a simple nod rather than a call
8314345 things like that do happen over time and given the time i think fingers crossed it could be a good opening partnership
8314346 i dont think you can have defined roles because there are too many variables
8314347 we know what we want to do and we know where we want to be at the end of the powerplays and during the powerplays but on different wickets that might adjust slightly against different bowlers

8314349 there will be days when ian is absolutely on fire and hitting everything for four and there will be days when im clubbing it around a little bit and getting ones and twos and vice versa

8314351 as a batter youve got to have pride in the fact you want to bat youre playing for england youre representing your country and none of us want to go out there and just throw it away
8314352 you have that pride and its something ive worked very hard on to not just give it away but there are risks you have to take
8314353 ive had experience of opening the batting for sussex and if i need a boundary i know what kind of shot i need to play but its trying to make sure you get the level of risk management right
8314354 you want a boundary but its a question of working out which is your best option and to be fair to ian he stands and plays nice shots and gets boundaries

8314412 i think in normal economic times most of these items would pass or have a good chance of passing but i think the real problem now is that people are scared i just saw some numbers that seven out of ten people have a pessimistic view about the u s economy

8314585 while star wars related tickets may not come on a blister card have 19 points of articulation or come with a certificate of authenticity many collectors are beginning to discover the unique appeal of these often discarded scraps of flimsy cardstock which at face value dont seem to offer much a title venue date time and perhaps the price of admission but those five bits of information are also able to connect fans emotionally to the events themselves whether its viewing the sagas latest chapter for the first time touring an exhibit of costumes and props enjoying a symphony of star wars music or attending a star studded fan convention information recorded on ticket stubs also documents some historical facts about the event what time of year it took place how much it cost how long it ran and where it happened for fans that enjoy exploring every historical nuance of the star wars phenomenon these unassuming facts can be gold for new collectors tickets bearing the star wars title in are still extremely affordable since their appeal has not yet been widely recognized this untapped area of star wars collecting has great potential to grow as fans begin to get nostalgic about the events that have defined their star wars experiences over the years in the case of theater admission tickets small town single screen venues are quickly being replaced by megaplexes lending some added historical interest to tickets bearing the names of those classic old movie houses but collecting star wars theatrical tickets is just the beginning star wars has offered all sorts of extracurricular activities throughout the past countless conventions scores of concerts theme park rides and museum exhibits around the world tickets to these events make fascinating mementos for fans to take away and can also be conveniently displayed in frames or scrapbooks
8314586 melbourne is not a theme park city but i do see it as embracing outdoor entertainment theres a strong dining out culture in melbourne and it the wheel fits well into that early evening context
8314587 the tourism market here is quite different you have the highest friends and relatives market with about 20 of tourists here to visit family people love showing off their city to their visitors and the wheel is perfect for that
8314588 think of the difference between a glider and a 747 its very gentle quiet almost a bit surreal you dont even notice you are ascending until you get to the top and start descending

8314595 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life

8314597 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8314598 we know the parameters of the contract and the giants would have been generous
8314599 one or 2 is always pretty much the same thing
8314600 the change i feel is fans are really supporting me and telling me im still no 1 and still the best
8314601 every team can go home and sleep better at night if they know the call was right
8314602 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8314603 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner
8314604 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected

8314609 the word good is like the new bad why settle for even smart when you could instead call your child gifted

8314614 the foundation is in good shape theyre going to be able to build the tower back with steel beginning next week
8314615 i was wary youre talking about a foundation that was put in at the turn of the century but the structural engineers say its good

8314626 they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us
8314627 you know iran they spend one 100th of what we spend on the military if iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance
8314628 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8314629 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8314630 arizonans are also proud of their political tradition from barry goldwater to mo udall to bruce babbitt theres a pattern here
8314631 speaking for myself and for at least this coming election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue
8314632 nowhere in that speech did she answer the question about his character his ability to lead the things that are at issue here
8314633 and until she does youre going to have a lot of hillary clinton supporters that are either not going to vote or are going to vote for john mccain
8314634 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president

8314643 she did her part to make sure we are a democratic team coming out together

8314646 tenir compte avec la plus grande rigueur de lexp rimentation de cette mesure
8314647 la g n ralisation du rsa soit prise en charge par une diminution de la ppe prime pour lemploi
8314648 il y a quand m me plus de l gitimit financer les revenus des plus modestes par une contribution des plus riches sil doit y avoir des financements pour le rsa quils soient pris sur ceux qui ont le plus me para t l gitime
8314649 hier il voulait prendre sur les b n ficiaires de la ppe aujourdhui sur les revenus du patrimoine quand on aura le dispositif je regarderai ce quil y a lieu de faire mais je trouve quil y a quand m me plus de l gitimit financer les revenus des plus modestes par une contribution des plus riches sur le plan du changement de la mobilit et de la capacit renier ses engagements il est le meilleur dentre nous
8314650 une bonne mesure parce quelle vise sortir les gens de lassistance
8314651 dans le montant consid rable des d penses sociales fran aises si nous avions fait le m nage il est probable que nous aurions pu en interne trouver les ressources n cessaires pour le financer
8314652 augmenter les imp ts sur le capital alors quon a baiss il y a un an les droits de succession jai besoin de quelques minutes pour comprendre
8314653 un des engagements de nicolas sarkozy et de toute la majorit cest de revaloriser le pouvoir dachat des fran ais et de remettre ceux qui taient dans lassistanat au travail le rsa pr sente lavantage de contribuer ces deux objectifs
8314654 pas choqu que les fran ais qui ont le plus b n fici de la revalorisation de 5 du pouvoir dachat entre 2002 et 2007 participent en partie au financement de ce dispositif
8314655 cest lassurance de l quit et de la justice car souligne t il il y a deux types de personnes inactives celles qui vivent uniquement de lassistance et qui co tent tr s cher aux fran ais moyens et celles qui vivent exclusivement des revenus financiers ou du patrimoine il faut r quilibrer tout a
8314656 ce nest pas contradictoire avec la promesse de sarkozy de baisser les imp ts puisque les pr l vements obligatoires ont baiss depuis un an d clare t il au point
8314657 lobjectif est videmment de ne pas augmenter la pression fiscale sur les fran ais mais vous ne pouvez pas vous interdire de toucher aux diff rents instruments fiscaux
8314658 la moins mauvaise solution compte tenu des contraintes actuelles car la taxation est limit e certains revenus du capital et un pourcentage faible
8314659 on ne peut pas hurler quand on fait une baisse dimp ts de 11 milliards deuros et critiquer quand on augmente un peu les pr l vements je ne dis pas que je men r jouis pr cise jean fran ois cop lavenir il faudra trouver dautres modes de financement
8314660 une taxe en plus cest des entreprises en difficult voire en d p t de bilan en plus
8314661 et si on se disait quon pouvait faire ce programme sans faire une taxe nouvelle je crois que cest possible vous prenez toutes les d penses que vous avez d j et les ressources financi res que vous avez et vous regardez est ce que je dois maintenir cette d pense l est ce quil ny a pas un tri dabord faire
8314662 la position officielle du pr sident de la r publique
8314663 je ne pense pas que nous soyons r ellement devant une menace de nouvelle guerre froide la russie tait est et restera le dernier pays au monde vouloir une r p tition de la guerre froide une guerre froide au sens ancien du terme est totalement impossible c tait une guerre fond e sur un choc des id ologies
8314664 les forces militaires qui ne se sont pas encore retir es sur les lignes ant rieures au d clenchement des hostilit s doivent faire mouvement sans d lai
8314665 personne ne souhaite en revenir au temps de la guerre froide lotan nest pas un adversaire mais un partenaire de la russie
8314666 pour les europ ens il ne peut y avoir et il ny aura de solution que fond e sur le droit sur un dialogue incluant toutes les parties prenantes enfin sur le respect de la souverainet de lind pendance et de lint grit territoriale de la g orgie dans ses fronti res internationalement reconnues
8314667 nous avons r duit le niveau de nos relations diplomatiques avec la russie nous naurons plus dambassadeur moscou seuls un diplomate confirm et un diplomate de second rang travailleront dans notre ambassade en russie
8314668 il y a la fois le pr c dent du kosovo mais aussi la volont de mettre un coup darr t la multiplication de ces r volutions de couleur leurs fronti res
8314669 la volont de mettre un coup darr t cette mobilisation de lotan qui est per ue comme tr s agressive travers le bouclier antimissile et les nouvelles adh sions en perspective de lukraine et de la g orgie
8314670 il faut prendre en compte cette psychologie la fois de revanche et en m me temps dencerclement de la russie
8314671 nest pas un partenaire secondaire cest un partenaire plein et il faut donc de ce point de vue souvrir un v ritable dialogue renouvel avec la russie
8314672 il faut se battre sur un principe fort qui est celui de lint grit territoriale m me si le kosovo fragilise un peu cette position
8314673 il y a une sp cificit du kosovo qui peut tre d fendue
8314674 le conseil de latlantique nord condamne la d cision de la f d ration de russie de reconna tre les r gions g orgiennes doss tie du sud et dabkhazie et appelle la russie revenir sur sa d cision
8314675 la d cision de la russie viole les nombreuses r solutions du conseil de s curit de lonu quelle a approuv es concernant lint grit territoriale de la g orgie
8314676 ne peut accepter ces violations de tout le droit international
8314677 la russie change de mani re arbitraire et avec violence les fronti res de leurope si leurope se laisse faire une fois la russie recommencera lavenir
8314678 si je quitte la g orgie les russes fermeront notre espace a rien et emp cheront que je revienne au pays
8314679 prenant en compte les souhaits exprim s librement par les peuples doss tie et dabkhazie et sur la base des principes de la charte des nations unies et dautres documents de droit international
8314680 na pas t prise la l g re ni sans pleine consid ration de ses cons quences
8314681 les forces de maintien de la paix russes ont prot g e de lembrasement
8314682 nous vous informons que la f d ration de russie se trouve face la n cessit de prendre la d cision difficile mais lunique possibilit dans ces conditions de reconna tre lind pendance de loss tie du sud et de labkhazie nous comptons sur votre compr hension et votre soutien
8314683 risque de se retrouver dans une position disolement tr s dangereuse si aucun autre tat ne soutient lind pendance de labkhazie et de loss tie
8314684 la russie a r ussi ces derni res ann es nouer des contacts par exemple avec le monde arabe il nest pas exclu que la turquie liran la syrie ou la jordanie soutiennent la russie en loccurrence mais ce nest pas certain
8314685 de nombreuses r gions de russie disposent pr sent dun nouvel argument en faveur de leur ind pendance et il faut tre clair l dessus ainsi la stabilisation du caucase pourrait pr sent prendre une tout autre tournure
8314686 le choix dune strat gie de confrontation avec le monde ext rieur ne provoque larr t de toutes les r formes lint rieur du pays aussi dactualit soient elles
8314687 la reconnaissance de lind pendance de labkhazie et de loss tie du sud est une bombe plac e sous les relations russie occident
8314688 la russie a chass pendant des ann es les georgiens de ces deux provinces par centaines de milliers donc le referendum est bidon
8314689 se sont rendus ils se sont livr s sans violences et les membres de l quipage de lavion sont sains et saufs
8314690 les services de laviation civile ont donn leur accord pour latterrissage de lavion koufra pour des consid rations humanitaires apr s que le pilote eut signal quil tait court de carburant
8314691 pas encore une bonne id e de lappartenance des pirates
8314692 ils ont dit au pilote quils appartiennent larm e de lib ration du soudan sla mais nous ne pouvons pas le confirmer pour le moment
8314693 nous d mentons cat goriquement la responsabilit du mouvement dans cette op ration de d tournement nous nacceptons en aucun cas de mettre en p ril la vie de civils soudanais
8314694 cest un vrai chef de la r bellion de la r sistance du darfour qui dit quil ne conna t pas ces gens et quil refuse absolument demployer ces m thodes cest plut t un homme pacifique

8315054 i wouldnt have planned a better summer i really couldnt have
8315055 i like to stay in contact with schools that stay in contact with me the most
8315056 if i know a school is calling a lot or sending me mail then i will try my best to get back with them as soon as possible because i know that they are interest

8315060 when i go on these visits i think im going to be really comfortable with the players i think ill really know once i go to these schools on where i want to go
8315061 location isnt really a big factor because ive been in north carolina for a long long time

8315211 ugh i have a computer class to get through ill see you right here when class is over
8315212 please allow me to introduce myself i am a man of hunger and lust
8315213 what is it about me you find interesting you are so annoying and why are you talking to me
8315214 its how i like it its how i feel complete when nothings left will you still love me baby cakes
8315215 i left you a present you need it because i cant use it anymore dont worries i left it in a place you can find
8315216 i have bad eyes bad as in i saw how i was going to die gray haired and worthless in a room and i didnt like it not one bit
8315217 then you looked me directly in the eyes and i saw how you were going to die one way or another you were going to find a way on this bus and isnt it always easier to go when you have had a bad day
8315218 i mean if this was heaven why would we die so unhappy because its perfect already you will when its your time i just manipulated things and screwed up your little world so i could die in your peaceful little way class is over
8315219 its probably no coincidence that many languages around the world have repetitious syllables in their child words baby and daddy in english papa in italian and tata grandpa in hungarian for example
8315220 the language centre of most right handed adults is located on the left side of the brain
8315221 this is consistent with our finding with new born babies and supports our belief humans are born with abilities that allow us to perceive and learn our mother tongue systematically and efficiently
8315222 the brain areas that are responsible for language in an adult do not learn how to process language during development but rather they are specialized at least in part to process language from the start
8315223 i am addressing this appeal to those who have not yet been touched dont wait for a member of your family to be lost to be interested in passing the bill
8315224 this phenomenon has been undefined unchecked and it goes on within a culture of impunity precisely because those who perpetrate this act go unpunished and for them to be punished we need a law to do that
8315225 you cannot imagine the pain the torture the sufferings that a member of a family undergoes while the missing loved ones remains to be missing
8315226 if you want us to go to the streets we will go to the streets if you want us to knock on malaca angs gate we will do that we are not afraid of bullets we are not afraid of one woman or her minions what we will do we will do if we do not get the benefits of this bill now at least in the future let disappearance be a part of the past sana nga matapos na ang disappearances
8315227 but up to now it is still on the stage of being researched and still in the committee and not yet been heard even if we do all that we can within our power it will come to naught if there is no bill that would penalize the perpetrators
8315228 pero dahil walang penalty walang mapaparusahan makakasuhan kinakailangang mag enact ng batas
8315229 magiging deterrent magpipigil doon sa mga gumagawa nito ngayon madadagdagan ang responsibilidad ng law enforcement agencies na imbistigahan hulihin at i prosecute ang may kagagawan ng enforced disappearance habang walang batas libreng gawin ng mga gumagawa at walang magagawa din ang mga police agencies
8315230 we firmly believe that this bill is long overdue the passage of hb 2263 and its eventual enactment into law is urgently necessary to finally criminalize the act of enforced disappearance as it is the responsibility of the state to protect its people from such violation and help the victims it should pass this bill into law
8315231 we do not have any illusion that the passage of this bill will finally eradicate enforced disappearances especially under this current regime but we want the perpetrators to be punished in the fullest term
8315232 by putting up the exhibit we want to bring more attention to the phenomenon of disappearance
8315233 finally the loved ones of some of the disappeared were able to come out with their paintings and artworks
8315234 i know it that it was difficult some of the artists are my own children a very dear relative of jonas also has her works here and they said it was difficult to paint pain
8315235 but i say where there is pain there is always hope and when there is pain there is happiness i am sure we will all cheer the moment we hear the house bill 2263 has been passed
8315236 we are excited to expand our relationship with fishbowl in pursuing online ordering by adding online ordering to our existing fishbowl e mail program our big yellow cup club we are streamlining our digital marketing strategy after a pilot run in a few key stores we will evaluate rolling it out nationally in the coming months

8315241 a branch of economics that studies the creation and distribution of wealth related to the technological changes brought by nano technology
8315242 as per the government directive february 2006 for long term leases for 99 years the lessee should pay 95 per cent of the market value of the land at one time premium on commencement of the lease and pay annual rent at the rate of 0 3 per cent of the market value of the land
8315243 i know kara and she speaks her mind so she will be speaking her mind
8315244 i signed decrees on the recognition by the russian federation of south ossetias and abkhazias independence russia calls on other states to follow its example this is not an easy choice to make but it represents the only possibility to save human lives
8315245 the concept of independent scientific review has been in practice since the 18th century and is crucial to ensuring that ideas and proposed work are scientifically sound
8315246 this overhaul of the endangered species act would place the fate of rare species in the hands of government stakeholders who are not qualified to assess the environmental impacts of their activities
8315247 what if we allowed pharmaceutical companies to approve and distribute drugs without consulting the food and drug administration
8315248 the result would spell potential disaster for humans in this case the vulnerable party is our environment
8315249 although we have a significant armament of therapeutic agents against hiv factors that dictate the pharmacokinetics of anti hiv drugs need to be accounted for in order to have haart efficacy in sequestered viral reservoirs several p gp inhibitors are currently under clinical trial however very little is being done to target the mrp transporters our studies using the anti hiv drugs saquinavir and zidovudine clearly implicated that inhibition of mrps rather than p gp would be a more beneficial approach to facilitate the entry of haart drugs into the sub endothelial reservoirs of hiv especially within the brain unpublished findings from our laboratory suggest that similar to mk 571 other leukotriene receptor antagonists e g montelukast singulairtm and zafirlukast accolatetm can suppress mrp mediated efflux of these anti hiv drugs as well we believe that adjunct therapy with these clinically approved mrp inhibitors may improve haart efficacy in hiv positive patients deter the selection of drug resistance and delay the progression of aids
8315250 this study by dr mondal and colleagues has crucial implications in the persistence of sub endothelial hiv reservoirs and will be important to the development of future therapies
8315251 species invasions and extinction the future of native biodiversity on islands
8315252 the presumption at the time was that we are driving biodiversity to lower levels
8315253 certainly if you think about it at the global level this is true because humans have done a lot of things that have driven species extinct
8315254 what dov and i worked on a few years ago is the fact that the vast majority of introductions of species dont have large negative effects
8315255 indeed most species that get introduced dont have much effect at all it doesnt mean that theyre not altering the ecosystem but theyre not driving things extinct like some of the big poster child stories weve been hearing about
8315256 the dramatic increase in the number of species has changed how the system functions
8315257 changing the abundance of natives versus exotics affects all of the other species that used to depend on the natives for food or shelter so its not in any way to say that increasing biodiversity is a good thing
8315258 that by going in and mucking up the system we may have already created the setting where too many species have been packed in and we just havent waited long enough to see these extinctions start to happen
8315259 the whole point of this study was to start looking down the path to see which of these wildly different scenarios might be right
8315260 we havent nailed the answer yet but weve set the stage for answering whether islands are now saturated or not
8315261 it was very surprising to find such a strong correlation between the number of native and exotic plant species on islands around the world
8315262 in ecological research a strong correlation often explains 50 percent of the variation here the correlation between native and exotics explains almost 100 percent of the variation in other words if you know how many native plants are on an oceanic island then you can predict almost perfectly how many exotic plants are there
8315263 which means islands that are far enough away from a continent that theyre not getting regular exchanges with the mainland
8315264 we are at war now and need to make some tough decisions oil independence underlies so many of these issues
8315265 if you look at both platforms most of the big issues on the environment are quite similar
8315266 my feeling is that john mccain will be able to leverage more republicans if we have a democratic senate and house the republicans will be less likely to help move policy
8315267 a president cannot make energy policy without congress he doesnt have the power to do it

8315272 we plan to evaluate a group of women with lam who are experiencing shortness of breath for the presence of pulmonary hypertension
8315273 we will look at participants medical history pulmonary function tests exercise tolerance echocardiogram results and previous biopsy samples
8315274 we are hopeful this information will increase our understanding of how lam can manifest in the patients it affects in the future this information may be useful in developing better management strategies for this disease
8315275 some participants will be seen once in clinic and undergo testing with an echocardiogram while participating in this study
8315276 the individuals who have already undergone a clinical pulmonary hypertension evaluation may be able to participate through a review of select medical records and lung biopsy specimens
8315277 this is not a way to behave to bring peace and stability to that region

8315280 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war
8315281 we dont want one he has a big responsibility not to start one
8315282 not too often i didnt want to push my luck on a lot of things
8315283 but sometimes i just had to get on the field
8315284 but dealing with these type of guys they understand the commitment they understand that work needs to be done and thats what separates these guys is theyll have the discipline to do it
8315285 i tried to find some trees but that didnt really work out
8315286 im responsible enough and dedicated enough that i knew i was going to figure out a way to do it
8315287 even if i had to pick up one of the other people on my back and do squats i was going to do something
8315288 i always thought when our guys go on operations air force it can be as complicated as you want it to be or what you can do is internally you can develop a pretty strong sense of discipline thats going to help you as a competitor
8315289 youve got to have that fiber that internal will that strength thats got to be an edge at the

8315292 whats happened has happened theres no use crying about it
8315293 well go there next weekend i love that circuit id love to race there all year long
8315294 its the best of them all and i hope to have a good car there ill do my best to win there once again
8315295 if anyone doubts my motivation they can be sure of this i want to win now more than ever
8315296 it does seem that the street circuits havent been favourable to me in four races ive only claimed one point in melbourne in a race i didnt manage to finish because of an engine failure
8315297 then there was the incident with adrian sutil in monaco and hamilton crashing into me at the exit to the pit lane in montreal
8315298 the truth is in a couple of races hungary and germany i made some mistakes that relegated me to sixth place while in valencia i missed out on third place by a hairs breadth

8315300 oil markets are keeping a nervous eye on gustav with forecasts showing it may move into the gulf of mexico
8315301 an israeli national was abducted in the city yesterday tuesday we are still checking the details of the incident
8315302 the hijackers surrendered without any violence and the crew are safe and sound
8315303 the night was terrifying and difficult i thank the libyan authorities for their efforts which allowed us to be freed
8315304 the hijackers claim to have coordinated with him nur to join him in paris
8315305 we dont have any relation with that hijacking civilians theyre angry theyll behave like that they may agree with abdul wahid but in our structure we have no decision like this to hijack a civilian airplane
8315306 any queries relating to the legitimacy of the film are unfounded and that due process has been followed throughout the production
8315307 mr mcgartland was consulted by the filmmakers during the production read the script and watched the film in advance of any public screening he was also given the opportunity to have the name of the lead character replaced with a fictional character name which he declined
8315308 conditions are very different from land transport due to the risk of the system getting wet with sea water or being subjected to constant shaking
8315309 but a good effort some of those guys were confident others had a decent voice but gibran matched my style more than the others so it had to be him
8315310 i did doorie but afterwards i wanted to do my kind of music meri kahani is just that it is an album that is filled with personal reflections i got overload guys involved because i love their music especially the pappu saeen bit and it was fantastic working with all of them
8315311 a commercial album has the power to hit the masses to me making commercial music is a bigger challenge than anything else if im singing songs that i dont really believe in and are not challenging me as a musician and they become a hit that to me is an achievement
8315312 that wasnt the only thing when i began i wasnt accepted back when i was starting out noori was huge i went to ali noor and made him hear aadat and he thought it was crap i was very discouraged gumby then said to me that the songs good i would go to channels and they would be in a blackmailing mode if one channel was airing a video another wouldnt
8315313 there have been times when i have sung tunes that im not too crazy about sometimes directors listen to me and sometimes they simply say no to my ideas like race for instance i never wanted to sing meri bahon mein aa i wanted those words to be changed but i was told no so i tried to sing it a little differently the reason i go for bollywood projects is simply because they help in capturing a wider audience
8315314 i never knew that i hope that such things dont happen again
8315315 as far as my image goes i think shabaz has done a great job they were some mistakes he has made some blunders but now he knows exactly what i want what looks good so im pretty happy with that
8315316 he has straightened out a lot of people shahbaz has created a market for atif making sure that i perform at royal albert hall in uk at such an early stage of my career shows in norway and belgium that isnt an easy task he plays a bad guy but it doesnt mean he is we always take money in advance i dont play for free and i dont do favours why should i charge any less this is my money and shabaz has made sure that these rules get implemented and im not taken for a ride
8315317 i still try to do shows in pakistan and not just the three main cities islamabad but others as well recently i have performed at multan sialkot faisalabad and sargodha nowadays schools and colleges are also facing threats so they arent doing many live concerts the change we need is decent sound engineers lighting if a show is sounding great on the ground it shows sound great on television as well but it us who have to push for that change i really think its a lame excuse to use for not doing shows look at india they have made films like raja hindustani but make a film like black today
8315318 in this industry i dont find time for myself and my god the industry is bad the people part and the business part it is seductive and completely attractive but i fight that part i dont fear losing the success and the money that comes with being a star what i do fear is losing my originality
8315319 i know people who are threatened by me i know who they are and i have heard and seen them bitch me out but it doesnt frighten me it makes me happy because it is a telling sign of my own significance within this industry
8315320 voters are saying that almost anything is better than the status quo
8315321 the addition of the 4 700 bushel per hour dryer offers a total drying capacity of 6 700 bushels per hour at the united cooperative feed and grain location in sauk city
8315322 this is an exciting step for our state of the art feed mill in sauk city
8315323 currently a feed mill employee has to spend about four hours per day hauling grain from the existing grain bins over to the feed mill for use in animal feed rations
8315324 this new equipment will free up that time for other work and offer greater convenience for serving customers in sauk city prairie du sac lodi reedsburg loganville and surrounding areas

8315335 los clubes entonces deber an comprometerse a dar permiso a sus jugadores sin que los juegos ol mpicos se incluyan en el calendario internacional de f tbol

8315397 dmitry medvedev the first russian president to become a politician after the cold war has driven the last nail in the coffin of the system that has long become ineffective and inadequate and has more than once led the international community into a dead end
8315398 when the west gets over its emotional reaction to moscows decision many will sigh with relief there because they will see that dmitry medvedev has untied their hands and actually made the decisive move toward a new world order
8315399 this offers russia and the west new opportunities the main thing now is not to become too involved with foreign policy maneuvering and attempts to punish each other or else the sides will miss this rare strategic opportunity to change the world to ones liking
8315400 the format of our missions there still has to be defined
8315401 any plans to accede to russia can only harm russia now because it would then look like annexation so we wont be discussing a reunion of north and south ossetia any time soon
8315402 we have come to russia to stay russia ranked second in europe in gm sales in the first quarter of the year and we expect to become number one in the second half
8315403 i didnt feel any tension on the contrary all our plans aim at developing business and expanding in the country the parent company has even chided us for not developing in russia fast enough
8315404 finland is closely connected to russia geopolitically and economically and depends on its energy supplies
8315405 using this instrument we will receive russian gas in the countrys north and transfer it to gazprom in the south
8315406 cuts in american imports will only improve the quality of food on our counters which will be wholesome and environmentally sound

8315409 the current focus of the new government is to relax regulations and rebuild the nation
8315410 people voted for the nations second power transition because they expected the new administration to correct what the previous administration did wrong and rebuild the publics trust in the government
8315411 the government had already made up its mind before the meeting even took place the township people may protest again
8315412 there is a certain time constraint for this facility to be built and its delay may affect the nations industrial safety
8315413 with the first nuclear power plant on the left and the second nuclear power plant on the right no township in the world has shittier luck than jinshan the eia committee are experts in their field and would know about any potential harm better than we do
8315414 the jinshan area lies on a fault that has the potential for earthquakes measuring seven on the richter scale which could be catastrophic if radioactive waste is stored there
8315415 i plead with the eia members to carefully consider the case if taipower employees or eia committee members will live in jinshan and prove that the spent fuel is safe i will have no more to say
8315416 in 1995 taipower proposed that a spent fuel pool be built for 2 470 sets of spent fuel rods however in 1998 the aec without any environmental impact difference analysis gave the company the go ahead to alter the pool so that it would accommodate more rods as such the pool now contains more than 2 500 rods who knows what kind of impact the increase would have on the environment
8315417 there should be checks and balances while township residents express a lot of feelings taipower is offering cold facts a group of experts who both sides trust should be formed
8315418 i hope that taiwan will be upgraded to a tier 1 country because of these efforts to combat human trafficking

8315432 in all the best sense she has embodied many of margaret sangers qualities gloria is a great visionary but at the same time she is very focused on understanding the increments in which you have to realize a vision
8315433 gloria is a practical visionary and they dont come along very often

8315435 that we really could change the direction of the organizations future

8315440 save your lives and reach relief camps and other safe places there is very little time to escape the death and destruction
8315441 and each generation needs to explore the history of the past to understand fully the context in which these polar extremes come into clashes with one another so history of how we dealt with these problems in the 1940s and 1950s is a current history and a history that is very important for us to understand
8315442 the families have accepted compensation payments they have to accept the money because the police can be very terrifying
8315443 when they accept the money they are told to keep quiet we have all been told not to accept interviews with the media
8315444 it is not convenient for me to speak to you now please dont call
8315445 it is clear that poor construction was a problem why didnt other buildings here collapse
8315446 we have to be thankful to the media for their concern
8315447 because of the reports the situation here has ended much better than it would have otherwise
8315448 who is going to rescue the horses from the horse rescuers
8315449 i notified county animal control about the situation in case we have to decide which horses are adoptable and which ones are not
8315450 people think our place and the one in antelope valley are one and the same
8315451 its a real mess distrust and anger are thick as mosquitoes
8315452 ive gotten calls at my office from people confusing the two sanctuaries
8315453 i tell them i can guarantee that barbaras sanctuary is a good one
8315454 we found horses with open wounds and sores on their legs
8315455 we started getting threats on the telephone from people accusing
8315456 yes there are still racists out there but they are poor stupid and powerless
8315457 this is the first time all 27 buddhist orders have held a rally
8315458 this government is trying to evangelize the whole country and turn it into a protestant state
8315459 but lee must know he is not president only for protestants but for buddhists and catholics too and nonbelievers as well
8315460 if i was living by myself i would seriously consider moving
8315461 when neighborhoods have seen a long stretch of relatively low crime of course new crimes catch their attention
8315462 the impact of a crime like that someone who targets the elderly is that it can create hysteria at times
8315463 is there a concern and fear in the community yes is there some legitimacy to it absolutely is it a crime wave that should cause people to uproot and move out of the west los angeles area no
8315464 as crime crops up what were doing is identifying every area where the crime is and where we dont have a neighborhood watch and then setting those up in that area
8315465 the more people you have out on the streets the more eyes you have watching
8315466 public safety is not just crime statistics its also a feeling
8315467 always worth giving credit where its due was at a restaurant in nyc with a friend called tabla bread bar as pretentious as it sounds and
8315468 its almost like hes a quasi mythical figure its blurring into lore
8315469 mafkidsclub com is a true collaborative effort between bitstudio games and smart kids publishing the my animal family book and dvd series will be a fun and educational experience for kids the website weve developed increases the fun factor while maintaining a common theme with the book and dvd
8315470 i want to do my part and offer an alternative to those who have turned away from the grand coalition
8315471 haider doesnt want a place in parliament hes looking for a stage for a couple of months
8315472 in march 2009 he wants to be re elected as carinthian governor and so any performance is welcome
8315473 we take this issue extremely seriously and are working to resolve this regrettable loss with graphic data as a matter of urgency
8315474 i was appalled when i found the bank account information that sort of thing shouldnt have been listed on there
8315475 it would have been possibly quite easy to find if you know something about computers
8315476 we are now investigating this potential data breach and will be seeking an urgent explanation from graphic data to establish what has gone wrong and the steps that are being taken to prevent a similar incident occurring
8315477 the it equipment that appeared on ebay was neither planned nor instructed by the company to be disposed
8315478 this incident is extremely regrettable and were taking every possible step to retrieve the data and ensure this is an isolated incident
8315479 we have not seen the listing ourselves but we do recommend people wipe hard discs before they sell computers
8315480 we would not allow someone to openly sell bank details on our site but this seems to have been a genuine mistake
8315481 the two hijackers were transported to one of the halls at kufrah airport after giving themselves up
8315482 we categorically deny the responsibility of our movement in this hijacking operation
8315483 we are condemning first the hijacking of a civilian airplane and we are now in continuous contact and consultation with the libyan authorities in kufra airport
8315484 is a true leader of a rebellion of the resistance in darfur who says that he does not know these people and that he absolutely refuses to use these methods
8315485 if they want relations to worsen they will get it
8315486 the most important thing is to defend the rights of the people who live in south ossetia and abkhazia
8315487 break the georgian state undermine the fundamental values of georgia and to wipe georgia from the map
8315488 this is the first attempt in europe after nazi germany and the stalinist soviet union to put a neighboring state on its knees and to change the borders of europe by force
8315489 support peace and stability in abkhazia and in the republics territorial waters
8315490 our tasks include the control of abkhazias territorial waters and the prevention of arms shipments
8315491 even passers by recognise her face and cant help noticing her
8315492 she is quite nervous right now because she never experienced this much attention
8315493 i saw burned bodies wounded people and small pools of blood
8315494 today i was so happy to get a job at last to feed my wife and two kids
8315495 i used to work as day laborer in construction but theres no construction in the area and its hard to find work
8315496 we will not abandon our work if we do so we will abandon our honor as well because al qaeda would take full control over our area
8315497 n o poss vel que ainda n o se entenda que o brasil precisa fazer uma reforma pol tica para dar legitimidade aos partidos pol ticos uma reforma pol tica que acabe com essa hist ria de pol ticos viverem correndo atr s de empres rios e mais empres rios para financiar

8315503 the cyclical upswing in commodity prices from the low in october 2001 at 226 8 per cent is now virtually on par with the huge 235 1 per cent advance in the 1970s in the aftermath of the arab oil embargo
8315504 the strength of this upswing is a testimony to the remarkable growth of emerging market demand this decade in the face of significant supply constraints in many resource sectors
8315505 buoyed by very low visible exchange stocks and supply disruptions likely totalling about 750 000 tonnes in 2008
8315506 ms jagger expressly said she had lost the ring and that this wasnt a theft
8315507 and investors have the right to know all the associated risks
8315508 she is not physically capable of having committed those acts
8315509 were struggling to find a place where she can be kept under lock and key
8315510 we would not be surprised if management guided down earnings expectations given the anticipation of sales pressure through the third quarter and into the very important christmas selling season

8315515 we feel that it is a wake up call to companies that have websites that are selling goods and services
8315516 they need to pay attention to accessibility it is the right thing to do
8315517 as the companys online business has evolved we have made significant enhancements in order to provide an accessible shopping experience
8315518 that is why this is our first priority to see if we can have something under our control
8315519 this has been something that we have been waiting for
8315520 i actually have been concerned about how long this took
8315521 there is no safety issue at all its an efficiency issue
8315522 we are investigating what the problem was and in the meantime were managing the system and working with the airlines to make sure everything works as efficiently as we can have it work at this time
8315523 it appears to be an internal software processing problem were going to have to do some forensics on it
8315524 generally its carriers that use bgp and the issue is really about strictly managing the bgp set
8315525 ideally isps should only allow authenticated servers to propagate changes but that means everyone in the trust chain would have to participate the easiest mitigation is that isps monitor their address space and monitor who is peering with bgp through blacklists and whitelists

8315528 some hillary supporters apparently are either going to not vote or vote for mccain which is pretty much the definition of cutting off your nose to spite your face
8315529 with the limited amount of capital that the company has we thought this was the best use of 255 million that we could have ever done

8315539 this is the same gang there are an awful lot of connections between the two
8315540 the plane tickets were booked at the same north london travel agents and by a man using the same name and with the same credit card
8315541 this gang circles around potential couriers sizing them up these three girls could be the tip of the iceberg
8315542 although plane tickets have been bought inoculations organized and hotel accommodation in west africa arranged the three mules were only asked to return with a package because they do not explicitly mention class a drugs the authorities are finding it difficult to prove a conspiracy
8315543 they buy them things and offer them holidays hairdos clothes and nights out what girl wouldnt want that
8315544 but theres a price theres always a price to pay these people can send 10 girls out there at a cost of 20 000 if one gets through they make more than 100 000 profit
8315545 he took her to another hotel where he was staying and said to her if you want to get back to england you will be taking this weed with you and youll get 1 000 that was the only way she was going to get back he told her

8315547 what is the history of sensibilities on cultural histories old and new
8315548 modes of perception and feeling the terms and forms in which objects were conceived experienced and represented in the past
8315549 a concept that lets us dig beneath the social actions and apparent content of sources to the ground upon which those sources stand the emotional intellectual aesthetic and moral dispositions of the persons who created them
8315550 the idea of a history of sensibilities finds culture to be the condition of being and action rather than primarily an instrument or object of action
8315551 as a part of china taiwan is not a sovereign state the claim by a very few countries that specialized agencies should allow the taiwan region to participate in their activities under the principle of universality is unfounded
8315552 the mainland and the taiwan region are not yet reunited
8315553 but the fact that the two sides belong to one and the same china has never changed
8315554 the principle of respecting state sovereignty and territorial integrity and non interference in other countries internal affairs
8315555 on the basis of the one china principle the chinese government reaches with the secretariat of the who a mou which provides facilitation to medical experts of the taiwan region in their participation in who technical conferences and activities the taiwan region has unfettered access to health and medical information of the who

8315557 a concert of this nature is not conducive to teaching the younger generation to become good citizens upright and competitive but instead would weaken them morally and mentally

8315660 the hijackers surrendered without any violence and the crew are safe and sound
8315661 the night was terrifying and difficult i thank the libyan authorities for their efforts which allowed us to be freed
8315662 the hijackers claim to have coordinated with him nur to join him in paris
8315663 we dont have any relation with that hijacking civilians theyre angry theyll behave like that they may agree with abdul wahid but in our structure we have no decision like this to hijack a civilian airplane

8315678 what i did it doesnt serve any practical purpose its a huge waste of time
8315679 im still in school i want to do important things with my life
8315680 i didnt but then i started getting all these emails from people who were like i hadnt even thought of doing this im going to quit my job and go traveling around the world
8315681 it may not be good art it may not be important art but yeah its art
8315682 both know how the system works and how to break it
8315683 if theres a problem someones gonna want to solve it
8315684 that we do not escape into virtual worlds where we are just trying to be somebody else i hope we use it for being more honest about who we are
8315685 if we get a chance to help make an impact on a kids life thats why were here
8315686 hes never played a fundraising event this was going to be his first one ever
8315687 i think that speaks to the amount of respect he has for our friendship weve been together now for over 20 years
8315688 i suspect theres a tremendous chance hell be on the property next year but the most important thing is that he gets his knee back where he wants to
8315689 i have been involved in sports for a very long time being a sports official
8315690 i used to be in charge of snooker later after the cricket association was established i got to know more and more about cricket and began to like it more and more so i changed from snooker to cricket
8315691 i think that cricket in china is already moving ahead
8315692 they have 140 level one coaches and umpires now theyve achieved that in the period since 2005 that is indeed very noteworthy
8315693 the icc has believed for quite some time that there is a real opportunity for cricket in china and one of our projects is to explore the possibility of cricket becoming very large in this country
8315694 the icc came to us and said they had a very charming game which could be introduced to china and at that time the then vice president and secretary general of the cca paid a visit to hong kong to observe the hong kong international sixes
8315695 we found that cricket is very good for chinese people because it emphasises hand eye co ordination
8315696 now what we need to do urgently is improve our high performance
8315697 with high performance in the big events such as the asian games we can grab the attention of a mass of the people so it will then be easier to promote cricket they will know it and they will love it
8315698 this is not the time for excuses we have been outplayed england are playing with huge motivation and huge aggression
8315699 we have got to find out what the problem is we have got a lot of experience and we have got to tap into a bit of that
8315700 we have had times on this tour when we have had to look at each other honestly and find out what mistakes we are making our rhythm and confidence is not right i dont think reading the riot act is going to help
8315701 outside of world cup semi finals this is right down there in terms of lows we did not assess conditions well enough
8315702 we have got to look at ourselves and match the england team in the way we have matched in the time that i have been involved all of us need to get together
8315703 it was not a 280 wicket and that affected how we played there was a bit of bounce but if we could have got 230 we could have put them under a pressure but when you are only chasing 80 you play with freedom
8315704 i am trying to get into him that it is really great to be on a wave but you have got to get to a level where you are cool and calm and deliver
8315705 after the catch i said it was a great catch but you have got a job to do you are there to be focused after being dropped he could have gone and felt sorry for himself but he has done a fantastic job he is a hell of a batsman
8315706 odds of treasury stepping in and dealing with fannie mae fnm n and freddie mac fre n before the end of this year have been considerably diminished
8315707 its a little of a race between the profits on the portfolios and the losses they are taking on defaults and mark to market write downs
8315708 at the same time data is looking like the housing market is near a bottom
8315709 i kind of had constructed this myth for myself that in order to be creative i couldnt be analytical
8315710 in order to feel i couldnt think too much in order to be expressive i couldnt be focused and disciplined i think i always recognized that it was a myth but it was a convenient myth to buy into it was a great excuse for not practicing
8315711 if i really had my way i wouldnt even consider a record contract now because i dont think im really ready theres just too much focus on young people in jazz these days and there are older musicians who deserve the recording deals a lot more but i guess its a once in a lifetime opportunity so youve got to take it
8315712 as the years have gone by every time i come back to boston i get a better feeling
8315713 like a lot of people coming out of college i was interested in the social problems of the day and how some of those things could be addressed alleviated
8315714 obviously to get anything done in society you need to know the law so i was interested in it from that standpoint
8315715 like lot of people who go to law school i didnt know exactly what i wanted to do and law school seemed like the place to go if you dont know that
8315716 i wish i were 10 percent as focused and studious with music as i was as a student at the university
8315717 what were big deals were the opportunities i was getting almost immediately to play with these incredible musicians people i grew up idolizing like my father charlie haden elvin jones jack dejohnette paul motian roy haynes pat metheny
8315718 i got a chance to play with all these people within six months of moving to new york and more i was invited to play with these musicians and then i was invited back i couldnt really understand it but i went with it
8315719 i dont have any of that in my day to day the way i navigate the world interact with people in music i think i have that and maybe have that in a different way than a lot of my peers i had no expectations no agenda i had set for myself i dont even want to say that served me well but it served me in some respect
8315720 i was familiar with some of the artists who had received the arts medal in the past and theyre some of the greatest artists of our time so i was like what
8315721 i can confirm that im moving to tottenham i will fly to england as soon as i receive an english entry visa
8315722 but pavlyuchenko is likely join tottenham in the nearest future
8315723 we have had talks but there is nothing to confirm yet
8315724 the drop of five points changed the light signal from yellow blue to blue

8315750 we are using a lot of sirf chips but we do not expect a substantial impact on mitacs shipments this year
8315751 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
8315752 the thing is they got guys that are willing to make a three year commitment which i think is tremendous
8315753 we had guys that committed for 2004 and then all of a sudden 9 11 happened and then there were injuries
8315754 this is not the time to speak of officiating but i think with the fiba rules we would have won that is why we are a little annoyed because we were right there at the finish line and we have just missed out

8315916 nu vreau sa mi intorci inima vreau sa fie a ta tot ce am tie iti apartine si viata si sufletul meu au fost puse pe altarul dragostei noastre sunt al tau pentru totdeauna te rog sa mi devii sotie si mama a copiilor nostri

8315927 we havent changed our view but we are giving the people a chance for reassessment
8315928 we think we made the correct decision but we allow them developers to come out with all their arguments to re validate our decision by giving the people a chance to air their views
8315929 we thought it was a good idea so we called them to discuss
8315930 this is the first time maybe in selangor that we have a town hall meeting between two bodies that have been confronting each other but who are now able to sit down in a civilised manner and find improvement for the state
8315931 one of the developers said it was a good thing and should have been done 20 years ago so this issue would not have arisen
8315932 there was nothing much we could do as we could not get out of the jln travers police station and fire trucks could not get to the scene due to the traffic jam
8315933 traffic resumed albeit slowly within a short time even though the volume of rainwater was as much as in april our personnel were deployed to the site to manage traffic and some helped pump rainwater into the pond
8315934 all development must abide by our policies under the new urban storm water management whereby developers should have structures on their sites to trap water and thus should have zero contribution towards flash floods dbkl enforces and monitors this
8315935 tomorrow is the first anniversary of my mothers death and the house is filled with mud the water started rising at 4 30pm and only subsided at 6pm

8315945 it is a great honor to announce that our distinguished chairman david flaum will be addressing the gop convention next week
8315946 david flaums participation in the gop convention program is another example of the high priority the gop gives to the issues of importance to the jewish community and another indicator of the continued inroads the gop is making amongst jewish voters
8315947 our next president will have a mandate to build an enduring global peace on the foundations of freedom security opportunity prosperity and hope
8315948 ik ben me van geen kwaad bewust en laat ze maar komen
8315949 als wij destijds ons werk niet gedaan hadden het door de politiek niet zo goed was opgepakt
8315950 the launching of our home site really sets our focus for the next few months leading to the historic general election
8315951 americans from across the country and indeed people from all over the world can find simple factual information on the true financial conditions facing our governments illinois alone faces a 70 billion hole in the state budget and we believe our new website will be a valuable resource to educate the public
8315952 i attended the special screening last night for the i o u s a documentary what an amazing film
8315953 it successfully shows the financial condition of our country in understandable terms
8315954 the institute for truth in accounting is the sponsor of the illinois public accountability pledge which ask elected officials to introduce legislation that would require the states financial report to be issued on a timely basis
8315955 this critical maintenance work will clear our backlog and will also require a fire fighting capability to remain on station while the work is performed
8315956 this in turn allows the extension of the entire compliment of fire fighters at springfield through september 2009
8315957 thank you for your strong support for a ready reliable relevant and accessible air national guard
8315958 the national guard firefighter unit is critical to springfields ability to handle an emergency and im pleased that lieutenant general blum recognizes that
8315959 but i will continue to urge the air force and the national guard to work together to find a new flying mission to secure the long term future of the firefighting unit and the 183rd fighter wing
8315960 the 183rd fighter wing and its firefighter unit in springfield provide invaluable support to illinois security readiness and emergency preparedness
8315961 the national guard took an important step today by granting a one year extension of the firefighter unit however i will continue working with senator durbin to secure a long term flying mission for the 183rd and maintain these emergency response capabilities in our state
8315962 work closely with the air force leadership to determine the feasibility of a follow on flying mission for the 183rd
8315963 we need to reach out to and educate people in a way that keeps up with the times
8315964 our goal in creating basuah in second life is to provide innovative opportunities to keep the dialogue on hiv aids education and prevention in the fore front of peoples minds
8315965 this is an important collaboration between uis csu and idph
8315966 after certifying more than 1 000 ambassadors through our online training program we are excited about breaking ground in this new environment we look forward to our continued collaboration and success in this very important initiative
8315967 but hillarys speech reminded me that im not a republican and im not excited about voting republican tonight reminded me that i am still a democrat at heart
8315968 i think they are hell bent on having a pretend vote
8315969 this is not the usual reaction to an election loss
8315970 i know that is the way it is being spun but its not prototypical anyone who doesnt take time to analyze it will do so at their own peril
8315971 thats our unifying mission were reaching out to the delegates to make sure that they know that were here
8315972 i will never be for obama i dont believe he has been fairly chosen
8315973 we would love to see her in the white house
8315974 a lot of our members have been threatened with death a number of our bloggers have been hacked weve had a lot of cyberterrorism
8315975 the dnc really pushed barack obama on us now theyve left us with two choices somebody who has no substance or a republican
8315976 and these are terrible choices and they worked hard to select this candidate were watching the dnc pick this candidate for us
8315977 we are here to oppose the primary process as fraudulent intimidating misogynist
8315978 i do not support barack obama i dont think hes experienced enough to be president
8315979 the party is telling us just to suck it up
8315980 as much as it makes me sick im going to have to vote for mccain if she cannot pull out this nomination
8315981 hillary supporters are still very upset with the party very upset with the media very upset with the process to the point where i think millions of them will not vote for obama in november
8315982 i find him inexperienced i find him insincere we have an unqualified candidate who has little more than empty rhetoric and a lot of money at his disposal
8315983 im a registered democrat but i will be voting for mccain
8315984 we will be looking for cues in what she says
8315985 the last few times she expressed support for obama people picked up that she still wants delegates to fight for her
8315986 like fdr in 1932 senator clinton has the will of the democratic voters behind her it took four roll call votes for fdr to beat the party machine we are here to make sure that senator clinton has a fair vote
8315987 were here to see hillary clinton emerge as the partys nominee even if that doesnt happen we still wont be voting for obama in november
8315988 allowed the primary campaign to go forward with the sexism in the media going unchecked by the party along with the disenfranchisement of florida and michigan and the shenanigans in iowa and texas in the caucuses
8315989 a lot of delegates came into headquarters today and said its like an oasis with hillary buttons and signs everywhere
8315990 were giving cover to delegates and others who still believe senator clinton is the best choice for the party
8315991 its a total diss to senator clinton in my opinion
8315992 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
8315993 en t rminos muy reales uno puede sentir que este partido se raja
8315994 em termos reais poss vel sentir que o partido se racha
8315995 en mi opini n es una afrenta total a la senadora clinton
8315996 explica de manera abundante que barack obama no piensa defender principio alguno
8315997 en mi opini n es una afrenta total a la senadora clinton
8315998 explica de manera abundante que barack obama no piensa defender principio alguno
8315999 a nica maneira de mudar o partido democrata se perderem o nico poder que nos resta

8316005 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8316006 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8316007 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8316008 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8316009 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8316010 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about

8316160 in this difficult housing environment real estate professionals and home sellers need to do all they can to differentiate their property
8316161 while perceived value is not the same as what someone ultimately pays for a property it sets the benchmark as to what this property is worth in a buyers mind compared to other homes in the same neighborhood first impressions often have a big impact on a buyers decision making process on which homes to visit and how much to offer
8316162 professional photographs and videos are just as essential as a yard sign
8316163 the small investment made by my real estate agent was absolutely worth it and really set my home apart from other properties in the area
8316164 more than 84 percent of prospective home buyers start their search on the internet so the use of video to market a property is essential
8316165 videos are free to create on propertypreviews com so the return on investment is significant and home sellers should be demanding it

8316182 we have also got the knowledge and experience of andrew flintoff and steve harmison and they are always passing it on we are all bowling for each other and the fielding has been fantastic which only gives the bowlers confidence hopefully we can seal the series on friday
8316183 we are doing everything well at the moment we are turning up on time turning up on form and hammering the training sessions the recipe for success is hard work and the boys are doing the simple things better than the other team but i am not going to go overboard we have not won the series yet
8316184 we can only apologize for a very poor performance people were rightly angry that they did not get a proper game
8316185 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8316186 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
8316187 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it
8316188 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8316189 global tour and is not targeting any specific player or country
8316190 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8316191 we are connecting with fans and sponsors like never before
8316192 but we want things to continue to get better to continue to grow
8316193 wed been running the taps on frank balistrieri for close to a year

8316195 lefty rosenthal ran the skim operation in las vegas rockman would travel to chicago or kansas city to get clevelands share bill presser a teamster power broker and father if future teamster president jackie presser and roy williams received about 1 500 a month for their role in the skim the cleveland family received a total of about 40 000 a month
8316196 these defendants have dealt a severe blow to the state and the industry and have made a mockery of the nevada regulatory procedures
8316197 its awesome mate the first time you see it in real life its a shock factor to be real honest
8316198 its just so big obviously its an extremely impressive boat very very powerful
8316199 for us at the end of the day its all part of our preparation when you look at this boat you just think boy who wouldnt want to see two of these boats race each other its amazing i cant tell you how many four letter words people have used when they see it
8316200 its something that im pretty excited about the main thing with multihulls is you always try to sail as light as you can but with a boat like this and the power its got its also going to take a lot of physical effort by the crew its going to be an interesting few months
8316201 were going to be very very conservative and take things very slowly
8316202 obviously if things go wrong on a boat of this size it can be extremely bad the important part is to take our time
8316203 cant get overly excited by a down in the situation right now because this process does go up and down
8316204 were at a crossroads and jordan must protect itself and its national interests
8316205 find out what the jordanians are up to and if their contacts with hamas meant dropping support for the palestinian authority
8316206 were against any negotiations with hamas because we regard it as a terrorist movement
8316207 we should find ways to strengthen the palestinian authority instead of legitimizing hamas which made an illegal military coup in gaza
8316208 if we are working on the basis of our mutual interests then its logical to implement this agreement
8316209 this is an old way of doing things that has nothing to do with modern realities
8316210 primarily i think the u s was looking for things to take away and penalize russia for in georgia

8316238 the investigation quickly expanded when a distribution network that imported marijuana into the united states from canada was identified

8316242 we are reducing our rating to neutral as we are incrementally more cautious on the commercial performance of byetta following the latest update
8316243 we cannot conclude whether pancreatitis is any more an issue with byetta than other diabetes drugs however we think meaningful gains in the stock will require proof amylin lilly can jump start its growth in the second half 2008 against these latest headwinds and no negative new news from the ongoing healthcare database analysis
8316244 we are downgrading shares of amylin to sell from hold following last nights disclosure of four additional cases of mortality associated with pancreatitis in patients who were on byetta as we believe that a heightened vigilance for patient safety among primary care physicians will blunt the rate of glp 1 adoption driving byetta lars npv lower

8316268 que pena que uribe se defienda con su rabia y no con su inteligencia
8316269 la idea es tomar una serie de acciones que nos permitan reducir el tema de habitantes de calle en los pr ximos cuatro a os pero igualmente generarle unas condiciones para estas personas
8316270 en el programa de moreno este tipo de poblaci n desapareci totalmente si no se adoptan pol ticas definitivas es muy posible que siga incrementado porque la soluci n no es darles comida y ba arlos hay que buscar programas de rehabilitaci n verdaderos
8316271 yo creo que el gobierno est subestimando lo que pasa en estas zonas que no s lo se convierten en el lugar donde van a dormir quienes viven en la calle all se trafican drogas armas y se delinque
8316272 el tema no tiene que ver con pobreza sino con adicciones y eso es mucho m s dif cil lo que pasa es que el proceso de cada una de estas personas vale por lo menos 10 millones de pesos y requiere de tiempo y compromiso las 24 horas
8316273 que pena que uribe se defienda con su rabia y no con su inteligencia

8316281 sin fecha l mite aunque las cosas no pueden ser eternas como no puede ser eterno tampoco el uso pol tico del concepto solidaridad
8316282 la solidaridad es lo que uno hace libremente lo que hace catalu a al resto del estado es una aportaci n para que territorios que necesitan apoyo para su desarrollo lo puedan tener pero esto no puede ser eterno catalu a no puede estar toda su vida viendo como se puede empezar a dejar de atender ciertas necesidades porque debamos atender otras
8316283 si damos recursos es para ayudar y colaborar a que se creen empresas no para que se vaya incrementando el sector p blico con m s y m s funcionarios
8316284 deseo que catalu a por primera vez tenga una financiaci n que empiece a ser justa
8316285 empiecen a ser conscientes de que catalu a no puede tener una aportaci n eterna hacia el resto del estado porque aqu tambi n hay solidaridades a ejercer dentro del propio territorio

8316312 take at amp t for example glenn greenwald of salon com recently pointed out that the democratic conventioneers and registered media in attendance will receive a tote bag prominently emblazoned with the at amp t logo its a perfect metaphor for a much larger gift the one democrats and republicans just gave at amp t and other telecoms retroactive immunity for spying on u s citizens while sens russ feingold and chris dodd fought the bill sen barack obama until recently a staunch opponent of telecom immunity reversed his position and supported it reneging on a pledge to filibuster perfect timing

8316351 marcus wareing is emerging from ramsays shadow as the proprietor of what is now clearly the best restaurant in london
8316352 it is hardly surprising than an impassioned individual concentrating on one establishment such as marcus wareing has overtaken the flagship of an ever more celebrity driven empire where the name chef is rarely present
8316353 it is the disappointing standards at ramsays three most recent mass market openings which are most immediately concerning each of them the warrington devonshire house and foxtrot oscar is nominated in roughly one in every three of the survey reports they attract in the most disappointing meal of the year category these newcomers are so uninspired in concept and so erratic in performance that if they were opened by independent operators they would likely be closed within a year

8316355 we are very proud of the huge success of p trus which was opened by grh in march 1999 and as a company we have been instrumental in continually raising its game to help it evolve into the restaurant that it is today
8316356 grh have taken the one and two top spots in the current hardens guide which is surely cause for plaudits rather than the inevitably negative spin that the guides editors have chosen in order to generate publicity for their guide
8316357 i am incredibly proud to have achieved this accolade particularly from such a respected guide as hardens
8316358 it is our feeling that the writers of restaurant guides such as hardens vary in their opinions from food guides such as michelin and it is the latter that our industry as a whole looks to as the ultimate gauge of success

8316599 our findings suggest that increased brain connections during chronic drug use may actually limit behavioral changes associated with drug addiction rather than support them
8316600 relapse or the resumption of active drug taking and drug seeking is very common in drug addicts
8316601 addiction related brain changes and behaviors seem to be hardwired and semipermanent and there are limited treatment options our data suggest that rather than trying to block the process of increasing dendritic spine density we may actually want to look at treatments that try to enhance this process
8316602 this suggests the exciting possibility that mef2 proteins may control expression of key genes that modulate drug related brain changes and behavior
8316603 if we understand which genes are influenced by mef2 we can intervene and try to help the system resist or reverse these sensitization processes
8316604 although several groups have documented that repeated cocaine exposure increases nac spine density the precise molecular mechanisms that control this process have remained elusive
8316605 moreover the cocaine induced increase in nac spine density has been hypothesized to contribute to the long lasting behavioral sensitization that occurs after repeated cocaine exposure but direct evidence concerning the functional relationship between these two processes is lacking

8316607 humans frequently invoke an argument that their intuition can result in a better decision than conscious reasoning
8316608 such assertions may rely on subconscious associative learning between subliminal signals present in a given situation and choice outcomes

8316642 patients who used statins before an ami and continued to take them after were 16 less likely to die over the next year than those who never used them so even if it appears that the statins failed to prevent your ami it is beneficial to continue taking them and potentially quite harmful to stop
8316643 in the general population the statin discontinuation rate within the first year of prescription is 30 percent thats very high
8316644 because statins are preventative drugs patients may not feel the immediate benefit of taking them and sometimes stop however it looks like this might be quite a dangerous practice after an ami

8316780 you get only a brief glimpse of sunlight before its all cloudy again the winters are mild but in summer the temperatures seldom go higher than 20c and it rains rains rains in future i would like to test myself in another top league im thinking of spain at least there will be no reason to complain about the weather in england they say that manchester is the city of rain its main attraction is considered to be the timetable at the railway station where trains leave for other less rainy cities
8316781 id like to clarify that i did not make these particular remarks
8316782 i spoke about the difficulty i had settling in to life in manchester but that does not reflect how i feel now i enjoy my life very much as a footballer at manchester united and im very happy to be a part of this great club i think i show that in the way i play every week i also have far too much respect for the people of manchester and england to criticise them in this way

8316789 il governo dovrebbe cogliere loccasione dellinsostenibilit economico finanziaria di alitalia per abbracciare un modello di trasporti alternativo rispetto a quello che drogato di finanziamenti pubblici ha fatto crescere come funghi improbabili aeroporti locali e relativi collegamenti stradali chiediamo al governo di ritornare sulla scelta sciagurata di boicottare la vendita a air france proponiamo a berlusconi di vendere nel pi breve tempo alitalia alle migliori condizioni possibili realisticamente a air france ma comunque al miglior offerente e usare integralmente quei soldi pochi assieme alle mancate perdite immense per investire nelle infrastrutture ferroviarie
8316790 il risultato che avremo forse una piccola compagnia magari nazionale o regionale ma che difficilmente sar alla pari del traffico aereo mondiale tutto questo si poteva evitare il merger con air france sarebbe gi stato operante litalia sarebbe entrata in una rete di traffico mondiale mentre ora i contribuenti dovranno accollarsi debiti esuberi e costo degli ammortizzatori sociali
8316791 si sono persi dei mesi e la soluzione che adesso si profila coster ai contribuenti italiani e al paese molto di pi di quanto non sarebbe costata con air france una soluzione quella che ci propina lattuale esecutivo che prevede pi del doppio degli esuberi di personale di quelli ipotizzati cinque mesi fa che attiva procedure fallimentari ad hoc con la costituzione di una bad company nella quale far confluire debiti ed esuberi e che con procedure altrettanto ad hoc rischia di violare le norme antitrust creando un pericoloso precedente
8316792 la commissione europea non pu che guardare positivamente al salvataggio di alitalia tramite capitali privati un fatto positivo che fa crescere la concorrenza e che rafforza il mercato in europa sarebbe stato un danno per il mercato e anche per il turismo se una compagnia importante come quella di bandiera fosse fallita

8316800 it was an incredibly successful event that will make a very significant impact with speedway childrens charities and the non profit organizations it provides financial assistance to through grants this year
8316801 the real heroes are the 30 people who made the generous donation to participate in this event
8316802 it was a lot of fun for me and i hope it was for everyone else today it is a pleasure to donate my time for speedway childrens charities and lend a hand in making an impact in the local community

8316806 ive felt like weve had a chance to be in the chase since the beginning of the year
8316807 our aaa ford has been fast every week and as a team we havent made many mistakes we deserve to be in the position we are in and just have to take these last two races one at a time
8316808 we need to get ourselves in the chase that is goal number one to do that we need to have good finishes we need to run well we need to compete at a high level and we need to get the best finish that we can
8316809 we certainly dont want to put ourselves in a situation that we didnt have to be in because i did something silly or we had a mechanical problem but at the same time you have to compete at a high level the competition is too tough
8316810 we have a lot of forward momentum and progress with this race team
8316811 i feel like we are one of the guys to be considered a favorite in the championship and look forward to getting started
8316812 ive all along said i would put the championship if i was to see the championship i would go off experience
8316813 i just think the competition is going to continue to increase youre going to see the pressure really do its best and worst to everyone in the chase its just going to be part of it
8316814 the chase is a lot closer to equal to what we have now
8316815 so i think its a great opportunity we get into the final ten and its great tracks for myself and the 48 team
8316816 im so excited to finally get to meet the cast of the office
8316817 jims my favorite character hes everybodys favorite i just think its a great show its kind of like cheers and seinfeld were in their hay day to me thats what its like for this generation or for this decade its just a good show its a really funny show well written great cast and its just done really well
8316818 its pretty hard to believe im coming up on my 500th start
8316819 professionally theres nothing else id rather be doing competing in nascars top level series has been a lifelong dream and im fortunate that i have been doing what i love for as long as i have but i still believe my best years are ahead of me ive learned a lot over the years and this environment has made me a better person because of it racing is something i dreamed of as a kid and im fortunate that i am doing it
8316820 the response we have received since we started this tournament is truly humbling

8316830 in the second case reported aug 18 death was due to a complicated medical course that included necrotizing pancreatitis
8316831 since 2006 the u s prescribing information for byetta has included information about pancreatitis
8316832 in 2007 after discussions with the fda amylin and lilly amended the prescribing information to include pancreatitis as a precaution
8316833 based on our evaluation we believe byetta continues to have a positive benefit risk profile for patients with type 2 diabetes
8316834 for every 3 000 patients who have taken byetta for a year one would have reported a case of pancreatitis
8316835 most pancreatitis cases resolve with supportive treatment and stopping the suspected medication including byetta
8316836 we needed to strengthen our defence and anton is a great signing

8316843 the ryan tax plan is the kemp roth plan for the next 20 years thats where the movement is going
8316844 there could be some people making 100 000 that would be better off but i have to think that the bulk of the money is going to people at the top rates
8316845 mccains proposals this year are consistently pretty supply side even more so than bushs were
8316846 i cannot in good conscience support a tax cut in which so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate among us at the expense of middle class americans who most need tax relief
8316847 there was a hiccup and we were very critical of his votes in 2001 and 2003 but by 2004 he said these tax cuts have been very helpful to the economy and now hes got a low tax pro growth position
8316848 if we are working on the basis of our mutual interests then its logical to implement this agreement
8316849 this is an old way of doing things that has nothing to do with modern realities

8316861 we have been approached by third parties who are interested in exploring future possibilities for viper
8316862 as the company evaluates strategic options to maximize core operations and leverage its assets we have agreed to listen to these parties
8316863 you see a lot less old school hardnosed my way or the highway coaching because players now are just different than they were when my father started out
8316864 thats what monte kiffin says coaching back then players just wanted to play they just loved playing football now so much more goes into it and they make so much money that you have to find different ways to motivate them the two things that motivate them are playing time and money
8316865 if you can get them better theyre gonna listen because that gets them to play more so they can make more money on the next contract
8316866 the love of the game theyre playing as much for the money and thats where you have to interact so much with your players and understand them and see what motivates them
8316867 but i dont think you have to give in necessarily ive been in the league for 25 years and before that i coached high school my approach to players hasnt changed im hands on and ill talk to any player one on one i choose to do it the way ive always done it
8316868 they get so much money right away so they arent striving to say i have to do everything right because i have to play 10 years and make enough money because i dont know what im going to do after football
8316869 so many of these guys get so much money in their first second or third year that the money factor isnt about supporting their family

8316874 conditions are very different from land transport due to the risk of the system getting wet with sea water or being subjected to constant shaking
8316875 the aim is for him to be a crucial player for us but that is not down to me because he will have to be the one to prove it on the pitch
8316876 we have signed him knowing that he has spent a couple of years not being able to give his best because he not adapted well but here he will settle into the country because the language is the same
8316877 he is well known in mexico but he not yet famous in europe if he wants to win a place in this team he will have to be at his best
8316878 nery has a good r sum because he has played for some big clubs since he was 16 or 17 but he had his problems in ukraine and in england
8316879 now though we expect him to put that behind him and show us what he is really capable of
8316880 he has had a bit of contact work and the medical opinion is very strong that he will be fit for the sale game
8316881 jonny is having a scan this week just to make sure that everything has healed up
8316882 he had as full a part in training on our recent trip to france as was appropriate at this time in his recovery
8316883 certainly part of our strategy was that we could not afford to have four guys in a backline that were going to be missing for 11 games
8316884 the four players that have to replace them are not going to be of equivalent quality because it is going to be difficult to carry four international backs to cover them when they are away
8316885 oh what a rotten way to start such a lovely day

8316910 i dont mean by that letter that we have to stop the peace process and just discuss the security of my person
8316911 we have been approached by third parties who are interested in exploring future possibilities for viper
8316912 as the company evaluates strategic options to maximize core operations and leverage its assets we have agreed to listen to these parties we will do so keeping in mind the best interests of those who have shown tremendous support for the vehicle including employees suppliers dealers and a worldwide group of loyal viper owners and enthusiasts viper is an integral part of this companys heritage while this is a strategic review our intent would be to offer strong operational and financial support during any potential transaction in order to ensure a future for the viper business and perpetuate the legacy of this great vehicle

8316927 our departures left on time tuesday afternoon apparently because their flight plans had been filed early enough and our arrivals which is the primary block of flight in the evening werent affected because apparently the problems were resolved in time for them to get in without delay

8316949 this is a tough district for democrats but frank kratovil is a very independent minded pragmatic centrist moderate candidate very much a mold of wayne gilchrest
8316950 i think that frank kratovil represents gilchrest tradition of moderation and i think his political temperament its much better with that district than does the person who hes running against
8316951 and his opponent andy harris is very much on the right fringe
8316952 his strategy needs to focus on the fact that the positions andy harris has taken is like bush on steroids
8316953 the key is to have enough recourses to be able to get his message out and that is why its important for him to raise the money to tell his story
8316954 there were a lot of people who supported senator obama early and i was not one of them he understandably feels an amount of loyalty and obligation i am sure to make sure that they are given an opportunity especially if they risked a lot politically by coming out early for him

8317021 cemetery officials heard our concerns and were not very receptive to changing their plans
8317022 if they were to replace the monument with the same marble material it would eventually start cracking again
8317023 for now we will intermittently repair the monument with grouting process that should hold for several years at a time
8317024 cracks cannot be repaired indefinitely without the monument acquiring a patched worn and shabby appearance which is the antithesis of its purpose and contrary to arlington national cemeterys mission of maintaining a dignified fitting memorial to our countrys fallen soldiers
8317025 i worry that as the cracks worsen it will eventually take away from the visitors experience

8317099 ive been really disappointed with our performances this season and i have told the players that
8317100 i think we need to improve in every area in the second leg
8317101 we were lucky to leave belgium with a 0 0 when you see the goal that wasnt given and the penalty it could have been worse and we were not a threat at all but the positive is that it can be a wake up call the players must understand what a massive game this is
8317102 the first thing is silverware i like to talk about trophies that is the main thing
8317103 but the champions league is also about money and you have to take the two things together but we are here to win titles not to make money i always tell my players that if they win games they win trophies and then they will have higher wages and more money it is the same for the club
8317104 they are well organised they have good players and they have quality it will be a tough game for us because when a smaller club faces a top side they can play without pressure
8317105 that was their best game together so far the understanding between them was much better but the team didnt play well and all the attention went to carra jamie carragher and steven gerrard because of their goals
8317106 you have to put eight british players on the list and we had to decide before the first leg
8317107 so we considered who might be in the final and left javier and lucas out
8317108 well give it our best but if we somehow manage to get through it will rank as the biggest shock by a belgian side in europe for 40 years
8317109 all i keep hearing is how poorly liverpool are playing at the moment but when i looked at the premier league table on saturday night im pretty sure they were top with maximum points thats some poor start

8317129 i had with me a nikon camera and around 90 film rolls with tell tale evidence of blatant demographic colonialism being perpetrated by the chinese inside tibet through a systematic disfiguring of all that has to do with tibet its people its culture and age old traditions
8317130 before opening tibet to international tourism china took care to ensure that visitors cant see anything that china does not want them to see it is like a murderer throwing a party after cleaning up the murder site spotting meaningful frames in such a situation is a great challenge to a professional photo journalist
8317131 when i approached the dalai lama for the first time in 1972 at his dharamshala headquarters it was with a kind of professional detachment not out of any reverence or any sense of spiritual allegiance but when i met him i was greatly impressed by him he converted 80 000 tibetan refugees in india into one of the best organised refugee settlements
8317132 it was to lend a sense of credibility to my tibetan studies that i decided to take advantage of the chinese decision to open up tibet to tourists and entered the region for the first time in 2003 on a tourist visa
8317133 there is no doubt that urban parts of tibet have undergone tremendous modernisation wonderful malls wide roads impressive housing complexes and most lavish car brands are seen on the streets only if you can distinguish between a chinese and a tibetan face would you realise who owns these goodies and for whose benefit all this development is being undertaken

8317204 although it is relatively rare to find the eggs and babies of extinct animals it is even rarer to find them inside the body of the mother
8317205 the turtle specimen was partly broken when it was first discovered it is this fortuitous break that revealed that the fossil was a mother
8317206 based on these fossils we have determined that the ancestor of living hidden necked turtles which are most of todays turtles and tortoises laid a large number of eggs and had hard rigid shells
8317207 this project represents a commitment from both companies to push the limits for extracting hydrocarbons from high temperature and deeply buried reservoirs
8317208 we already have ultra high pressure tools rated to 30 000 pounds per square inch by collaborating with total we have a strategic ally that can help us accelerate the development of an ultra high temperature logging while drilling system

8317213 we have the people the capital and the technological skills to make a difference i would argue that a proactive attitude on this matter is good for the environment but also good for business
8317214 if carbon dioxide has a sufficiently high price we know what to do to reduce emissions but agreeing on such a framework is perhaps the political challenge of our time
8317215 there is no quick fix route to a non fossil future fossil fuels will be crucial to meet growing energy demand the next few decades

8317233 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
8317234 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
8317235 freeze drying the berries concentrates these elements about ten times giving us a power pack of chemoprevention agents that can influence the different signaling pathways that are deregulated in cancer
8317236 these changes in gene expression correlated with changes in the tissue that included greater cell proliferation marked inflammation and increased apoptosis
8317237 because both berries and the second agent maintain near normal levels of expression of these 53 genes we believe their early deregulation may be especially important in the development of esophageal cancer

8317240 although several groups have documented that repeated cocaine exposure increases nac spine density the precise molecular mechanisms that control this process have remained elusive
8317241 moreover the cocaine induced increase in nac spine density has been hypothesized to contribute to the long lasting behavioral sensitization that occurs after repeated cocaine exposure but direct evidence concerning the functional relationship between these two processes is lacking
8317242 taken together our findings implicate mef2 as a key regulator of structural synapse plasticity and sensitized responses to cocaine and suggest that reducing mef2 activity and thereby increasing spine density in the nac may be a compensatory mechanism to limit long lasting maladaptive behavioral responses to cocaine
8317243 a better understanding of the mef2 associated molecular mechanisms that regulate cocaine induced structural and behavioral plasticity could ultimately lead to the development of improved treatments for drug addiction

8317246 caregivers have similar cortisol levels as controls their cells seem to be hearing less of this signal in other words something goes awry in caregivers white blood cells so they are not able to receive the signal from cortisol that tells them to shut down inflammation
8317247 because people have traditionally thought that higher cortisol is the reason that stress contributes to disease but this work shows that at least in caregivers its actually the opposite theres too little cortisol signal being heard by the cells rather than too much
8317248 our primary findings suggested that smoking physical inactivity and obesity are inversely associated with awareness of the psa test these risk behaviors are linked with higher prostate cancer morbidity and mortality
8317249 the results concur with our initial hypothesis that men who adopt unhealthy lifestyles may be less concerned with health and less aware of preventive measures like the psa test
8317250 these new findings have several clinical implications besides the impairment of sexual function in these young men
8317251 the lack of testosterone during these critical years may lead to diminished bone mass and the lack of development or lose of skeletal muscle in addition these patients may gain more weight with an average body mass index of 38 they already were obese and become more insulin resistant
8317252 also patients with low testosterone and type 2 diabetes have been shown to have very high concentrations of c reactive protein
8317253 which increases their risk of developing atherosclerosis and heart disease above and beyond the risk associated with diabetes
8317254 while obesity contributes to the association of type 2 diabetes and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism hh the association is not dependent entirely on obesity
8317255 in our first study of diabetic men we found that 31 percent of lean type 2 diabetics also had hh so it is likely that factors other than obesity contribute to hh possibly insulin resistance
8317256 whether obesity or insulin resistance is the major determinant of hh has to be addressed in future studies and the pathogenesis of hh needs to be defined
8317257 we now report evidence that restoration of the functioning of the stress axis may be the key to how these new antidepressant approaches might work
8317258 these findings lend weight to the hope that crf1 antagonists might play a role in the treatment of antidepressant resistant symptoms of depression or posttraumatic stress disorder if so crf1 antagonists could fulfill an important unmet need
8317259 we do not need another prozac but we urgently need to find ways to help the large number of patients who fail to respond adequately to our available treatments

8317271 if you already have managers in place and the employees would normally report to them then those managers need to continue their function
8317272 if you own a restaurant and already have a shift manager whos responsible for doing the interview and training the new employee then the shift manager should interview and train your relative
8317273 take your family member through the same hiring procedure as you would for anyone else this may mean having them fill out an application come to an interview submit to a background check and a take drug test
8317274 when it comes time to evaluate their performance their manager should conduct the evaluation using the same process thats used for everyone else

8317389 we are pleased to support these new programs for a global company headquartered in wichita and expanding throughout the world
8317390 as spirit aerosystems grows and continues to diversify its customer base wichita and kansas must work together to secure new investments and programs
8317391 we know we compete against other states and communities for new programs our securing these new programs helps grow our communitys economic future for the next generation while continuing to provide a great return on investment for public dollars
8317392 when you die a timeline appears on screen allowing you to scroll back and forth through the recording to choose a precise moment to continue playing from the game chooses a default of about 15 seconds or so providing a nice standard checkpoint for you to painlessly respawn at
8317393 things get really interesting when you return to the main menu not only can you view your saved replays but you can also jump back in and play from any point on the timeline you can upload these clips to share with friends or simply use them as evidence to compete with other online players an entire section of the leaderboards is devoted to time trials and the top spots will be accompanied by video proof this is a dream scenario for speedrun fans
8317394 itll be hard not being involved in mgs5 but ive got the utmost confidence that hideo kojima ken imaizumi and our amazing team will put together another blockbuster game
8317395 word travels fast so ive been getting a lot of great offers lately but the plan is to take it easy spend time with my family and carefully decide where i land next
8317396 i think the best way characterize it for mattel at the end of the day is this isnt a negative but its a lack of incremental positive
8317397 although we project 2008 byetta sales of over 700 million sales growth has slowed since the launch of mercks januvia and the approval of other glp 1 analogues liraglutide is likely to further pressure byetta over the next 24 months

8317425 we dont think he is going to tell the backstory so the whole thing just seems kind of icky
8317426 when someone seems like they are hiding something its a big turnoff to the public who want to share in celebrities lives
8317427 because of its focus on female empowerment young women are attracted by wicca popularised by the tv series buffy the vampire slayer
8317428 young women tend to express egalitarian values and dislike the traditionalism and hierarchies they imagine are integral to the church
8317429 the off duty officer was trying to enforce a detainment because of the hit and run

8317431 thats how im treated and thats how im viewed im proud of it
8317432 the critical and fundamental point is that ethnic background should not make a difference the bottom line is that i am an american and proud of it now with your cooperation i hope i can just be a golfer and a human being
8317433 its hypothetical and i think that so far mike bloomberg has said that this term limit thing is not going forward or at least thats the way it seems
8317434 but i think the tick tock is going to be first we have to see what is proposed but i think i would be inclined to run one way or another

8317443 ive been told that there are some circumstances under which its permitted so thats why its important to find out if this case fits those circumstances or exactly what happened
8317444 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure where its heading
8317445 for that reason everyone in gulf needs to be monitoring the storm at that point were expecting it to be a category 3 hurricane
8317446 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8317447 my instinct is it will be a really wet night
8317448 they were all members of a family that had taken shelter since tropical storm fay and left to go home because they thought the danger had passed
8317449 there is simply less product for 30 something women in particular to choose from
8317450 in the old days we believed mr or mrs right would show up someday but as we remain single for much longer and are far more mobile the chances are more remote
8317451 single men are concentrated in rural and remote communities whereas single women prefer the city and lifestyle towns
8317452 a generation ago women were more likely to remain in rural communities
8317453 for some odd reason there are more single men than single women and you find a lot of them in rural communities
8317454 if you find yourself in the wrong town then why not relocate to the right town where you are in the market
8317455 patients who used statins before an ami and continued to take them after were 16 less likely to die over the next year than those who never used them so even if it appears that the statins failed to prevent your ami it is beneficial to continue taking them and potentially quite harmful to stop
8317456 in the general population the statin discontinuation rate within the first year of prescription is 30 percent thats very high
8317457 because statins are preventative drugs patients may not feel the immediate benefit of taking them and sometimes stop however it looks like this might be quite a dangerous practice after an ami
8317458 regardless of the mechanism or explanation physicians should be careful when assessing each patients medication needs
8317459 patients also need to take their medications exactly as prescribed after an ami statins in particular should only be withdrawn after an ami under close clinical supervision
8317460 in the end the charges against the duke athletes turned out not to be true but for nearly nine months duke lived with allegations that three student athletes might have raped a student at a nearby university duke focused on its own reputation but missed an opportunity to talk about the larger issue of rape
8317461 sexual violence is a serious matter and organizations that find themselves confronting such charges even charges they suspect may not be true need to speak clearly and strongly to the issue of rape itself
8317462 humans frequently invoke an argument that their intuition can result in a better decision than conscious reasoning
8317463 such assertions may rely on subconscious associative learning between subliminal signals present in a given situation and choice outcomes
8317464 we reasoned that if subjects were unable to correctly perceive any difference between the masked cues then they were also unable to build conscious representations of cue outcome associations
8317465 the ventral striatum responded to subliminal cues and to visible outcomes in a manner that closely approximates our computational algorithm expressing reward expected values and prediction errors
8317466 we conclude that even without conscious processing of contextual cues our brain can learn their reward value and use them to provide a bias on decision making
8317467 more banks will come on the list as credit problems worsen
8317468 so you will now say i hear the voice of an aclu member dennis do you think that this guy should have shot these people spray painting graffiti on his shop to which my answer is yes i do not to kill not to kill but if he shot them in the legs or in the arms i would have considered the man one of the great advancers of civilization in my time and that is what divides left from right because anybody on the left hearing this would think that this is barbaric whereas i consider not stopping these people in any way that is necessary to be barbaric dennis prager on his radio show
8317469 he would hold his ground until november or even december without a budget and would even consider rolling right into january with the introduction of his next budget

8317475 i didnt even know i won this tournament thats how long it has been
8317476 like i said one is gratitude to the community for the tremendous support weve received and i guess another emotion is also sadness thinking back and remembering what a wonderful husband and father we had and were grateful for the time we had with him and well always remember him

8317479 wed make assumptions in the design but later when we got the software we would need to make changes to the hardware
8317480 we made the difficult decision that we couldnt afford it but also vowed to do the right thing at every step of the line to make them environmentally friendly
8317481 normal laptops use lithium ion but every six months or so theres a large recall because sometimes in bad batches they explode

8317498 i wish i could have given him the moon as well
8317499 weve refined our manufacturing techniques and redesigned our low density ssds to get what the low priced pc market is looking for in the way of improved cost performance and availability
8317500 we think that there is some progress being made in each of those areas
8317501 but what the ntsb wants to see is all of our recommendations implemented
8317502 when he first was diagnosed they continued him on the medication they kept telling me that they thought it was probably unrelated but about a year later he kept progressing and getting worse and then they took him off and said he couldnt be on anything like that anymore
8317503 i honestly dont know and i feel i dont know because there was no heart test prior to putting him on the medication
8317504 its a reasonable test to get as per the guidelines but its not a required test and in the absence of any problems on physical exam and in the absence of any family history its reasonable to not get an ecg
8317505 and the risk of having a problem on these medicines for most children is vanishingly small

8317513 down the road we will be looking at what may be required to rebuild the georgian military
8317514 right now the mission of the united states military is to provide humanitarian assistance
8317515 the danger is letting the russians think they can get away with this and do it again in
8317516 its hard to imagine that the united states would embark on the process of rearming georgia until the conflict has reached a stable equilibrium that at least has the possibility of triggering some kind of military confrontation between the u s and russia

8317532 thats a dumb song why does he want to make bread with her
8317533 she told me she wasnt going to die and leave her children
8317534 and she said she knew i would be looking until i found her
8317535 this whole county has been turned inside out looking for her
8317536 we were never going to give up trying to find her
8317537 we didnt want to give up until we ruled out every hole
8317538 shes got to prove her patriotism shes a democrat she must prove she loves america as opposed to republicans who everyone knooows love america ay just hate half a people living in it
8317539 today the attorneys are going in front of judge larson and hes going to make his ruling on that because we feel its not a 100 million its 20 because they were duplicated
8317540 for what its worth italian speculation says atalanta could also try a swoop for heerenveen midfielder michael bradley but suggested they must be willing to offer 5 million
8317541 the crown prosecution service wishes to make it clear that this prosecution was not an attack upon the practices or ceremonies of shia muslims
8317542 the law exists to protect the young from harm or being exposed to harm in this case both boys were made to take part in the ritual flagellation and suffered injuries to their backs
8317543 we are satisfied that given the age of the children involved the coercion employed by syed mustafa zaidi who did not accept that he was wrong and the possibility of such an incident occurring again the decision to prosecute was the correct one
8317544 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8317545 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8317546 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best
8317547 as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant

8317550 there can be no underestimating the impact of wilkinsons actions his conversion of imitation weapons allowed criminals to arm themselves with guns capable of killing and maiming people
8317551 here we have an armoury factory in the suburbs of berkshire creating deadly weapons that are clearly ending up in the hands of 17 18 19 year olds in inner city urban london
8317552 the availability of these weapons is clearly fuelling violence on our streets they have caused devastating shootings murders and mayhem

8317554 the opportunity to recruit an entire group of active researchers with an international reputation for vision innovation and accomplishment is rare perhaps even unprecedented in information and library science
8317555 their work is closely aligned with the schools efforts in the areas of digital libraries and archives databases institutional repositories information retrieval and information management our students and many others across campus will have an extraordinary opportunity to learn from and collaborate with this world class research team
8317556 the dice group will function as a magnet for students and collaborators
8317557 the group will help us further extend the research computing infrastructure at unc that will benefit us all improve our capacity and capability to conduct larger scale research projects while inspiring new generations of students to understand that considerable attention and deliberate effort are needed to ensure both effective and long term access to information
8317558 a major challenge for the next several decades will be managing the enormous amount of digital data we create in science and research
8317559 the dice group has years of experience and an international reputation for developing innovative systems for managing distributed digital data this will be a huge advantage for carolina as the wave of new data rapidly becomes a tsunami we will have the opportunity to extend our leadership nationally and internationally in managing sharing publishing and archiving research data
8317560 the dice group in collaboration with sils will pursue development of undergraduate masters and doctoral level courses on data grids and preservation environments
8317561 the opportunity to teach academic courses strongly influenced the decision to move to sils and unc we are also interested in pursuing collaborations for the creation of campus cyberinfrastructure and participating on data management projects in support of education patient medical records and emergency preparedness

8317566 but the appeal should be limited beyond those fervent loyalists
8317567 did you know that mccains slogan country first could be translated via the charles krauthammer method into country last why does john mccain hate america
8317568 he knows how good he is as a knife fighter

8317572 if he really thinks that by liberating iraq from a dangerous tyrant america somehow set a bad example that invited russia to invade a small peaceful and democratic nation then he should state it outright because that is a debate i welcome
8317573 conservatives appear genuinely freaked out about the intense loyalty obama inspires
8317574 theyre used to their side deeply believing in a presidential candidate

8317594 kami dulu juga pernah mahasiswa jadi pernah merasakan bagaimana pahitnya ketika teknologi masih jarang dan sulit diakses
8317595 keinginan ada tapi mentok pada bujet banyak kampus sebenarnya tertarik tapi karena dana tidak ada sehingga tidak terealisasi
8317596 ada beda jauh antara apa yang kita dapat di kampus dan apa yang dituntut dalam dunia kerja
8317597 kita tidak mungkin akan menghilangkan jarak tersebut tapi paling tidak bisa kita persempit caranya dengan menguasai teknologi
8317598 agar dunia pendidikan dapat terfasilitasi software asli yang layak bagi kegiatan belajar mengajar

8317843 a lot of cameras with electronics in them if you fired a 50 caliber automatic weapon a few inches away which we get microphonics all over the place
8317844 we beat the shit out of the reds on the che films and they never skipped a beat
8317845 you can buy this camera you can own it thats why people are excited
8317846 you put film in a can and stick it on a shelf and it costs 1 000 a year to store
8317847 with a project that starts as data you have it on a hard drive which has to be nursed and upgraded its an electronic mechanical device that cant be left unplugged
8317848 in the slammin jammin world of production you want a really tough machine that takes very simple approaches to problems
8317849 im not sure red is the way to go its a supercomputer with a lens on it
8317850 honestly if you proposed the film work flow today youd be taken to the city square and hung imagine i told you were going to shoot on superexpensive cameras using rolls of celluloid made in china that are a one time use product susceptible to scratches and that cant be exposed to light and you cant even be sure you got the image until theyre developed and you have to dip them in a special fluid that can ruin them if its mixed wrong people would think i was crazy

8317890 one of the major challenges europe must face with climate change and globalization
8317891 the consequences of the aging population poses a greater threat to the national economy than climate change
8317892 its not as sexy a subject as climate change so this subject gets shoved off into the corner but its economic consequences are enormous and were calling on the government and the opposition to give the priority in a bipartisan way which will enable australia to avoid going bankrupt
8317893 these measures will send a clear message to the world canada takes its responsibilities seriously for environmental protection and enforcement in our arctic waters

8317900 o tema da exposi o flexibility deu me a oportunidade de recuperar ideias que ainda estavam por resolver isto permitiu me criar objectos abertos que tal como um programa podem ser modificados apagados ou reiniciados m ltiplas vezes

8317915 its also something that hasnt been done for a long time in the united states
8317916 but we dont have a lot of margin for error if the first forging is bad it would be quite expensive to redo it
8317917 also you want to see where your samples are being taken and how theyre being taken you want to be able to direct the pilot
8317918 its hard to wax lyrical on the subject because we dont know whats there so we cant guarantee a discovery yet we know that every time we extend our ability to go somewhere we discover new things about how the planet works about how life on the planet is adapted
8317919 we can apply 40 years of experience and build it right
8317920 they are still so strong that i can see them and chelsea being the two slugging it out again for the title they will probably meet again in a repeat of the champions league final too i shouldnt wonder certainly i think arsenal and liverpool have it all on to finish above them chelsea were very strong last week and united will be even stronger than they are now if they sign dimitar berbatov from tottenham as i think they will in the next few days
8317921 weve been a good team over the past two seasons and im confident well be a decent team again i went in at half time feeling quite pleased with us but we ran out of steam in the second half and people like carlos tevez and wayne rooney just popped the ball about when the heat went out of the game
8317922 it was a bonus win we only drew here last season and we lost the season before that it is never an easy place to come but i thought we played good football

8317931 weve done everything we entered victoria crater to do and more
8317932 our experience tells us theres lots of diversity among the cobbles
8317933 we want to get a better characterization of them a statistical sampling from examining more of them will be important for understanding the geology of the area
8317934 the patterns broadly resemble what we saw at the smaller craters opportunity explored earlier
8317935 by looking deeper into the layering we are looking farther back in time
8317936 if opportunity were driving with only five wheels like spirit it probably would never get out of victoria crater
8317937 we also know from experience with spirit that if opportunity were to lose the use of a wheel after it is out on the level ground mobility should not be a problem
8317938 both rovers show signs of aging but they are both still capable of exciting exploration and scientific discovery
8317939 its got to the point now that im going to confront samantha and jenny muro lindsays production assistant myself

8317945 the bay checkerspot butterfly is one of californias early victims of global warming
8317946 rather than providing adequate protected areas to help the bay checkerspot survive in a warming world the fish and wildlife service is cutting holes in its safety net
8317947 critical habitat should provide an essential lifeline for the bay checkerspot butterfly
8317948 species with designated critical habitat are twice as likely to improve as those without it the fish and wildlife service has neglected its responsibility to provide this unique bay area species with the habitat it needs to recover under changing climate conditions and continuing urban sprawl
8317949 the 2008 report finds that campus leaders value sustainability they speak about it plan for it hire staff to support it and the campuses they lead are steadily becoming greener models for the wider society
8317950 at the same time the educational curricula to prepare students for a post college world influenced by climate change are not keeping pace on most campuses the business leaders and facilities managers appear to be making greater strides towards sustainability than their faculty peers
8317951 this report card tells us there is a widening gap between where higher education actually is on teaching sustainability versus where it should be
8317952 given the environmental challenges and opportunities this generation will face i find this cause for deep concern and am committed to working with our partners to address this on both state and federal levels
8317953 the nwf report card is the gold standard for charting the sustainability movement in higher education coverage of both operational and academic programs is particularly important strongly recommended reading for administrators faculty and students
8317954 the campus environment 2008 report card reveals just how well institutions of higher learning are preparing students for the environmental challenges they will face in the 21st century
8317955 many of the men and women who will lead our businesses educational institutions and government agencies in the next 20 years are in college now
8317956 we need to offer todays college students the kind of academic and professional preparation that will ready them to envision and create a healthier and more sustainable world
8317957 do you know how many women have gotten more interested into soccer because of becks the more the merrier and if it takes a bit of sexing up the players who want to be sexed up rock on

8317964 more and more of the tracks are all in agreement somewhere between houston and new orleans were going to have a problem thats the heart of the platforms and theyre still saying category 3 or higher
8317965 we see it close to galveston by monday or tuesday night
8317966 depending on the way it takes tomorrow they are going to make a decision whether to evacuate the platforms either friday or saturday
8317967 it was the same way with ronald reagan in the last few years he was president
8317968 the deception included conducting performances with an oxygen tube in his nose and telling audiences he had broken bones and other unexplained symptoms
8317969 he sat back in his chair and he took a puff out of his cigar
8317970 he said oh youre young youll grow out of it he had no idea that he spoke death into my life that shut me down because i thought well someday ill grow out instead i grew in and i grew in deep
8317971 i tried to go to sleep that night and it was literally like a drug calling me

8317981 the power and the story how the crafted presidential narrative has determined political success from george washington to george w bush
8317982 you start out with almost an anti intellectual strain there i want someone whos like me so they can understand me and know what i need government to be doing
8317983 to have a bad bowling score is good people see you as human
8317984 no matter how educated you are how successful you are you still need to be just folks

8317987 the girl who voted for hillary and didnt get asked to the prom
8317988 its how you show how you feel that is the most important
8317989 i havent let you down before and i wont let you down now
8317990 what we do on some great occasions will probably depend upon what we already are and what we are will be the result of previous years of self discipline
8317991 few people think more than two or three times a year i have made an international reputation for myself by thinking once or twice a week
8317992 bobby your problem is youve mastered the game of golf but you havent mastered your emotions and until you master your emotions youll never be a champion in golf

8317996 seduce clients into borrowing more than their repayment capacity allows
8317997 already starting to shun risky innovations and less attractive markets in favor of immediate profitability and a safer portfolio
8317998 this means that just about all financial ngos should be audited by the government
8317999 has decided to enter a more upscale market but senior managers argue that this involves the addition of new markets not subtraction from the original focus
8318000 rapid growth and large size have forced bancosol to revise its original organizational design

8318006 let us train our minds to desire what the situation demands
8318007 confident that the transition to a free and open democracy is being made
8318008 community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage
8318009 so that were not just teaching to a test and crowding out programs like art and music

8318011 ahmadinejad is the right person to meet with right now
8318012 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8318013 my superiors were not happy the local bishop was not happy but they did not understand me either
8318014 the fault may not be with the targeting however the advertising may be very relevant to those who see it rather the problem might be that the ads are served up to people at an inappropriate time in an inappropriate place for example even though my profile suggests that i am interested in kayaking that does not mean i want to stop and check out a new boat while im in the middle of looking at photos of my buddys latest paddling trip in this respect advertisers may be reaching the right person with the right message but is it the right time
8318015 while argyria occurred more commonly before the development of antibiotics it is now a rare occurrence
8318016 it says silver can kill 620 pathogens thats a great statement but the real question is at what level over what period of time and using what type of solution since theres hundreds of different types of solution silver can do it yeah but unless you have the knowledge behind it of how to utilise it its useless
8318017 silver can do this silver can do that they will never say my silver product can do this the reason why is because they have no data on it they dont know that their product will do something
8318018 we have done a great deal of work the first one we tested at 200 times the normal adult dosage that is equivalent to me sitting down and taking 32 ounces at one sitting at that level it was deemed completely non toxic to the test animals
8318019 tiefer tiefer irgendwo in der tiefe gibt es ein licht
8318020 we dont have a diesel shortage in a typical sense the oil marketing companies are pumping 25 more into chennai than what we did during same time last year therefore we can safely state that there is no shortage the problem is that our retail infrastructure is equipped to handle only the transportation segment
8318021 i have a theory about music that most peoples favorite music is centered around the period when they were children and teen agers not that people dont like other eras but that their era is the music they always come back to and most enjoy do you agree or disagree
8318022 we had a lot of problems with the bike early in the year but now we seem to have these sorted out
8318023 the balance shaft was not set properly and the engine was breaking bearings

8318031 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8318032 theres a strong chance that by friday we could see some fairly significant pump price increases
8318033 crude can be replaced and brought in via tanker but bringing a damaged refinery back up again can take a long time as we saw with katrina and rita
8318034 were getting some pretty powerful data that suggests slower growth and higher gasoline prices have really crimped oil demand in the u s
8318035 i think gustav is overshadowing the eia report it doesnt appear to having an impact
8318036 for too long the teles narrative has been written by its critics who describe a paper that hasnt existed for years
8318037 they see it as a screaming aggressive ill informed london style red top but that paper exists only in the imaginations of people like the sydney morning herald journalist david marr or any of the other fairfax people who have had the honour of presenting the abc tv program media watch
8318038 you cant break as many stories as we have and be completely stupid and the tele breaks a lot of stories the broadsheet papers would kill for
8318039 col turned up the volume at the telegraph and made it such a politically important paper
8318040 but a lot of the perceptions of it as being a bit over the top go back to that more strident era
8318041 weve turned the volume down a bit were not banging the clenched fist on the table were a bit more constructive and a bit more thoughtful
8318042 id just like to defy global trends and sell more papers
8318043 i struggle to see how you can do that without affecting quality
8318044 people want choice they want the opportunity to be as green as they can
8318045 i actually think its inevitable twenty20 cricket will be an olympic sport
8318046 you think about the audiences in the sub continent 22 or 23 per cent of the worlds population is based in that area
8318047 the ioc could do a lot worse than put cricket into the olympics
8318048 the critical issue with the game of twenty20 cricket is how do we make it work
8318049 the reason i say that is not because i want to go off and play its not about that
8318050 i want to play for australia as much as i can i want to play as many tests for australia as i can
8318051 i want the next generation of australian players to have that dream to put on the baggy green cap and play 100 test matches and 300 one day games
8318052 im worried if theres not that period of time be it in the ipl or the epl or whatever competition it might be that this next generations opinions might change
8318053 they might see the dollars and think maybe its more appealing to me that i go and play ipl instead of playing for my country
8318054 if we are working on the basis of our mutual interests then its logical to implement this agreement
8318055 this is an old way of doing things that has nothing to do with modern realities
8318056 primarily i think the u s was looking for things to take away and penalize russia for in georgia
8318057 this is a vote of no confidence in improving u s russian relations
8318058 no name in cricket conjures up such widespread awe and respect as that of sir donald bradman
8318059 even people with just a passing knowledge of the game or in countries where he never played will invariably recognise the name bradman as a byword for brilliance
8318060 that name says all that is best about the game and it is synonymous with cricket
8318061 even now 60 years after his final test match and with time to put his achievements into context his batting average of 99 94 still seems scarcely believable especially when one compares it to those of the many other players to have graced the game at the highest level
8318062 cricket is all about tradition and respecting previous generations and i am sure rickys speech will do just that as well as being a fitting tribute to a truly great cricket person
8318063 in this historic political year we will be bringing our unique independent perspective and analysis to the convention

8318152 he has been a solid advocate for sensible gun laws that protect our police officers and our families i was proud to stand with him just weeks ago in philadelphia when he joined with our nations mayors in supporting tough crime fighting laws and also last year when police leaders urged passage of common sense measures to protect law enforcement officers our nation would be well served with joe biden as our vice president

8318315 stated that in the new organization he would have reported to the associate deputy minister of the ministry of aeel
8318316 was appointed to his position in aeel without competition as he saw no advertisement for it that would normally be required for an appointment in the classified service
8318317 as mr walker was a senior staff member too she asked about his status and mr emsley indicated mr walker did not have the confidence of government either but was not on the list at that time ms young told mr emsley that she had concerns about the timing with regard to all the dismissals in the ministry and the need to proceed with building the new management team so mr emsley added mr walker to the list
8318318 she met with mr garnet garven deputy minister to the premier to discuss the implications of terminating the employment of an individual on secondment and it was agreed between them that termination of employment also ended the secondment
8318319 while specific dismissals may be thought to be in the short term interests of a particular government this cannot be in the broader long term public service interest

8318323 la polic a de manera permanente se capacita en el procedimiento en los derechos fundamentales y en las garant as y yo estoy absolutamente seguro de que las cosas se hacen bien
8318324 aqu hay un sistema judicial y unas normas que se deben respetar pero desafortunadamente a veces esas argucias esos argumentos y de pronto esos vac os que existen en el tema de la interpretaci n y sobre todo tambi n en el criterio que tienen los jueces de garant as pues desafortunadamente los responsables no son castigados y la gente en un momento de desespero son capaces de hacer cualquier cosa
8318325 yo no encuentro error de procedimiento porque a este individuo se captura despu s de que abandona la unidad permanente de justicia y a la unidad permanente de justicia se llev por parte de la polic a precisamente para asegurarnos que ese delincuente no siguiera constituy ndose en una amenaza para la comunidad mientras que se surt a la orden de captura

8318340 i told him you know drew there arent many guys who would admit a peanut shell could do the job
8318341 what i love about the show is the unpredictability of dancing with the stars its all about being reactive to what goes on and between the contestants and judges i have an embarrassment of riches
8318342 when drew said that on the show it was like a big grapefruit out there just waiting for me to hit it out of the ballpark
8318343 i got a lovely spotted dick i put it in out it comes its flat and collapsed and thats a bit like your dancing
8318344 this is going to be a small intimate show and its special

8318356 hes a big strong physical guy and hes mechanically sound said milwaukee gm doug melvin
8318357 and in the short time weve gotten to know him weve seen how competitive he is
8318358 whats tough is when you have those innings with over 20 pitches melvin said
8318359 thats when the wear and tear sets in and you dont have a chance to recover

8318381 she never really answered the key question is he prepared to be president which is the issue she put out there rather dramatically during the primaries

8318383 i saw millions of people across the country working as one to elect the next democratic president
8318384 certainly some measures of precaution are being taken lets hope we do not see any direct confrontation in that
8318385 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aid using battleships

8318387 china is concerned about the latest development in south ossetia and abkhazia
8318388 the military forces which have not yet pulled back to the lines they held before the hostilities must move without delay
8318389 which aims to unilaterally change the borders of georgia is quite simply unacceptable
8318390 clear commitment from the eu that it will continue to stand by georgia and the same applies for our membership of nato
8318391 we have the biggest gap between the rich and everybody else since the
8318392 output per hour or productivity rose 2 5 percent per year during the 2000 to 2007 cycle compared to 2 percent in the 1990s when fared much better the economy expanded in the 2000s but that growth clearly failed to reach most households a dynamic that implicates growing income inequality the fact that these disappointing income poverty and earnings trends occurred in the context of strong productivity growth is a reminder that in todays economy productivity growth creates only the potential for higher living standards as long as most workers lack the to claim their share of the growth they have helped to generate that potential will not be realized
8318393 the improvement in in 2007 was due to more americans obtaining coverage through programs principally medicare and medicaid
8318394 the 12 5 percent rate in 2007 compares to 11 3 percent in 2000 it is unprecedented that poverty is higher at this point in an and the damage from the failure of the economys growth to lift more people out of poverty is huge if the 2007 poverty rate were just the same as in 2000 approximately six million fewer americans would have lived in poverty in 2007 all signs are that the poverty rate will be driven higher in 2008 by a slowing economy and skyrocketing costs for housing energy and food
8318395 the data for 2007 are of particular concern given that the economy is now in a slowdown and poverty is almost certainly higher now and incomes lower than in 2007
8318396 the 2007 levels are likely to constitute a high water mark for the next few years
8318397 when the data become available for 2008 the picture will undoubtedly grow more grim
8318398 average real weekly earnings are down 2 4 percent so far this year according to the
8318399 we will hear a lot this fall from presidential and congressional candidates about their vision for americas economic future a reinvigorated fight against hunger and poverty must be an essential part of this vision
8318400 so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
8318401 in addition increases in the frequency of spanking are associated with increased odds of abuse and mothers who report spanking on the buttocks with an object such as a belt or a switch are nine times more likely to report abuse compared to mothers who report no spanking
8318402 this study demonstrated for the first time that parents who report spanking children with an object and parents who frequently spank children are much more likely to report other harsh punishment acts consistent with physical abuse
8318403 these national rankings reflect the quality accessibility affordability and diversity of a suny education

8318419 we issued shoot on sight orders in the wake of large scale violence
8318420 this is unprecedented violence much more widespread than weve ever seen
8318421 the violence against the christian community in orissa state which broke out after the reprehensible assassination
8318422 so far a total of nine persons have been killed in various incidents
8318423 certainly some measures of precaution are being taken lets hope we do not see any direct confrontation in that

8318430 the economic environment continued to negatively impact mobile phones sales in both mature and emerging markets
8318431 replacement sales remained weak as consumers faced higher prices for fuel and food in addition to higher levels of inflation
8318432 the location of the 40 40 club will enable our guests to access a very special race and sports book and restaurant environment in the palazzo
8318433 by adding a gaming component to the24 000 square foot space we will be able to create an unique environment for our guests
8318434 we shall soon be setting up a government the mdc does not want to come in apparently
8318435 this time they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating that in six months time the government will collapse
8318436 i do not know when that day will come i wish mdc leader morgan tsvangirai well on that day
8318437 its very clear that if he announces the new cabinet its a declaration of war against the people you cant just have a cabinet without a mandate
8318438 he should wait for the conclusion of the dialogue together with the mdc and mr tsvangirai on the way forward otherwise what he is doing is a recipe for disaster
8318439 the talks have not been formally terminated so the natural conclusion is that the talks are on
8318440 but there hasnt been any formal communication from sadc from president mbeki to say this is the way forward
8318441 we are actually looking forward to the conclusion of the dialogue when mugabe and mdc leader morgan tsvangirai form a transitional government
8318442 he is now left with limited options and is faced with signs of disunity within his zanu pf members
8318443 mugabe is a skilled political warhorse who has done so much to buy time for his term in power he can only lose through talks
8318444 it was my idea to use barack obamas name i am going to be the same as that guy initially everybody thought it was a joke but now instead of alexandre theyre calling me barack
8318445 provide some encouraging evidence that price pressures in the eurozones largest economy are beginning to recede
8318446 million dollar question is whether the inflation beast is now really tamed or just taking a short breather
8318447 nearly all depends on the oil price in the months to come
8318448 if the price of oil remains at around its current level in the coming months or even falls further the peak of inflation is likely to be behind us for the time being
8318449 an encouraging sign that petrol and heating oil suppliers are passing the fall in the oil price on to consumers very quickly
8318450 it is much too soon to breath a sigh of relief
8318451 early signs of easing price pressures support our view that the bank ecb will be free to start cutting interest rates early next year
8318452 whats happened has happened theres no use crying about it
8318453 well go there next weekend i love that circuit id love to race there all year long

8318456 it does seem that the street circuits havent been favourable to me in four races ive only claimed one point in melbourne in a race i didnt manage to finish because of an engine failure
8318457 then there was the incident with adrian sutil in monaco and hamilton crashing into me at the exit to the pit lane in montreal
8318458 hey redacted tumblrcrush meet you in the supply closet in 5 minutes
8318459 for far too long american counterterrorism planners fbi agents and cia and dod national security defense analysts have taken as their number one priority the task of refining their incident management techniques for combating todays terrorism
8318460 the war on terror label is particularly inappropriate for the conflict in iraq
8318461 on average there are close to 20 000 murders of innocent people in america each year
8318462 president bush signed a 417 5 billion defense appropriations bill for the fiscal year 2005
8318463 enthusiasm for martyrdom persists as long as there is a reasonable chance that it will lead to victory sacrifice must have a purpose
8318464 we are really puzzled to see americans and their followers in the western world think that they are able to confront people who wish to die more than they the americans want to live
8318465 majority of madrasahs actually present an opportunity not a threat
8318466 to establish a just peace not simply the absence of war and to allow non combatants to live free of strife
8318467 they see themselves as exempt from ordinary moral rules because the population they claim to protect is so abused and because god is on their side
8318468 in assuming itself to be above the law the bush administration has made a serious moral error
8318469 the continental us has 95 000 miles of coastline 429 commercial airports with 30 000 daily flights serviced by a fleet of 6 800 us commercial aircraft 200 000 private aircraft 361 commercial seaports and 104 nuclear power plants
8318470 waging physical war against militant jihadis by itself will only enhance their recruitment efforts
8318471 must devise a better way to win the war of ideas involved in the fight against terrorism
8318472 after the june 23 1998 mri defendant dr eduardo orihuela informed the plaintiff that the mri showed a small mass on the plaintiffs right kidney and that he dr orihuela had diagnosed this small mass as being right call carcinoma but the alleged tumor was benign
8318473 pain humiliation extreme emotional distress psychological and post traumatic stress
8318474 the defendants obviously saw the benefit in olas idea but they apparently didnt think they needed the companys permission to use its patents or to honor their confidentiality agreements
8318475 its hard for me to believe that these huge companies didnt know what they were doing when they basically copied our clients process verbatim and collaborated to market it themselves
8318476 the proposed representatives must be more than just shell plaintiffs controlled entirely by plaintiffs attorneys
8318477 appears nowhere on any of the documents the plaintiffs are asked to sign during the purchase of the home
8318478 extremely broad general releases releasing and discharging defendants from all claims
8318479 at best limited knowledge of the nature of their claims or the alleged facts underlying those claims
8318480 thats through my lawyers im not answering i mean i dont know nothing about that
8318481 more or less yesterday when it was explained to me what it was all dealing with

8318483 but standing in this building feeling the enthusiasm dont you think republicans have something to worry about
8318484 no i think republicans are very heartened by this convention everything seems to have not gone the way they have planned it
8318485 the fact is yesterday bill clinton set up this equation that only bill clinton could do about candidate y and candidate x i dont know if you heard that he said candidate y is somebody you agree with completely but dont think is prepared to be president and candidate x is somebody you agree with half the time but is prepared who would you vote for
8318486 let me ask you this question because as your convention comes up next week in the twin cities and
8318487 i noted that she did not answer the major question that shes raised about barack obama shes the one who said during the primary that hes not prepared to be president of the united states as joe biden did and nowhere in that speech did she answer that question about his character his ability to lead
8318488 i have to say hillary clinton had a very funny line about that you cant tell them apart george bush and john mccain twins just like the twin cities
8318489 if our brand is at that site we will be supplying the gas
8318490 as the oil companies exit we think there will be more flexibility
8318491 we know it s going to head into the gulf after that we re not sure where it s heading
8318492 for that reason everyone in gulf needs to be monitoring the storm at that point we re expecting it to be a category 3 hurricane
8318493 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8318494 my instinct is it will be a really wet night
8318495 they were all members of a family that had taken shelter since tropical storm fay and left to go home because they thought the danger had passed
8318496 how do display a character normal mapping bump mapping shadows
8318497 holy sh t thats the look that weve been talking about
8318498 thats working but its time to do something new because its been five years
8318499 what americans really want is a president that they can easily make fun of
8318500 in a yearlong review of levee work here the associated press has tracked a pattern of public misperception political jockeying and legal fighting along with economic and engineering miscalculations since katrina that threaten to make new orleans the scene of another devastating flood
8318501 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
8318502 please fox news give me a reason to vote against obama that doesnt include the word black
8318503 please please give me a reason to vote for the person who says that things are all right after all

8318554 joining our main cast are some fantastic guest artists who will only add to making this unmissable tv
8318555 it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as it is great and fantastic

8318558 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride
8318559 this series is one big serial and the most ambitious story weve ever made and weve got plenty of surprises in store
8318560 we dont live in a democracy we live in a republic
8318561 in order to make up the difference we must achieve a city wide water use reduction of approximately 20 percent
8318562 we have already slashed water usage by 20 percent for landscape and lighting districts local parks and city property and were continuing to monitor and correct any overflow problems in those areas
8318563 we are hoping that residents will recognize the seriousness of the drought and comply voluntarily
8318564 unfortunately the current circumstances require that we move beyond recommendations and impose some requirements
8318565 the last time i was here i was performing at the grand which is always fantastic and i actually performed as the invisible man
8318566 i really love coming to the old place because the people are fantastic and they are always so enthusiastic theres been a doctor who museum here for years and the love for the show around here is amazing
8318567 hes bringing a real new lease of life to the role and i think hes
8318568 its a real pleasure to have such a living legend here
8318569 hes a massive part of doctor who history and hes a lovely guy to boot
8318570 if what i was doing is directly affecting morale or that i cause the morale problem id see that

8318573 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8318574 did not answer the major question that shes raised about barack obama
8318575 shes the one who said during the primary that hes not prepared to be president of the united states as joe biden did and nowhere in that speech did she answer that question about his character his ability to lead the things that are really at issue here

8318580 hope in the face of difficulty hope in the face of uncertainty the audacity of hope
8318581 i think there is no doubt that people are disturbed by the direction of the bush administration
8318582 i think that democrats i talk to feel that there is as much at stake in this election as there has ever been
8318583 there were people who supported the war and people who opposed the war inside that convention hall
8318584 but what people are unified about is that when we make a decision to go to war that it should not be ideologically driven that it should be driven by a set of facts and common sense with regards to how we mobilize our country and our national interest
8318585 and i think that there is a strong feeling that even among those that supported george bushs decision initially to go in
8318586 that there was some fudging of the numbers and shading of the truth and that as a consequence of our inability to create a strong alliance around our actions that we are now stuck in a quagmire that is going to cost us not only billion of dollars but thousands of lives and will require a much longer term commitment than the american voters had intended when they rallied behind the president
8318587 even our older players can find out very quickly how important it is to be consistent
8318588 you cant rest on experience you cant rest on hey ive been here you better play and you better perform

8318600 empresas de comunicaci n privadas que siempre buscan distorsionar las cifras u omitirlas
8318601 los comerciantes alegan que las empresas que generan los tickets les cobran comisiones que van desde 4 2 hasta 7 por eso aumentan los precios de los alimentos
8318602 ese monto es excesivo para los comercios peque os que tienen que vender alimentos declarados de primera necesidad y sometidos al control de precios cuyos m rgenes de ganancias son peque os
8318603 hay mucho ticket de alimentaci n circulante y con estos porcentajes tan altos se est afectando el suministro de los alimentos de primera necesidad
8318604 tenemos que intervenir para poder establecer en principio acuerdos para que en aquellos establecimientos peque os donde tienen altas comisiones stas se reduzcan para que el comercio no tenga la necesidad de cargar a los usuarios del ticket con aumento en los precios incluso de productos regulados
8318605 hemos propuesto que ellos reduzcan la comisi n a los comerciantes sobre todo a los peque os los que est n en los barrios los comerciantes que obtienen pocos beneficios poco margen de ganancia
8318606 esto es urgente porque se est generalizando se est agudizando sobre todo ahora porque estamos siendo estrictos en relaci n a la regulaci n y en aquellos casos en los que vamos a proceder a multar a los establecimientos que le recarguen a los usuarios lo que va a pasar es que algunos comercios no van a aceptar los tickets y se va a generar un problema en el abastecimiento

8318615 last summer we stayed at the wynn for what seemed like a lifetime close to three weeks
8318616 we met at a banquet we got to talking and she really understands the game
8318617 i told her id make a deal with her that if we won the gold medal id give it to her she thought i was kidding but i told her i had one already and the way they treated us at the wynn it was the least i could do
8318618 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8318619 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8318620 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8318621 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight

8318623 we received a report of a very bad assault that might well be a homicide
8318624 theres a considerable degree of evidence that leads us to believe this likely is a homicide but we have not recovered any remains at this point in time

8318629 this is an excellent start to the year for the nhs
8318630 a strong financial position backed by good progress on delivery will continue to ensure high quality services for patients
8318631 this forecast surplus begs the question whether taxpayers money is being used effectively
8318632 what evidence is there that trusts are using their surpluses to prepare for fluctuations in demand and investment in new services is this the nhs preparing for a period of slower growth in funding or is this individual trusts building up a surplus so that they can survive in a more competitive environment
8318633 several reports have shown that the current funding system risks damaging quality in the nhs but has done nothing to improve efficiency
8318634 ministers should focus on sorting this out rather than patting themselves on the back for allowing the nhs to bank more and more cash
8318635 there continue to be hospitals whose finances are far from stable as we can see from the number of primary care trusts who are rationing access to medicines

8318646 a fire broke out in the military depot near the town of lozovaya we are taking steps to localise the blaze the size of which we are checking
8318647 between the uncertainty surrounding the closure of the temporary shelters and the inability or reluctance of refugees to reintegrate into local communities the preferred solution for a growing number of them is to return to their countries of origin
8318648 i am exercising my right to seek voluntary repatriation and have registered my whole family with unhcr
8318649 its better than going back to a community that doesnt want you
8318650 i eventually gave up and started working as a trader and that is what has sustained my family
8318651 will the army and the police be there to look after us 24 hours a day

8318653 we know that this xenophobic violence was perpetrated by a few people and that the vast majority of south africans are against it unfortunately we cannot rely on the government forever life must go on and for me that life is in the drc
8318654 sometimes i think i am close to losing my mind
8318655 i came here because a man of my age who is in the mountains will be suspected of being a rebel
8318656 i had an onion garden five kilometres south of iferouane
8318657 during combat in november 2007 i fled with a camel herder
8318658 i am upset now that my parents never put me in school but i know they needed me at home to help
8318659 and as a tuareg i know that anytime there is an explosion or combat no matter how far away people look at me with suspicion
8318660 we need money and logistical help to fight the disease we dont have enough beds or medicines at the moment to do it
8318661 the situation is beyond our control people must respect the laws that have been laid down and the government must do more to control the situation
8318662 we have found people are not cooperating enough to abide by the hygiene measures imposed by health authorities
8318663 we have to come together to contribute to the fight against the epidemic that is wreaking havoc in our capital
8318664 my greatest birthday present was my cd4 count reaching 500
8318665 before i knew about my hiv status i used to be very sick with skin rashes on and off fevers cough and diarrhoea
8318666 by 10 years of age i had had seven hospital admissions for severe pneumonia i had also had tb tuberculosis and meningitis
8318667 everything was okay until i went to boarding school two years later
8318668 children ask questions they ask about the skin rash why i go to hospital
8318669 i could not adhere to my treatment regimen because of fear of being seen taking the drugs
8318670 the drugs i was taking changed and now there were seven or eight tablets a day they were difficult to swallow
8318671 i thank those who are helping children to give us life
8318672 before i joined the group apart from other people stigmatising me i also used to have a lot of self stigma because of what i have gone through
8318673 but in the club we learn many things how to face challenges and get solutions how to deal with stigma and discrimination at home at school and in the community
8318674 i am also helping other children to cope with their hiv status and stigma
8318675 on 22nd july on top of cutting a cake i got the greatest birthday present ever my cd4 count was 500 for the first time

8318702 wij kunnen de huidige versie dus niet met de destijds toegezonden demo vergelijken alle demos die niet door de selectie komen worden direct na het beluisteren vernietigd
8318703 het feit dat de persoon in kwestie via internet en op andere wijze het gerucht verspreidt dat hij ook maar iets te maken zou hebben met het ontstaan van elements of life zonder dit via een offici le instantie als buma stemra aanhangig te maken geeft wel aan hoe veel vertrouwen hij in zijn eigen zaak heeft

8318727 i heard firing in the morning and did not dare to come out i dont know how many are they the army people helped us to vacate the place
8318728 the police had called at my house that morning before i left for work asking whether i knew where jill and chris were whether they were on holiday but they gave no indication what had happened
8318729 when i asked they said thered been a bit of damage done at the house and they needed to contact them the officers seemed quite jolly and upbeat but at the same time i was uneasy it was in the back of my mind all day and i kept trying jills number
8318730 when i got home and i saw a neighbour come across with her husband i was gripped with dread i couldnt believe what she was telling me the police called later and said they still dont know where the family is
8318731 they wont be able to go into the house for a couple of days because its unsafe due to the extent of the fire the waiting is killing me
8318732 they loved that house they moved there about four or five years ago and although it needed a lot doing to it they fell in love with the place
8318733 chris got in contractors and completely overhauled the place it was like a mini mansion he put in a lake and was in the process of putting in another hed planted trees and wild flowers and made a wood
8318734 kirstie is horse mad and so is jill theyd filled the place with animals theyd got sheep horses dogs ducks guinea pigs special breeds of chickens jill even had an incubator and hatched out some duck eggs herself this year
8318735 for chriss 50th birthday this year she got him three sheep as his present thats how they were
8318736 despite the occasion we had an enjoyable time together i went back to the house afterwards and spent a couple of hours with them we walked round the grounds together
8318737 the house a garage and stable block and another outbuilding were severely damaged two horses in the stable and another in the outbuilding have been found dead two dogs which we believe were in a kennel block are missing
8318738 a search will be carried out of the property to establish if anybody was inside as soon as the building is deemed to be safe
8318739 the occupants of the house have not been accounted for and we are appealing for mr foster mrs foster and kirstie to get in touch if they are out there

8318778 faith leads a man to look to god for help in his ordinary avocation
8318779 david was a great warrior and he attributed his valour to god who taught his hands to war and his fingers to fight we read of bezaleel and of the women that were wise hearted that god had taught them so that they made all manner of embroidery and metal work for the house of the lord in those days they used to reckon skill and invention to be the gifts of god this wretched century has grown too wise to honour any god but its own idolized self if you pray over your work i am persuaded you will be helped in it if for your calling you are as yet but slenderly qualified you may every morning pray god to help you that you may be careful and observant as an apprentice or a beginner for has he not promised that as your day your strength shall be a mind which is trusting in the lord is in the best condition for acquiring knowledge and getting understanding
8318780 as to your behaviour also in your work there is room for faith and prayer
8318781 how can i do this great wickedness and sin against god
8318782 faith bids you seek help from god as to the success of your daily calling know ye not what david says except the lord build the house they labour in vain that build it it is vain for you to rise up early to sit up late to eat the bread of sorrows for so he giveth his beloved sleep it is a most pleasant thing to be able by faith to consult the holy oracle about everything whether it arises in trade or in the family or in the church we may say with abrahams servant o lord i pray thee send me good speed this day you may expect success if you thus seek it and peradventure some of you would have prospered more if you had more believingly sought the lord i say peradventure because god does not always prosper even his own people in outward things since it is sometimes better for their souls that they should be in adversity and then the highest prosperity is a want of prosperity faith quiets the heart in this matter by enabling us to leave results in the hand of god
8318783 faith acts also in reference to our surroundings we are all very much influenced by those about us god can raise us up friends who will be eminently helpful to us and we may pray him to do so he can put us into a circle of society in which we shall find much assistance in this lifes affairs and also in our progress towards heaven and concerning this we know that the steps of a good man are ordered of the lord faith will keep you clear of evil company and constrain you to seek the society of the excellent of this earth and thus it will colour your whole life if there be no friends to help him the believers dependence is so fixed upon god that he goes forward in cheerful confidence knowing that the lord alone is sufficient for him yet if he be encouraged and assisted by friends he looks upon it as gods doing as much as when david was strengthened by those who came to him in the cave
8318784 a judge ruled monday that a defendant had willfully and intentionally destroyed evidence of his p2p activities after being notified of pending legal action by the riaa
8318785 furthermore since it was done in bad faith it therefore warrants appropriate sanctions
8318786 after that ruling it appeared as though atlantic v howell was headed for a bench trial this fall
8318787 according to the riaas brief howell destroyed evidence on four separate occasions after first receiving the prelitigation settlement letter and later being served with the lawsuit
8318788 come to think of it jammie thomas the first defendant to go to trial in the riaas campaign against file sharers was also

8318813 in any event the road was practically deserted at this hour only the clop of my horses hooves the creak of the harness the rumbling of my stomach and the cries of the distant birds broke the morning stillness which meant that minus me and my horse all you would hear were the birds and if you hunted those down and killed them you would achieve a scene of perfect silence if thats what you looked for in scenes

8318818 my role or the function that is my life is music i make music and collaborate with creative people it is a great thing i am surrounded by talent people who dont need to depend on each other but believe in each other and support that belief we all work hard and help each other succeed
8318819 dear i just want to thank you for everything you did for me there is no way i could ever repay you 1 mary had a little pig
8318820 well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
8318821 a real smart racer explained it to me this way after he wrecked me and i was real mad
8318822 the first one was definitely unexpected and a bit of shock
8318823 in 03 i think it all came a bit too soon
8318824 when we came out of the end of the year and we had won a championship i dont think we knew what wed actually achieved and now knowing what goes into it and the rewards that go to the guys and everybody who helps thats the biggest part of it
8318825 if we do win a championship it would mean a ton more than 03 i think
8318826 the drought seasons in 04 and 05 definitely make you respect things a lot more feel gifted in that you have the opportunity
8318827 so anytime you even win a race you thrive on it a little more
8318828 i think you definitely get recognized a lot more especially in indy which is where i live
8318829 theres such a history there and people love that race
8318830 i think if helio wins the next two races we just have to place fourth so we should be able to do that
8318831 we just have to stay behind him were ok we have a long way to go yet
8318832 i guess we just need to shrug it off and come back strong next week
8318833 we just need to keep doing what weve been doing all year and well be fine
8318834 in terms of this season i think everything that hes done and weve had success together in the past is the result of all of those years of working hard day by day
8318835 its not something that just fell into place its his experience level all the things that hes managed to gather up in his data bank of experience is paying large dividends
8318836 with his ability to adapt his driving style to the racetracks that we have today in this series hes at the right place at the right time with the right team i think we were on the edge of it last year and i think his experience the whole last year was just at the point where it was starting to work well but this year scotts really been able to capitalize on that
8318837 its the same people and theyre obviously doing the same things that they were and maybe its a combination of all the small things have probably come through a little better
8318838 last year we were decent i think we just werent aggressive enough in the first part of the season and thats where we lost a lot of it and had to try and pull it back with six races to go
8318839 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
8318840 isnt there another way cant i reason with the child
8318841 we are confident that wal mart stores will be among the greenest on the block

8318843 that perspective misses the point our focus on sustainability is as beneficial to our business as it is to the environment for wal mart there is no distinction between environmental sustainability and business sustainability its the same thing

8318895 dies ist wahrscheinlich die am santeste professionellste und problemloseste tour die ich in meinem leben je mitgemacht habe
8318896 i think that this is time for unity in this country and maybe it is time to have a guy like john mccain a republican on the ticket with a guy he does like they do get along and they dont have fundamental disagreements on major policies
8318897 it is true political problems are not solved by love and mercy but the world of politics is not the only world and unless political decisions rest on a foundation of something better and higher than politics they can never do any real good for men when a country has to be rebuilt after war the passions and energies of war are no longer enough there must be a new force the power of love the power of understanding and human compassion the strength of selflessness and cooperation and the creative dynamism of the will to live and to build and the will to forgive the will for reconciliation

8318900 we wanted to give them an opportunity to play at wembley as part of that education
8318901 weve had superb attendances around the country to see the under 21s and from what the players have achieved this campaign they deserve to play in front of a big crowd at wembley
8318902 with tickets priced very sensibly hopefully we will get plenty of people there to see what should be an exciting game against formidable opposition

8318914 most of the music venues in the city are 21 plus so i never get to go to any of them
8318915 they get to go out to these bars and meet all these other musicians but i have to find other ways to spend my time i get a lot of practicing in by myself
8318916 its really no different from just hanging out with a bunch of friends except you play nintendo instead of drink or some people do both
8318917 its a good conversation starter too someone new always comes over and thinks it looks stupid but eventually theyll be wearing a sweatband and playing the wii tennis game as into it as any of us
8318918 theres just something about all the buttons on controllers that really turn people away
8318919 but the wii controls are really intuitive so its inviting to everyone

8318922 the main theme of warner was work together to solve problems
8318923 mccain has a long record of doing that barack obama doesnt
8318924 she agrees with him on the issues she didnt say last night that he was prepared
8318925 but hes not ready to lead the united states of america
8318926 yes but he may need to work on energy and taxes two economic issues that have been the target of several recent mccain ads obama has a comfortable eight point edge on economic issues overall 51 to 43 percent
8318927 but the mccain ads may have come with a cost half the public thinks mccain has attacked his opponent unfairly while only a third feel that way about obama
8318928 neither candidate scores well on that measure and the conventions are the first and best chance to present clear solutions to current problems
8318929 photographers deal in things which are continually vanishing and when they have vanished there is no contrivance on earth which can make them come back again

8318940 my form isnt so good out there after just getting back from beijing and it just shows how need such a strong team behind you
8318941 they rode today like always and i think we have shown for a while now how strong we are as a team
8318942 i cant climb worth anything i cant get over a bump in the road i thought i could get them on the descent but they must have really been tapping through up there
8318943 i knew that garmin and columbia would be going hard i was really hoping that there would have been a few more guys that came along with us and give us a good chance of staying away
8318944 ive got a strong team here so im sure theyll help me defend it
8318945 the categorized climbs werent so hard it was the rolling terrain after the last categorized climb where it got really really tricky
8318946 the peloton split and i actually got dropped from the front group at one point bernie eisel had to drop back for me

8318948 now no one is saying that nuns cant be beautiful but i was thinking about something more complete

8318955 the law exists to protect the young from harm or being exposed to harm in this case both boys were made to take part in the ritual flagellation and suffered injuries to their backs
8318956 we are satisfied that given the age of the children involved the coercion employed by syed mustafa zaidi who did not accept that he was wrong and the possibility of such an incident occurring again the decision to prosecute was the correct one

8318966 playing like this was a new thing for us which i really enjoyed
8318967 if you have a band you might as well utilize it and play like a band this time it very much had the feeling of a group of people playing together
8318968 thats one thing that is a very big difference between alopecia and anything before it
8318969 i started writing consciously in rhyme schemes where before that i would just write the ideas in a raw form and then would later find the natural rhyme scheme
8318970 you have to always question whether the rhyme is driving you or not or whether its just an added bonus because it sounds interesting someone like shakespeare hes never driven by the rhyme
8318971 doesnt it just seem like the end of the world
8318972 we have a romanticized view of what a stockmans life is like a man from snowy river view and i wanted to present life in a stock camp as it really is in all its grittiness
8318973 the main complaint about the book relates to the occasional use of strong language
8318974 there is in fact only a minimal amount of strong language in requiem for a beast and this is intended to reflect the language often used by australian stockmen
8318975 one only has to flick through the young adult books in bookstores to realize that the use of language in requiem for a beast is mild by comparison with many other works for older teens and adults
8318976 detractors ask if we really want to read profanity and racist dialogue in our childrens books
8318977 but this is an insidious question what can the reasonable answer be except no but this of course masks the real issue that ugliness exists that racism violence and ignorance are real and books especially fiction are still the best vehicles for exploring ideas
8318978 i am disdainful of any parents apathy in not taking 10 minutes to review a picture books appropriateness for their own children
8318979 it doesnt matter where you start in life what counts is where you decide to finish
8318980 oh i wish i had done my high school diploma

8318982 last month i have visited an old friend of mine

8318989 marcus wareing is emerging from ramsays shadow as the proprietor of what is now clearly the best restaurant in london
8318990 it is hardly surprising than an impassioned individual concentrating on one establishment such as marcus wareing has overtaken the flagship of an ever more celebrity driven empire where the name chef is rarely present
8318991 it is the disappointing standards at ramsays three most recent mass market openings which are most immediately concerning each of them the warrington devonshire house and foxtrot oscar is nominated in roughly one in every three of the survey reports they attract in the most disappointing meal of the year category these newcomers are so uninspired in concept and so erratic in performance that if they were opened by independent operators they would likely be closed within a year
8318992 what he urgently needs to do is to stop chasing media attention across the globe and to start putting some real effort into improving standards at the restaurants in his london heartland
8318993 we are very proud of the huge success of p trus which was opened by grh in march 1999 and as a company we have been instrumental in continually raising its game to help it evolve into the restaurant that it is today
8318994 grh have taken the one and two top spots in the current hardens guide which is surely cause for plaudits rather than the inevitably negative spin that the guides editors have chosen in order to generate publicity for their guide
8318995 i am incredibly proud to have achieved this accolade particularly from such a respected guide as hardens
8318996 it is our feeling that the writers of restaurant guides such as hardens vary in their opinions from food guides such as michelin and it is the latter that our industry as a whole looks to as the ultimate gauge of success
8318997 if i never speak to that guy for the rest of my life it wouldnt bother me one bit
8318998 wouldnt give a fuck i admire gordon but would i lose sleep knowing he wouldnt be there no chance when you wake up in the morning and look in the mirror and all you see is a man who is constrained confined and trapped then youve got to change
8318999 put a gun to my head shoot me put me in a box and bury me because if you dont ill come back and come back ill never give up until i get where i want to go

8319001 opinia unanima in acest moment este ca avem nevoie de regandirea strategiei de securitate a romaniei lucrurile s au schimbat in mod dramatic iar evolutiile impun regandirea modului in care operam pe plan intern dar si in planul colaborarii noastre cu ue si nato dominoul a pornit in regiune fitilul a fost aprins si de aceea trebuie sa fim pregatiti pentru toate scenariile inclusiv cele mai fericite si cele mai putin fericite pentru ca in acest moment perioada de calm si echilibru relativ stabil din regiune s a frant

8319012 here rests in honored glory an american soldier known but to god
8319013 the overall appearance of the memorial is not what it should be and we know this is a problem
8319014 a replica is not the same thing as the original
8319015 the cracks continue to grow and i cant predict what the weather is going to continue to do to the monument
8319016 cemetery officials heard our concerns and were not very receptive to changing their plans
8319017 if they were to replace the monument with the same marble material it would eventually start cracking again
8319018 for now we will intermittently repair the monument with grouting process that should hold for several years at a time
8319019 cracks cannot be repaired indefinitely without the monument acquiring a patched worn and shabby appearance which is the antithesis of its purpose and contrary to arlington national cemeterys mission of maintaining a dignified fitting memorial to our countrys fallen soldiers
8319020 i worry that as the cracks worsen it will eventually take away from the visitors experience
8319021 i dont know why the fuck they wont let us ride the dart on the cheap these mother fckers in council dont know a goddam thing about what goes on east of lower downtown

8319025 instant click and shoot capturing all those special memories you wouldnt want to miss a convenience that digital technology like modern cameras today provide us with the various types of cameras we have nowadays one will surely have a hard time figuring out what kind of camera specifically suits his or her needs and of course an important factor to consider the price thats why many of us want to get a hold of those bargain digital cameras available in the market due to the reason that modern cams are actually quite costly if you consider yourself a gadget freak you can be considered as a wise shopper who patiently roams around in all those stores and shopping malls just to get your favorite modern device whether its the best compact digital camera or the best mini digital camera you are looking for youll surely get it in a price lower than the usual especially taking into consideration that there have been many store out there that offer them in a cheaper price there are also those online stores that provide promos and discounts with these factors you will surely have the kind of digital cam you want for yourself however there are so many things to consider when you are looking for the camera you want to get for your needs and another essential factors that you need to consider aside from the price are the camera features these definitely matters so that you know what best suits your needs to satisfy how you want you camera to operate aside from the weight size and resolution the additional features like multiple shoots panoramic settings color switching and many more are certainly important for you to know the best digital compact camera whether branded or not must possess all these features mentioned above these are considered as guarantees that you have purchased an up to date digital cam it might not be as expensive similar to those cameras you see in magazines or television you still have the same camera with parallel features camera features truly help a lot in enhancing your photos and make them better than the usual even the best digital video cameras have these to give more improvement and quality on the picture or video results all you need to do when purchasing a digital cam or a video cam is be a wise buyer at all times source out to other stores and malls and even those that you see online to be able to have the best camera you need deciding on what to get is surely confusing and surely with all those variations you see in the market more difficulty on what to get adds up but all these should not be worried anymore if you make a checklist on what specific camera or video camera you want write all those features that you want your camera to have or when you are about to buy one read the labels and the manuals first so that youll be sure youre getting the appropriate one for you all it takes is extra patience and an ounce of cleverness

8319037 we decided to stop using the word progressive to describe the more liberal of san franciscos political factions because it is a politically loaded term that doesnt mean much to our readers and while progressive may be the preferred term of some politicians it doesnt describe where they sit on the traditional political spectrum we believe using adjectives such as far left and ultra liberal more accurately describe city politicians and policies in that broader context

8319047 pollack seems oddly unaware of historys motivating forces to assert that what triggers revolutions civil wars and other internal unrest is psychological factors particularly feelings of extreme despair is plain silly the boston tea party could not have been prevented by prozac what is troubling about pollacks view which is fairly representative of his fellow liberal interventionists who are likely to be in power soon is its lack of clarity no matter what good will americas policy community proclaims toward the middle east this mix of blinkered indulgence of israel and disdain for the rest of the region as well as a predilection for wilsonian dreams over achievable goals suggests we will remain in the wilderness for some time to come
8319048 by restoring the colonel to what now seems his rightful position as a courageous principled radical who was dickinsons chosen reader admirer and advocate wineapple throws what she describes as a small considered beam upon the work and life of these two seemingly incompatible friends the recluse and the activist that beam when directed by a writer as thorough and intuitive as wineapple brightens not only the pale figures of the poet and the hitherto elusive colonel but the poems for which upon occasion dickinson drew inspiration from higginsons more active life
8319049 certain writers have a style that can be best likened to body odor irresistible to some obnoxious to many and apparently imperceptible to the writer himself therouxs lack of self awareness his failure to observe the basic hygiene of modesty is compelling in its way how can anyone be this narcissistic you wonder in disbelief in appalled fascination after reading the auto hagiography of the turkmen leader niyazov theroux summarizes it as pages and pages most of it self reverential he could be writing a press release for his own book

8319101 in four months well have an administration that actually believes in science lol but yeah
8319102 my fav from 2nite just think about this in six months we will have an administration that actually believes in science mark warner yes
8319103 warners speech was fantastic we have to fund and tech to save this nation and remain competitive
8319104 im a big fan of former gov mark warner right now think in 4 months we could have a presidency that believes in science itd be nice
8319105 best line of warners speech so far in four months we will have an administration that believes in science
8319106 we delivered broadband to the most remote areas of our state because if you can send a job to bangalore india you can sure as heck send one to danville virginia and to flint michigan and to scranton pennsylvania and to peoria illinois
8319107 in a global economy you shouldnt have to leave your hometown to find a world class job
8319108 yes but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could they didnt stop to think whether or not they should
8319109 the lack of humility before nature thats being displayed here uh staggers me
8319110 tangas para mujeres versus braguitas tangas para hombres versus calzoncillos o slips
8319111 if we are working on the basis of our mutual interests then its logical to implement this agreement
8319112 this is an old way of doing things that has nothing to do with modern realities
8319113 primarily i think the u s was looking for things to take away and penalize russia for in georgia
8319114 this is a vote of no confidence in improving u s russian relations
8319115 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8319116 all you need is 200 people in the crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times
8319117 we have not found willing partners on the other side of the table
8319118 scrupulous i mean scrupulous in following the directions the campaign gave him
8319119 cant get overly excited by a down in the situation right now because this process does go up and down
8319120 down the road we will be looking at what may be required to rebuild the georgian military
8319121 right now the mission of the united states military is to provide humanitarian assistance

8319128 fen meno privatizador de la violencia en el pa s
8319129 discursos pol ticos ni dec logos de buena voluntad como se podr frenar la violencia en m xico porque el problema no es jur dico pol tico sino econ mico social es decir las causas que ocasionan esta ola de violencia est en el modelo de desarrollo neoliberal y en la falta de solidaridad social y equidad pues predomina el lucro y el consumismo mercantilizado que es donde se ubica la llamada econom a sumergida o ilegal que generan las actividades como narcotr fico secuestro tr fico de personas y armas entre otras
8319130 our studies show that with only three out of every 10 people of military age being capable of joining the army we are going to have to do something different
8319131 its a tough structured day some of them have sat on the couch for 18 years but i havent heard any howling yet
8319132 by and large they are chomping at the bit they are ready to go
8319133 theres no jobs out there nothing its just horrible and it got hard just trying to support myself and go to school at the same time
8319134 the teachers here are helping a lot my best class is english the hardest is probably the math
8319135 we have two missions get the ged and prepare them physically and mentally for basic training
8319136 these kids may have quit at some point but the big thing is a lot of people have quit on them
8319137 we need to have a better quality budget than the one this year the government has become accustomed to running a budget deficit and has started to employ a soft budget policy leading to the possibly highest rate of inflation in the last few years in the first quarter
8319138 i am concerned by the full blown populism which from time to time touches the governments work i am convinced that we should have pragmatic policies
8319139 i can say that i will not sign a weak budget with a big budget deficit
8319140 it is obvious that the foreign exchange policy to strengthen the hryvnia has forced that tendency
8319141 i am convinced that this is not enough ukraine should have a minimum of reserves to cover six months worth of imports
8319142 i hope that these relations will get better and become more pragmatic but for this it is necessary for the two offices presidential and prime minister to do their work competently
8319143 im going to miss seeing lou piniella throw his cap
8319144 i used to love when sweet lou would toss those bases
8319145 its made a fluid entry and quickly become part of the tennis landscape there has not been one iota of drawback not from players tournament officials or fans
8319146 i think baseball will like it anything to help get the calls right
8319147 ive heard people say that tennis set the standard for the introduction of replay not just the quality but how it was done we didnt rush it we put it through its paces
8319148 we made sure the players had confidence in it we knew that if we didnt do that and then it failed it would be years before we could try it again
8319149 you can make all the right calls you want but if the players dont have confidence in it its a recipe for disaster
8319150 i think it will work great in baseball it will add to the enjoyment of the spectators
8319151 football does it basketball too why not in baseball the tradition
8319152 i was the one who helped that mad man come to power because of my selfish desires to have it my way all the time and not vote for the man who partially mirrored my views who happened to be the only real candidate opposing mccain
8319153 suppose for example youre a voter and you have candidate x and you have candidate y
8319154 candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything candidate y disagrees with you on half the issues but you believe that on the other half the candidate will be able to deliver
8319155 this is the kind of question that i predict and this has nothing to do with whats going on now but i am just saying if you look at five 10 15 years from now you may actually see this delivery issue become a serious issue in democratic debates because it is so hard to figure out how to turn good intentions into real changes in the lives of the people we represent
8319156 if the government is trying to run out the clock on the 110th congress todays decision suggests that judge bates wont let them
8319157 the glasses allow one eye to see the left image of the game and the other eye to see the right image
8319158 were using linear polarization which utilizes straight angles compared to movie theater 3d glasses which use circular polarization
8319159 for most games you add a depth of how far away your target is
8319160 a lot of people have told us that 3d has improved their aim it improves a lot of the gameplay and it makes everything seem more interesting
8319161 so um the webpage or whatever is just something you do for fun do you have a real job
8319162 well that is our job we dont technically get money for you
8319163 i would rather sit in jail 100 years than bring harm to one civilian in iraq through an illegal war that is a gross misuse of american might
8319164 we just want to be here to show people that colorado is a battleground state and just because they have the dnc here its not a free pass for the democrats
8319165 i am an atheist lesbian male to female transsexual and i embrace it all
8319166 i had a history professor who had a quote in his classroom stand up for what you believe in even if you stand alone
8319167 i tell them the same can be said for ross perot helping bill clinton win in 92
8319168 i was going to give the money to carbon offsets and that just got confusing
8319169 now what kind of question is that i dont care how many homes the man owns ask him something i care about like how many soldiers are in iraq how much money are we spending over there
8319170 that would have been perfect because then i could say shes getting the last laugh

8319178 this is denver this is the southwest and there is a significant hispanic population here and salazar resonates well with them
8319179 any strategist with any sense understands its important to do well in the intermountain west
8319180 the intermountain west is not a bastion of liberals it tends to be centrist and it tends to be independent
8319181 if youre doing a lot more than what you should for fair distribution on the aircraft well put you at the back of the line

8319187 it is time for presidential leadership on these critical issues
8319188 unfortunately with oil still nearly 50 higher than just six months ago we had to review the current structure and revise elements that will afford our ability to remain both customer friendly and cost conscious

8319192 kids out there going to average schools deserve every opportunity that kids at flash schools have
8319193 like school reporting is already a feature of our system

8319204 cancelling these subsidies might reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 6 percent a year while contributing 0 1 percent to global gdp
8319205 governments should urgently review their energy subsidies and begin phasing out the harmful ones
8319206 many fossil fuel subsidies are introduced for political reasons but are simply propping up and perpetuating inefficiencies in the global economy
8319207 some countries spend more on subsidies than on health and education combined they stand in the way of more environmentally friendly technologies

8319235 there can be no underestimating the impact of wilkinsons actions his conversion of imitation weapons allowed criminals to arm themselves with guns capable of killing and maiming people
8319236 here we have an armoury factory in the suburbs of berkshire creating deadly weapons that are clearly ending up in the hands of 17 18 19 year olds in inner city urban london

8319302 many other acts of terror even recently that are comparable
8319303 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers
8319304 mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
8319305 the fact that barack obama chose to launch his political career at the home of an unrepentant terrorist raises more questions about senator obamas judgment than any tv ad ever could

8319583 there are very few politicians who would have been capable of that not only demonstrating the willingness to confront it but also coming out ahead of it at the end of the confrontation

8319611 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
8319612 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
8319613 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
8319614 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes

8319630 clinton ordered the attack friday but the raid was delayed a day so it would not fall on the muslim sabbath the missiles struck late at night between 1 a m and 2 a m baghdad time because clinton wished to minimize possible deaths of innocent civilians
8319631 however tempting it might be to some when much trouble lies ahead to step aside adroitly and put someone else up to take the blows i do not intend to take that cowardly course but on the contrary to stand to my post and persevere in accordance with my duty as i see it
8319632 men of goodwill can disagree and still love their country and want the best for her
8319633 i consider president george w bush the greatest president this country has ever had

8319637 the repubs are trying to use hillary supporters as they do all the other factions of their party get them angry win their votes then abandon them amp their ideals when they are elected into office
8319638 the way i see it many conservatives are doing more to hurt america than any minority group has thus far all most minorities are trying to do is live the american dream
8319639 conservatives has been living the american dream so they are easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the fox news types
8319640 easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the
8319641 they live lavish with their large bank accounts amp ignore those of us who are struggling then when the bad news bite them in the butt they look to the federal government to bail them out just like the minorities
8319642 we should be holding the rush limbaugh amp sean hannity types accountable for their role in giving us the bu h crime family
8319643 for example detroit whose mayor has been indicted on felony charges hasnt elected a republican mayor since 1961 buffalo has been even more stubborn it started putting a democrat in office back in 1954 and it hasnt stopped since unfortunately those two cities may be alone at the top of the poverty rate list but theyre not alone in their love for democrats cincinnati ohio third on the poverty rate list hasnt had a republican mayor since 1984 cleveland ohio fourth on the list has been led by a democrat since 1989 st louis missouri sixth hasnt had a republican since 1949 milwaukee wisconsin eighth since 1908 philadelphia pennsylvania ninth since 1952 and newark new jersey 10th since 1907 the only two cities in the top 10 that i didnt mention miami florida and el paso texas havent had republicans in office either just democrats independents or nonpartisans over the past 50 years the eight cities listed above have had republican leadership for a combined 36 years the rest of the time a combined 364 years theyve been led by democrats five of the 10 cities with the highest poverty rates detroit buffalo st louis milwaukee philadelphia and newark have had a democratic stranglehold since at least 1961 more than 45 years two of the cities milwaukee and newark have been electing democrats since the first model t rolled off the assembly line in 1908

8319668 these kids made it a crack house they made it a party house
8319669 there were hundreds of chicken bones all over the house both the toilets were stopped up with chicken bones
8319670 they must have had a smoke fire in here or a grease fire because there was soot all over the place
8319671 what appeared to be crack bottles were laying all over the house so they were doing some kind of drugs here

8319675 many people who have known joe for many years and have considered him a friend are disappointed
8319676 many others are actually angry he has basically turned his back on the democratic party
8319677 a vote for lamont would jeopardize our chances for getting a democrat in the white house in 2008
8319678 are a bad reflection on him as a human being
8319679 well let you know if we can use your services
8319680 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8319681 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8319682 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8319683 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8319684 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8319685 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8319686 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8319687 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8319688 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8319689 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8319690 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8319691 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8319692 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8319693 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8319694 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8319695 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8319696 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8319697 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
8319698 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
8319699 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
8319700 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
8319701 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
8319702 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
8319703 feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands
8319704 then said jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do and they parted his raiment and cast lots

8319723 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8319724 he has to bring the smoke he has to bring the rain
8319725 attack thats the vps role make the case for the presidential candidate make the case against the other guy
8319726 the advantage of the role of the vice president is he doesnt have to worry about subtlety
8319727 we remember that he voted against the creation of medicare against the creation of medicaid against the clean air act against head start against the peace corps in the 60s and americorps in the 90s he even voted against the funds to send a man to the moon
8319728 if hes the most optimistic man in america id hate to see the pessimists
8319729 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is
8319730 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
8319731 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8319732 are you sure that you werent there maybe an identitcal twin or something
8319733 actually newt gingrich is working to help prevent climate change
8319734 seems everyone that believes in gravity also hate ice cream
8319735 oftentimes one brings in celebrity for a sense of making a campaign look like its young and vibrant and visionary and all the rest of it you give it a bit of that showbiz juice the problem is that the last thing that barack obama needs is showbiz juice
8319736 hes got all the charisma hes got the speaking the whole idea of this rock star candidate is now to some extent being reframed to become a liability the democratic party has to be really careful that they dont paint themselves as a hollywood presidency kind of thing
8319737 a lot of people are beginning to realize that celebrity endorsements are doing a lot more to get you to change your mind about the celebrity than they do to get you to change your mind about a candidate
8319738 most people come to candidates with pretty set ideas of what their party is and who they like and who they dont
8319739 just because one of their favourite actors endorses someone or speaks for one of them i think its more likely that the average voter is going to say oh i used to like that celebrity but they like candidate x so i dont like that celebrity anymore
8319740 if the youth vote turns out as it did with the primaries for obama i think youre going to see a president obama
8319741 if the youth vote does as it has done in the past and that is that it always promises and looks like its going to be behind john kerry or al gore then what youre going to see is president mccain
8319742 i think it cuts both ways the candidates want celebrities there because it brings media attention but they dont want them around too much because they dont want to bring negative attention as though it is just a celebrity kind of endorsement
8319743 depending on the celebrity you might be able to register three votes but you might lose three votes there are people in hollywood who are very divisive in terms of their politics
8319744 the celebrities use it as a means of getting themselves back into the limelight
8319745 its what i would call a synergistic relationship where both sides probably benefit in a celebrity spectacle culture
8319746 a really important aspect of it is our ability to really be able to quantify what the benefit is
8319747 the green meter capability coupled with what we can already compute in terms of miles that would otherwise be traveled or gas expenditures that are associated with people going to these meetings as well as productivity loss with those travel hours is significant
8319748 green meter detects through the ip internet protocol locations of all those attendees who would travel to the host and through a series of complex algorithms is able to measure and provide metrics of what the carbon emission output would be from the trip as well as the fuel costs and fuel amounts associated with that trip
8319749 we first launched green meter a little over a year ago and since then across ilincs customers were going to save almost 2 billion pounds of carbon emissions this year
8319750 we err on the side of being extremely conservative because the numbers are so good
8319751 based on the distance of those flights it can determine the size of the jet that youd be taking
8319752 its very intuitive because of what our developers have built into it
8319753 the idea for this came from the governor janet napolitano herself who cast her efficiency review steering committee which is composed of senior staff in her office to basically go out and look for strategies that would help benefit the environment reduce travel and provide another basket of benefits that are associated with this kind of technology for web conferencing
8319754 we have end to end aes advanced encryption standard encryption that is the highest government level you can get
8319755 so that means everything that is leaving my computer right now gets encrypted and then it doesnt get unencrypted until it hits your computer
8319756 i think that in these times of tight budgets and increased sensitivity to the environment that web conferencing when done correctly can really provide a strong benefit for state and local governments
8319757 okay so see that paint color behind the murderer there do you think it would look good with stainless steel appliances
8319758 i know and its not just a fridge youre buying you also have to love that brand dishwasher and oven too so they all match
8319759 we were still working over the speech text in the car over to the fleet center in 2004
8319760 the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
8319761 second as others have pointed out mccain is perilously close to turning his pow record into a punchline
8319762 like so many john mccain served our country bravely and suffered for years as a pow for that he deserves our thanks and respect and we have paid and continue to pay him that respect but having been a pow is not an excuse for a litany of bad votes in the senate and wrong positions as a candidate having been a pow is not an excuse for voting against veterans benefits or an excuse for supporting president bushs tax cuts for the wealthy or an excuse for supporting the use of torture john mccain was a brave soldier but he cannot hide behind that experience and use it as an excuse for every bad decision hes made since hes being anything but brave as a senator and as a candidate he should continue to use that bravery to try to defend those positions if he truly believes in them he should not hide behind his war experiences thats the opposite of bravery if they can figure out an artful term for it call him a damn wimp

8319798 ricky b like you i am completely shocked that i have not been contacted by a giant website or news organization and getting paid big bucks for these convention musings will wonders never cease
8319799 the question is academic because barack is going to win dont mean to be flip
8319800 dave cullen im just going to direct you to the media matters and digby pieces i referenced above not sure how to link in comments
8319801 caruso the party and campaign really did get an immense head of steam tonight they are positively going to thunder into tomorrow i cant believe on second thought yes i can the media was so fidgety about the convention until now
8319802 it is said that a great speech depends on a great ending her ending theme of harriet tubmans
8319803 many clinton supporters say speech didnt heal case in point of what i was talking about last night
8319804 will he be sufficiently enthusiastic or will he plant an insidious seed of misgivings intentional or not that we can pick apart over analyze and blow way out of proportion
8319805 i heard barack and bill like totally dont like each other
8319806 yes stacy asked barack if hes like you know going to invite him to his american idol party next week
8319807 and like barack totally changed the subject and started talking about how awesome joe biden is
8319808 you make a very good point mishima and i hadnt been thinking of things in that way
8319809 thats what i was thinking julie sounds great and dave the downside was going to giza few years later and being really dissappointed ive heard this and ive felt a bit of vicarious disappointment

8319818 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
8319819 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
8319820 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
8319821 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
8319822 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
8319823 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
8319824 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record

8319833 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
8319834 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
8319835 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
8319836 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
8319837 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
8319838 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
8319839 the crown prosecution service wishes to make it clear that this prosecution was not an attack upon the practices or ceremonies of shia muslims
8319840 the law exists to protect the young from harm or being exposed to harm in this case both boys were made to take part in the ritual flagellation and suffered injuries to their backs
8319841 we are satisfied that given the age of the children involved the coercion employed by syed mustafa zaidi who did not accept that he was wrong and the possibility of such an incident occurring again the decision to prosecute was the correct one

8319851 ok youve convinced me now go out and put pressure on me
8319852 well we can do that well maybe we can do this
8319853 we do have a lot of question marks like a lot of teams in our league
8319854 our league is one of those leagues you just dont know for sure whos going to be what until you get in the middle of it
8319855 theres going to be a lot of good teams but theres not a team returning a group where you say theyre the clear cut favorite to win the league
8319856 youve got some quality underclassmen on these teams that are coming back
8319857 luke is going to have to be really productive for us and i think he will be but he still will have that adjustment period
8319858 were optimistic about our long term projections here but well have our trials and tribulations early

8319861 thats not a mid major problem that doesnt happen to a lot of schools our size
8319862 he had a good year and hes gone and youre not prepared for that i thought if he came back here he would maybe be a top five pick

8319872 jeffery howell the defendant who represented himself throughout the case
8319873 when a linebacker rushes the passer like that its called a blitz
8319874 the problem here is that the jets were in cover 2 and as you can see the corner really doesnt flatten out the receivers route which is his most important responsibility in cover 2 and by allowing the receiver to go vertically that will stretch the safeties with the deep zone responsibility which will open up passing lanes here and here and with the weakside linebacker not getting enough depth you can see that brady simply threw the pass there
8319875 uh no duh there rufus why dont you tell us something we dont know
8319876 oh that was an awful call thats good defense terrible call
8319877 well i dont know what the referee was looking at i mean thats a good football play i mean you have to let the guys play
8319878 you have to let the players on the field determine the outcome of the game
8319879 hes going to run into a defender somewhere right there thats all it takes
8319880 as a defensive player it is your job once you get rid of that baseball you cannot make contact with the baserunner
8319881 thats all it takes contact thats the third basemans fault for not veering to the left and getting out out of thew way
8319882 im sure everybody insides okeydokey dont forget about the big bobblehead doll promotion we have coming up saturday night
8319883 whats happened at the very top of the first round is ridiculous

8319972 no me gustaria agregar mas al sin fin de fallas de vista yo cambie del
8319973 yo lo compre hace un mes y me parece genial buen telefono tiene estilo
8319974 this is the first time that the vcsel has been tested in an application and we have shown its suitability for gas sensing
8319975 the vcsel was manufactured by vertilas and the technical university of munich here at siemens we are working on a co sensor prototype while vertilas plans to commercialize the 2 3 m vcsel
8319976 a v shaped quantum well design was employed with 1 nm of pure inas in the centre of the quantum well
8319977 otherwise the device is a typical buried tunnel junction inp vcsel
8319978 the laser wavelength is modulated sinusoidally at frequencies in the kilohertz range
8319979 an absorption line converts the wavelength modulation to an amplitude modulation which is recorded by the photodetector a narrowband detection is possible which allows for very selective and sensitive detection of the absorption signal with a good noise suppression the method is also insensitive to unwanted light such as sunlight on the photodetector a lock in amplifier was used to perform standard second harmonic detection
8319980 we did a wavelength scan of 3 7 nm corresponding to a temperature variation of 15 37 c
8319981 this was not the whole tuning range at least 6 nm is likely
8319982 i do believe on thursday the outdoor auditorium will be full to capacity
8319983 it will be a historic event that we are going to see a black man accept the nomination of my party so how could i not be proud to be an american and to be a democrat
8319984 i will vote for a yellow dog before i ever vote for a republican so it doesnt matter who the nominee is at the end of the day i will support sen obama 100 percent because anything is better than four more years of failed bush policy
8319985 the best thing for the democrat party was george w bush
8319986 we couldnt have asked for a better person to unify our party
8319987 hillary clinton was my obama from a previous generation she could relate to the people of louisiana and the youth of earlier generations
8319988 but i dont want to live in an america where the president sees me as the enemy i can face dying because of a disease but not because of politics
8319989 we have some really conservative pockets in alabama that they dont really want to talk about aids
8319990 we know how to prevent hiv transmissions but we dont have enough money to prevent it especially in states like alabama
8319991 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
