5440021 i was mad but i know stuff like that happens its not like it was the mechanics fault but i thought for sure id lost the cup
5440022 i knew that if salom won i had to get fourth i was trying to think about it but not too much i didnt want to have my head full of a load of pressure going into the last race in the race i knew that he was ahead of me and i was trying to get past the guys around me but i also didnt want to crash the lap before it stopped the bike lost a bit of power but i didnt think too much of it then it just quit
5440023 i really had to push for it but i love this track and as its the last race of the season i didnt want to come away second
5440024 when matt caught me i followed him for a couple of laps and picked up a few lines i got back in front but i couldnt get away from him then i knew it would come down to the last lap i had the plan to pass him at the end of the front straight going onto the last lap and that is what i did
5440025 i knew that i was pretty good on the brakes into the last corners so i was happy to lead
5440026 he came past me up the inside into the last left hander but then ran wide i looked over and i knew that i could get him back at the right so i did

5440051 we would have been aware of any unusual activity right away it would have been triggered by any unusual volume there is an automated system called blue sheeting or the cboe market surveillance system that everyone in the business knows about it provides information on the trades the name and even the social security number on an account and these surveillance systems are set up specifically to look into insider trading the system would look at the volume and then a real person would take over and review it going back in time and looking at other unusual activity
5440052 the system is so smart that even if there is a news event that triggers a market event it can go back in time and even the parameters can be changed depending on what is being looked at

5440074 the parchment was catalogued incorrectly at some point in history at first i couldnt believe my eyes i was incredulous
5440075 this was the document that a lot of historians were looking for
5440076 simply put the pope recognized that they were not heretics but guilty of many other minor crimes such as abuses violence and sinful acts within the order
5440077 this will allow anyone to see what is actually in documents like these and deflate legends that are in vogue these days
5440078 the most incredible thing is that 700 years have passed and people are still fascinated by all of this
5440079 the precise reproduction of the parchments will allow scholars to study them touch them admire them as if they were dealing with the real thing
5440080 but even better it means the originals will not deteriorate as fast as they would if they were constantly being viewed

5440221 the putin doctrine has been very much about rolling back the ukrainian and georgian revolutions and getting back to a position of malleable semi authoritarian governments that the russians are able to control
5440222 thats the aim in georgia regime change even if they stop their tanks miles from tbilisi they want saakashvili out
5440223 these russians they just fight fight and fight and they just dont listen to reason

5440243 data transformation definition sourcing translation and mapping is a key component of any application and middleware deployment
5440244 the time and costs involved are so large that many critical projects become prohibitively expensive to overcome this problem a great deal of effort has gone into the definition of standard data representations that all applications can share xml has emerged as the basis of all such standards but even xml based standards can solve only part of the problem we still need to transform information in its current format to xml based representations
5440245 first is the diversity of formats used to encode information exchanged between applications business processes and trading partners second is the variety of components and technologies such as brokers etl tools and home grown programs written in various scripting languages that are used for data transformation across multiple systems in most large companies we refer to this as the problem of technology dis integration third and perhaps most costly is that more and more business processes require the integration of extremely complex data types

5440253 people linked to the intelligence community of the major countries have been closely involved in studying ufo cases since world war two that interest is legitimate whether it is purely personal as most of them claim or related to their official duties the same is true in parapsychology
5440254 t he phenomenon comes in an environment of manifestations that include heightened awareness of synchronicities paranormal sounds and lights and occasionally absurd coincidences similar to those described in the poltergeist literature
5440255 by denying the reality of the reports brushing aside the witnesses and treating them like fools or crooks the academic skeptics are actually teaching the public that science is impotent at studying the phenomenon

5440539 before taking the country to war this administration owed it to the american people to give them a 100 percent accurate picture of the threat we faced unfortunately our committee has concluded that the administration made significant claims that were not supported by the intelligence
5440540 in making the case for war the administration repeatedly presented intelligence as fact when in reality it was unsubstantiated contradicted or even non existent as a result the american people were led to believe that the threat from iraq was much greater than actually existed there is no question we all relied on flawed intelligence but there is a fundamental difference between relying on incorrect intelligence and deliberately painting a picture to the american people that you know is not fully accurate

5440591 before edwards admission the times never made a serious effort to investigate the story even as the national enquirer wrote one sensational report after another
5440592 i am asking you all not to blog about this topic until further notice
5440593 i believe this is a story we will be avoiding because it appears to me that theres absolutely nothing to it this seems to be just sort of a staple of modern campaigns that you get through at least one love child which turns out not to be a love child and i think we can all do better that this one

5440606 the paradox stems from the basic dilemma that underpins the economics of fashion for the industry to keep growing customers must like this years designs but they must also become dissatisfied with them so that theyll buy next years many other consumer businesses face a similar problem but fashion unlike say the technology rely on improvements in power and performance to make old products obsolete raustiala and sprigman argue persuasively that in fashion its copying that serves this function bringing about what they call induced obsolescence copying enables designs and styles to move quickly from early adopters to the masses and since no one cool wants to keep wearing something after everybody else is wearing it the copying of designs helps fuel the incessant demand for something new

5440625 we have always felt that the galaxy should aspire to be the club that sets the pace and tone in major league soccer i believe bruce sees it the same way and will put us back in that position
5440626 nearly all of world population growth is now concentrated in the worlds poorer countries
5440627 and by 2050 global population is projected to rise to 9 3 billion between now and mid century these diverging growth patterns will boost the population share living in todays less developed countries from 82 percent to 86 percent
5440628 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5440629 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5440630 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5440631 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5440632 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5440633 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5440634 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5440635 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5440636 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5440637 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5440638 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5440639 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5440640 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5440641 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5440642 with future forecasts declaring ultimate doom from all components of the man altered world it seems there is a clog in the conduit of information transmitted between those in control and the public at large

5440685 superdelegates werent counting how many of their constituents had voted for senator clinton or senator obama but rather how much money was being put into their war chests by the obama campaign and the democratic hierarchy this money moved from one candidate to another via pacs would determine their endorsements and ultimately the nomination
5440686 republican john mccain and democrat barack obama are neck and neck in colorado solidifying the state as a key swing area that will be pivotal in deciding who becomes the next president of the u s overall coloradans favored mccain 44 percent to 41 percent but the gap was within the polls margin of error of plus or minus 4 38 percentage points mccain also had a slightly higher approval rating 55 percent to 53 percent also within the margin of error
5440687 party unity is an issue for obama in the buckeye state while mccain has an 89 7 lead with voters who identify as republicans obama has a narrower 75 17 edge with democrats delving deeper into the numbers it appears that residual unhappiness from hillary clinton supporters could be the cause

5440700 although the fact that approximately 4 percent of clergy have sexually abused minors outrages and saddens the laity the overwhelming majority of the clergy have led honourable lives of dedication to the church and her people more distressing to the laity is the inadequate response by bishops and other church leaders to this problem over the last 25 years their responses were characterized by moral laxity excessive leniency insensitivity secrecy and neglect
5440701 by releasing the details and unveiling his own sworn deposition the archbishop revealed a flawed and secretive system where priests and bishops employed by the archdiocese to this day protected their own standing before television cameras tuesday the cardinal once again said he was sorry for not acting sooner and promised more transparency in the sense im responsible for this archdiocese i have to accept the blame george said
5440702 this church that is seemingly or truly old can still build her tomorrow and the tomorrow of humanity if she has sufficient faith
5440703 the church may appear to be old she may appear to be aged and made up of older people but the church knows she can count on the newness and love of god even before she desires it

5440707 we have always felt that the galaxy should aspire to be the club that sets the pace and tone in major league soccer

5440749 over the last 20 years as pornography has become vastly more accessible and available the incidence of rape and sexual abuse has gone down steadily

5440764 electronic tagging devices can be appropriate as a condition of parole or probation
5440765 the cindy bischof law goes far beyond this placing long term electronic tags on men who have never been found guilty of any crime
5440766 without the benefit of a trial yet the foundation of our entire criminal justice system is based on a defendant being presumed innocent until proven guilty
5440767 are increasingly being used in family law cases to help one side jockey for an advantage in child custody
5440768 such orders are generally done ex parte without the accuseds knowledge and with no opportunity afforded for him to defend himself
5440769 a man can accidentally be in the same park or mall as his ex wife girlfriend and the electronic monitoring device could lead to his arrest even if he never actually saw her some men have even been tricked into violating the orders by former spouses the device will make this easier a woman could call her estranged husband tell him she needs him to come to her house because of a crisis with their children and then have an electronic record of his violation
5440770 perhaps such a drastic measure would be warranted if the men forced to wear the devices had meaningful and fair trials and were found to be guilty of violent or dangerous crimes however the bischof law empowers judges with the ability to mandate the gps tracking device on anyone who is accused of violating an order of protection
5440771 unfortunately the rush to protect the abused is so incredibly aggressive that the rights of the accused have been violated
5440772 i dont see any safeguard in this law this law basically presumes in these situations men are guilty

5440786 it is from the ice core perspective thus not possible to attribute the warming of the past century solely to the influence of mankind the climate changes recorded by meteorological observations since 1875 are not unique in climate history taking into account that the period round 1875 appears to have been one of the coldest during the holocene makes it even more difficult

5440802 it is obviously disappointing not to be selected and you want to be playing for your country
5440803 but if mr capello doesnt put you in the squad then we have to go out and prove him wrong

5440805 but as soon as the squad is picked and if youre in the under 21 side you should be ready to roll your sleeves up and think i must do well in this squad it is important that players view international football whether it be for the under 21 side or the seniors as an education

5441059 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5441060 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5441061 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5441062 pakistans nuclear arsenal is in the hands of the army and the army is not changing hands so whatever the situation was before is largely what it will continue to be
5441063 if pakistan becomes a more fragile and even failing state then the nuclear assets will be everybodys problem internationally the best way to prevent that from happening is in strengthening the new governments ability to govern

5441074 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5441075 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5441076 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

5441100 one of my fondest memories was when i was about seven years old and i was going to fenway park
5441101 one of my aunts had tickets to a game there on the fourth of july
5441102 that is one of my earliest memories of baseball as a kid getting autographs and doing those types of things that was when i first started to play growing up in a family that is from new england and although i mostly grew up in northern virginia the red sox were ingrained in your mind you were just born into being a red sox fan so baseball was a part of life for my family
5441103 i remember making our little league all star team when i was 12
5441104 that also was when we won our district and we went to the state tournament i had a bunch of my best friends there with me and it was a big deal because we got to stay in a hotel the winner of that got to go to williamsport and the little league world series we didnt get there but we got close
5441105 when i was in high school my goal was always to play at the highest level of college baseball that i could
5441106 i didnt play any other sports i knew my abilities were very marginal but i wanted to play at that level i went to a division ii school out of high school than transferred to a division i school and that was one of the greatest experiences of my life i met some very close friends there including the current head coach at radford
5441107 i knew very early that i wanted to coach i really did
5441108 my friends still kid me about this but there was a newspaper that was put out called the ncaa news
5441109 i was very fortunate because my college coach at the time ran a camp in the summer that was widely known as one of the best camps on the east coast and really the entire country its called the best in virginia camp and that is where i got into coaching it had all of these college coaches from up and down the east coast including sec and acc schools coming to this camp at fort union military academy to work i was one of the only college kids there helping out with the camp thats how it started for me
5441110 i met my wife shaun when i was working at the university of notre dame
5441111 i first saw her at a supermarket deli and at that time she was actually working for adidas at notre dame she was outside eating with a co worker in south bend i saw here there and asked her out about a day or two later our first official date was coveleski stadium the class a field in the midwest league for the arizona diamondbacks and i went there because a former player of mine at stetson brian snyder was in town playing and it was a total coincidence he called me up and said hey im playing in south bend why dont you come and see me so i asked her if she liked baseball and she fortunately said yes
5441112 in 3 days 60 hours i sit in front of computer for 58 hours besides eating and going to restroom i feel so good and i earn 200 rmb

5441119 as we approach this historic finish line i am pleased that decades of hard work unprecedented public and private partnerships and countless hours of consumer education are working
5441120 ceas market research shows widespread consumer understanding of the transition and those americans who need to take action are doing so
5441121 we continue to recognize and understand the need to ensure a smooth dtv transition together with our industry and government partners we are committed to ensuring that television viewers do not lose service because they were not aware of the transition or their options
5441122 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5441123 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5441124 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5441125 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5441126 says we should take our state backward other folks want to keep things the same as they are now
5441127 congressman hulshof says he wants to take the state in a new direction but the facts and his record speak otherwise
5441128 congressman hulshof has been part of the problem in washington and now hes back in missouri embracing the same failed policies that have crippled our states economy thats not a new direction thats the same failed course
5441129 in february congressman hulshof had an important vote that allowed him to make a clear choice give billions to the big oil companies or invest that money in alternative fuels like wind solar and cellulosic ethanol
5441130 not surprisingly the congressman sided with the big oil companies like congressman hulshof jay nixon supports additional drilling and exploration for oil but unlike congressman hulshof jay nixon knows we dont need to give billions away to big oil companies when theyre making record profits and missourians are paying record prices at the pump

5441159 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5441160 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5441161 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5441162 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5441163 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5441164 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5441165 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5441166 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5441167 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5441168 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5441169 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5441170 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5441171 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5441172 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5441173 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5441174 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5441175 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5441176 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5441177 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5441178 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5441179 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5441180 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5441181 weve told our students all summer about engagement about being a community about vitality
5441182 this tells the students at the beginning of the semester that yes we mean what we say i just think you have to re roll out that red carpet again for opening
5441183 were trying to get students more involved with the community in terms of volunteer opportunities and the services that are available
5441184 when youre a student here youre not only a member of the campus but also of the city of oswego community as well
5441185 there are a lot of opportunities for students to be engaged be involved and be social
5441186 i want a student to realize there are so many positive choices they can make on campus
5441187 showing how to make the most of students four years of college
5441188 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5441189 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5441190 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5441191 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5441192 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5441193 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5441194 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5441195 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5441196 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5441197 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5441198 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5441199 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5441200 we are seeing evidence of ss 21 missiles in south ossetia
5441201 but let me be clear if it rolled in after august 6th it needs to roll out
5441202 that would be in keeping with the russian commitment on withdrawal
5441203 anything such as that or any other military equipment that was moved in would be in violation of the ceasefire and should be removed immediately
5441204 the only forces that are permitted to remain under the ceasefire agreement are the forces that were in there at the august 6th timeframe
5441205 were seeing them solidify their positions in south ossetia and abkhazia
5441206 i cant say whether they are actually moving people out right now or not but we do expect them to start moving out we expect them to move out slowly so this may take some time

5441243 we have to move away from this total ban and find ways for people to let off steam a little bit more but safely
5441244 weve got to allow political videos but with some safeguards
5441245 we will do whatever is necessary and no one should have any illusion

5441255 man f hlt den schmerz aber wir machen einfach weiter
5441256 eines tages war ich im keller und habe tanz und gymnastik bungen gemacht als mir gott eine vision gab
5441257 when i hit the street the rain had already turned l a into a mud river it was a short swim down eldorado to my convertible

5441259 es soll 100 000 kostenlose kondome im olympischen dorf geben bei mir sind keine angekommen
5441260 da laufen frauen rum die sich ganz sch n pr sentieren
5441261 es kann doch jeder selbst f r seine kondome sorgen
5441262 vor athen haben wir drei bei der einkleidung bekommen diesmal kein einziges
5441263 das ist doch eine super sache wenn man nicht dran gedacht hat
5441264 ich selbst hab aber noch keine gefunden vielleicht muss ich noch weiter suchen
5441265 da laufen frauen rum die sich ganz sch n pr sentieren
5441266 f r den fall der f lle habe ich daher meine eigenen kondome eingepackt
5441267 ber hmte sportler k nnen eine wichtige rolle dabei spielen die botschaft zur notwendigkeit der hiv vorsorge zu vermitteln weil sie von jungen leuten als vorbild angesehen werden
5441268 ich finde das richtig gut mit den kondomen im olympischen dorf
5441269 ich selbst hab aber noch keine gefunden vielleicht muss ich noch weiter suchen
5441270 marijuana is the most violence causing drug in the history of mankind
5441271 uma pena pela fabiana sabia que ela poderia saltar entre 4 80 m e 4 85 m pois acompanhei seus treinamentos e vi o que ela poderia fazer eu queria que ela conquistasse uma medalha
5441272 n o fiquei sabendo dos problemas dela mas se ela tivesse me pedido ajuda eu teria feito o que pudesse para ajud la ela uma boa amiga
5441273 conversei com ela e tenho certeza que ela vai se manter entre as melhores do mundo sei que ela vai come ar a se preparar para as olimp adas de 2012 e vai continuar saltando muito alto
5441274 its not really about mark its about the fact that we have this feeling in our stomach in our gut in our heart that we need to work extremely hard in order to extend that agenda extend that vision and deliver the goods
5441275 this is not about ego self aggrandizement this is not about power or exercising control
5441276 i think of mark and know that he will be the conscience and moral compass of the board of supervisors and we need that
5441277 people are asking mark why the hell are you endorsing a green
5441278 i dont even want to know what kind of phone calls youve gotten from people who are really severely angry
5441279 shes the best campaign manager i think in the city
5441280 fica um sentimento de tristeza da derrota fica dif cil de explicar em cima de derrotas mas tenho certeza que a equipe evoluiu o time est mais firme fica mais com a bola
5441281 quero esta medalha de ouro para entrar na hist ria da sele o serve tamb m para abrir portas na equipe principal
5441282 darei meu m ximo na minha segunda corrida em casa
5441283 a fernanda foi genial ela comprou a responsabilidade de navegar o barco de olhar em volta de ler as condi es e foi perfeita nisso
5441284 essa regata da medalha sempre mais pegada e elas mostraram muita consci ncia montaram a b ia em segundo e no segundo contra vento foram para cima e o barco respondeu as israelenses at tentaram no ltimo popa andar mais r pido mais or ado mas em um ngulo diferente mas a fernanda n o comprou
5441285 as duas tinham algo como um bot o de liga e desliga tinham momentos geniais e outros muito ruins isso aconteceu aqui mas elas conseguiram se recuperar e foram consistentes
5441286 viemos com chances de medalha e acho que foi um resultado justo terminar com este bronze claro que elas n o foram perfeitas no meio da competi o perderam alguns pontos que as l deres n o perderam mas complicado falar que poderiam ter tido uma competi o melhor
5441287 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5441288 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5441289 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5441290 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5441291 seldom does a storytelling talent come along as potent and fully mature as mike brotherton his complex characters take you on a voyage that is both fiercely credible and astonishingly imaginative this is science fiction
5441292 star dragon is terrific fare offering readers a fusion of hard science and grand adventure
5441293 star dragon is steeped in cosmology the physics of interstellar travel exobiology artificial intelligence bioscience brotherton author of many scientific articles in refereed journals has written a dramatic provocative utterly convincing hard science sf novel that includes an ironic twist that fans will love
5441294 readers hungry for the thought provoking extrapolation and rigorous technical detail of old fashioned hard sf are sure to enjoy astronomer brothertons first novel
5441295 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5441296 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5441297 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5441298 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5441299 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5441300 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5441301 the theatre can never cause a social change it can articulate pressure towards one help people celebrate their strengths and maybe build their self confidence above all it can be the way people find their voice their solidarity and their collective determination
5441302 its a thunderclap both for pakistan and its foreign supporters
5441303 the one thing the two had in common was their opposition to musharraf
5441304 a lot of pakistanis feel he is not fit to be president or prime minister of pakistan until these allegations are finally cleared up
5441305 now that hes gone they will be accountable to whats happening
5441306 theres going to be a lot of change now in pakistans policies both internally and towards afghanistan
5441307 a fight against pashtun tribesmen along the north west frontier of pakistan who are supportive of their pashtun first cousins in afghanistan
5441308 it think with all of its other troubles islamist militants in the tribal areas secessionists in baluchistan the last thing the government would want to do is stir the pot in kashmir
5441309 moments later a second car bomber came and wanted to detonate his bombs police identified him and opened fire on him
5441310 showed their hostility to the freedom of the afghan people
5441311 these reports indicate that the enemies of the people of afghanistan intend to attack civilian military and government targets during afghan independence celebrations
5441312 with so many gen yers still living at home with mum and dad its not surprising they are less affected by an economic downturn in comparison to home owners and young families
5441313 and the cooking skills they have been taught at home have well and truly come to waste with 29 per cent spending more on takeaways
5441314 it takes many months and many many meals to produce the only national guide in the country
5441315 when someone hears this from an internist or cardiologist who says its really bad for you it increases your risk of lung cancer its bad for your heart people tend to blow that off if theyre feeling well
5441316 but if they have a medical problem and are not going for just a routine checkup they may tend to listen to that advice more plastic surgery its a little bit different people are desirous of an elective procedure and thats their main objective in coming in its something they truly want
5441317 hey weve got no pitching lets say we trade edinson volquez for josh hamilton
5441318 i was a big dork i grew up with braces and glasses and i wasnt too active or someone who got into the social crowd so i understand not fitting in
5441319 but i think everyone has their own version of feeling out of place one of the great things we have the ability to do here is show you can have that awkward stage and it is not about whether you are the popular girl or the nerdy one it is about feeling comfortable with who you are and accepting that
5441320 growing up in hollywood there is so much pressure from everywhere to look a certain way and dress a certain way
5441321 i know that i dont fit that convention so i am happy to be a part of something that will allow young girls to feel confident about themselves and think okay that girl is not entirely the ideal of what the perfect picture is supposed to be
5441322 i kind of grew up on movie sets so to do it on my own has been really amazing
5441323 it is a different experience when i was younger i would sit in the trailer and i would hang out
5441324 there are no winners in this saga theres no one running around the bulldogs club yelling and screaming with delight this is actually a relatively sad day
5441325 from 1973 to 1990 the united states sold saddam hussein more than a quarter of his weapons
5441326 americans who have not paid their hospitals fees or insurance premiums are not entitled to emergency medical care
5441327 we hope to have a model in place this season our opening up of the rights will certainly be done
5441328 they also are uncertain whether the games will be hosted on the local team site the rsn site or both details of advertising within the feeds and who sells that are also still to be worked out adding to the uncertainty is the fact that some teams do not even hold the necessary streaming rights since some have sold them to regional sports networks along with their tv rights
5441329 perhaps by finding ways for the m l b to work more closely with the broadcasters and their advertisers
5441330 pero hace a os que trabajo aqu fui siempre fiel a usted pr cticamente entregu mi vida al trabajo

5441332 unwavering support for the failed unfunded federal mandate no child left behind
5441333 trying to convince voters that the country is on the right track and simply needs more of the same policies and ideas
5441334 we had the commitments there but we didnt have the money in hand
5441335 with the rising fuel costs and the economy being what it is those were a couple of the contributing factors
5441336 we are incredibly happy healthy and very much together here in los angeles recording our new record
5441337 besides this ridiculously overblown lawsuit we are having one of the most inspiring wonderful and exciting times that weve experienced to date
5441338 so as you may have heard we are being sued by our former record company for the ridiculously oversized totally unrealistic and pretty silly but slightly clever sum of 30 000 000 insane yea thats what we said too
5441339 we had been signed to our record contract for 9 years
5441340 basically under california law where we live and signed our deal one cannot be bound to a contract for more than 7 years this is widely known by all the record companies and has been for years in fact so aware of it are they that they desperately try to make deals outside of california whenever possible it is a law that protects people from lengthy unfair career spanning contracts
5441341 not for failing to deliver music or for quitting but simply because roughly 45 days ago we exercised our legal right to terminate our old out of date contract which according to the law is null and void
5441342 shouldnt a record company be able to turn a profit from selling that many records or at the very least break even we think so
5441343 ich habe selbst einige gespr chs termine vorgeschlagen beim besuch des stammzell programms waren f r alle eineinhalb stunden vorgesehen es wurden drei stunden
5441344 i was interested in someone who never gets their story told as opposed to someone who always has the limelight
5441345 my god daughter just turned 16 and lives on the coast

5441349 not a whole lot of us are like this affected me personally
5441350 a lot of the ex members are older the forums inherently attract younger members
5441351 kind of like the battle in seattle its all self initiative it just started with a few cities like a google group
5441352 we let the cops know always adhere to the law we follow that rule
5441353 we all have our own individual activist causes but anonymous is for
5441354 i have worked in soup kitchens i have personally given money to and helped in the trenches in locations with tsunami victims katrina victims my family and neighbors and people in hospitals who were severely injured and many other situations with scientology
5441355 as a matter of fact i have helped homeless people i have worked in soup kitches i have worked in the trenches at ground zero and katrina i have run food and clothes drives every year i have helped with park clean ups
5441356 society thirsting for more control of more people substitutes religion for the spirit the body for the soul an identity for the individual and science and data for truth in this direction lies insanity increasing slavery less knowingness greater scarcity and less society
5441357 scientology has opened the gates to a better world it is not a psycho therapy nor a religion it is a body of knowledge which when properly used gives freedom and truth to the individual
5441358 if a man really wanted to make a million dollars the best way to do it would be start his own religion
5441359 tudo que puder ser feito para trazer tranq ilidade para a cidade v lido eu quero que elas for as federais continuem depois das elei es cuidando do direito de ir e vir das pessoas
5441360 em situa es extremas faz algum sentido garantir a presen a de tropas para assegurar a tranq ilidade no dia do pleito mas com esta anteced ncia pedir a presen a de tropas federais me parece um reconhecimento do fracasso da pol tica de seguran a do estado
5441361 se voc perguntar popula o bvio que ela vai querer mais seguran a mas precisa fazer a pergunta certa voc quer seguran a com data de validade para proteger candidatos a maioria vai dizer que n o que cinismo
5441362 estou pedindo ao tre que convoque os partidos para debater sobre essa presen a ser que v o combater tamb m o abuso do poder econ mico o uso da m quina p blica que s o crimes eleitorais t o graves quanto o constrangimento causado por mil cias e traficantes
5441363 as institui es devem garantir elei es livres e limpas
5441364 temos que ter cautela pois 99 9 da popula o das favelas de trabalhadores gente de bem voc n o pode estabelecer uma confronta o que possa gerar a morte de inocentes civis a pol tica do confronto sem intelig ncia o que tem marcado o rio de janeiro e com um balan o extremamente melanc lico
5441365 importante que a cidade tenha seguran a com ex rcito e for a nacional contribuindo
5441366 mas esse processo n o deveria ser voltado apenas para os candidatos ou para as elei es preciso um processo de seguran a na cidade que seja permanente e envolva a popula o no seu conjunto
5441367 i am invisible understand simply because people refuse to see me
5441368 a cry for all the children of the world that are victims of jailing war neglect disease and abuse
5441369 inciting social discord in relation to militsiya and fsb officers
5441370 we are convinced that our close associate has not done anything illegal or objectionable and will strive for his full acquittal as well as punishment for those who initiated his persecution
5441371 its the comic strip the perfect creative outlet for me
5441372 to have these people here to witness this is such a great way to say thank you to them for the hard work they have put in
5441373 i think it was relief more than anything that all the hard work had paid off and this was really happening to me
5441374 when i knew it was going to come down to the run i knew that i had to get away first and run knowing that i had to give it everything
5441375 i could not hold back and i wanted to put everything on the line because this is the olympic games
5441376 i think she was only eight when i first saw that glint in her eyes
5441377 she was standing on the blocks of the pool at trinity primary school and that is when i saw that look she realised she liked winning she liked being a high achiever
5441378 we are just so happy for emma because to achieve what she has achieved means enormous sacrifice and not too many people understand the quantity of sacrifice or the amount of pain you go through to get that good
5441379 i looked on today with a lot of pride it gets back to her determination
5441380 my wife maureen and i dont get involved in any of the media we stay away from that
5441381 we just try to make sure that any time we see a problem on the horizon for emma we try to sweep those problems away and keep her in a happy frame of mind
5441382 to carry that pressure and expectation and to deliver that quality of performance is a rare thing at this level
5441383 for everybody that sols brought in not just americans but also some europeans and others they come in done the job thats had to be done and left so im just the next one in line
5441384 we placated government for 10 years and it didnt get us any place
5441385 its always controversial to be right when the governments wrong
5441386 its a shame that this particular approach that he has taken seems to be very short sighted
5441387 what on earth has this regulatory onslaught achieved it seems to have achieved precisely nothing
5441388 the moment we think this problem in washington is not going to get solved we have to pull the plug because all were doing is wasting money
5441389 something like the next half hour is brought to you by
5441390 were taking this challenge very seriously when we have our board meetings the central topic is the revenue trajectory not how happy our users are
5441391 were funded by venture capital theyre not going to chase a company whose business model has been broken so if it doesnt feel like its headed towards a solution were done
5441392 he was frosty at first he felt betrayed when she dumped him for his friend lance but after a while he caved in and has been sweet to her its not fair to owen because he really cares for her and ends up getting hurt
5441393 la oportunidad viene siempre se presenta s lo te tiene que encontrar preparado
5441394 leveraging the popularity of social networking sites barackbook allows voters to explore obamas connections with these individuals as well as their connections to one another using video and news articles
5441395 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5441396 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5441397 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5441398 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5441399 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5441400 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5441401 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5441402 die kernkraftwerke gehen erst dann wieder ans netz wenn die voraussetzungen gegeben sind dies ist in absehbarer zeit noch nicht der fall
5441403 ich hoffe dass hier von wem auch immer keine verz gerungstaktik im spiel ist
5441404 we thought the downside was limited the possibilities were reasonable and the amount of fun was limitless
5441405 if there wasnt a curve in it you could see both city limits signs
5441406 the proverbial light bulb went off i thought that might be fun to play with that name a little bit
5441407 i thought lets step out on a limb here and name the bank tightwad
5441408 to be really frank the customer base in reading kansas was not too excited
5441409 but the tightwad bank was too good to pass up
5441410 mobile has been waiting for this for a long time
5441411 we knew mobile would be a great cruise city fantasy is a perfect for mobile
5441412 die tendenz ist bezogen auf das fleisch der schafe ist positiv ich hoffe dass die ausstehenden ergebnisse diese tendenz best tigen
5441413 its not a particularly happy day for the bulldogs as its the end of sonny bills association with the club
5441414 but were pleased with the outcome and as far as were concerned the book is now closed on this chapter in the clubs history and we can move on
5441415 it has been made clear that there is no guarantee of him being re registered down the track
5441416 we lay people know how to take care of the nuts and bolts of this operation but when it comes to god thats better left to the professionals
5441417 daniel sorensen was one of the highlights of the scrimmage on saturday not only in special teams but the way he is playing defense
5441418 and when we look at the mold of who we are looking at for that spot we have played our best defense with guys like bryan kehl and david nixon on the edges
5441419 so i think sorensens future will be there and we will try to feed him the defense as fast as we can
5441420 but hes not afraid hes anxious to contribute and he has already shown that he will be a special teams player for us and this gives us a chance to train him for now and the future
5441421 eventually we might get it caught up where either mike alisa or daniel sorensen could be ready
5441422 were used to winning it all and we take it for granted a little bit its definitely a wake up call for america
5441423 i kind of got stuck out there and there was nothing i could do after that an 11 20 is so mediocre it is ridiculous
5441424 to my mom my friends in america i didnt let them down i did my best
5441425 dad tell me when to go tell me when to go
5441426 dont go yet dont go yet slow down okay go

5441442 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5441443 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open
5441444 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5441445 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5441446 we historically dont make our decisions within a 24 hour period it takes time to get everybody in a group and talk about it
5441447 let me just say that first and foremost that that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys there at jgr
5441448 i want to apologize to nascar to our partners to toyota guys a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5441449 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5441450 for us we kind of feel like in the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and chief engine builder mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5441451 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome
5441452 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5441453 well figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible
5441454 theres going to be punishment for that thats just part of life you cant do that
5441455 if this alleged incident proves true it goes against everything we stand for as an organization
5441456 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
5441457 i found out about it halfway through the day session last night when i went over there to see what was going on
5441458 i was surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing
5441459 but im sure joe and j d will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think were just going to keep working on our stuff
5441460 its not something that you like to hear about and you have to just question every chassis dyno thats ever been run on every toyota
5441461 you look at the no 32 car of brian vickers and red bull racing the 32 and the 18 and the 20 made about the same power the first run on the dyno when they took the magnet or whatever this device was out of the 18 and the 20 they both came up
5441462 what i dont know is if its a toyota problem if its a joe gibbs thing how widespread is it and how long has it been going on because a lot of whats been done by nascar has been based on the chassis dyno results
5441463 its disappointing to hear that anybody whether its a manufacturer or a team or an individual on a team would go to any length to do that

5441476 it is a little bit puzzling that the shares are fractionally down but our recommendation is to buy the reported figures are very positive operating income was 18 0 better than our expectations and net income was 10 0 better than our forecast
5441477 our vision is big but it makes sense this is a real solution with serious players and proven technology
5441478 we didnt know when it would work and were quite surprised at how well it will work
5441479 we could become the absolute world leader at about number eight and that would be a wonderful place to be at this is a real solution with serious players and proven technology
5441480 at this point theres nothing standing in our way of continuing to do what we said were going to do
5441481 the program has all of those same things built in
5441482 its an opportunity to change the way we consume energy without significantly changing our lifestyle
5441483 itll have a similar set of visual cues and some of the features that were on the concept car all those things result in lots of other mechanical parts and bits and pieces that have nothing to do with electrical energy so weve had some issues there
5441484 we have a lot of experience with lithium were pretty confident with which chemistries work and which dont work
5441485 if everyone who wanted a volt could get one that would be the dream
5441486 the u s department of energy in a report published in may found the total extra cost of providing 20 of u s electricity from wind power in 2030 versus a no new wind scenario to be 43 billion which works out to 50 cents per month for the average utility ratepayer this is because winds capital costs and added transmission costs are largely offset by fuel cost savings
5441487 vestas is the first flag planted in the state for manufacturing in the wind energy sector we hope theyll prove to be something of a bell cow
5441488 i think there are some very strong growth signals in these results stronger than i can ever remember seeing in vestas in particular i want to highlight the order book of e7 2 billion i might have bid e5 5 billion if i had been optimistic
5441489 this expansion reinforces colorados standing as a national and international leader in clean modern energy for the future
5441490 for the past several months we have been working closely with and konami to ensure that playstation 3 guitars and drum sets will all feature a basic level of gameplay compatibility
5441491 for the most part this means that the titles with musical peripherals will work with the others software a few specific examples include rock revolution software and yes you guessed it rock band 2 s guitar and drum set will work with guitar hero world tour and with rock revolution
5441492 were still working hard to ensure compatibility between the guitar hero and rock band titles currently on the market and we hope to have an announcement on that shortly
5441493 i think its a good use of resources it doesnt put any officers in danger which is a good thing
5441494 you can sit at a computer and find exactly where a suspect goes
5441495 law enforcement has a legitimate right to try to solve crimes and track suspects provided that there are protections so that the innocent are not improperly snooped upon
5441496 our main point with this is that before installing a gps tracking device secretly on someones vehicle a judicial officer should make the decision about how much evidence is good enough how long the tracking can be for and the parameters of the tracking
5441497 i want to point out its very easy to get a warrant if the police have a good reason it doesnt take a long time and if there is a real reason the warrant will be granted
5441498 its a lot more like a police officer tagging along inside your car an invisible police officer inside your car
5441499 the question always comes down to how much are we willing to give up in freedom and privacy for how much marginal increase in our security
5441500 these are increases after a long period of stability in the auto market
5441501 were seeing an uptick now but we dont consider this to be more than up upward pressure from low prices in the past
5441502 any time you have all of that activity and then the everyday workings of 61 police officers its a busy challenging opportunity
5441503 been advocating for clear specific definitions to avoid misleading green claims
5441504 the ftcs definition of carbon offsets could most affect the retailers ultra ambitious goal to someday run on 100 percent renewable energy a huge amount of which would likely have to come from offsets or renewable energy certificates
5441505 is wal mart being hypocritical or are its green efforts in good faith
5441506 i can only say the wild went to speak to him and were very respectful and shared information with him about himself and the organization and their vision
5441507 i think it was a very intelligent move on their behalf to involve him but we dont have any set plans to talk
5441508 we conveyed what we wanted to convey and made points where we wanted to we didnt talk contract at all we didnt
5441509 i can tell you that no decision about free agency has been made and that hes not even thinking about it hes focused on coming in and having a great season if you start talking about next year i think youre getting ahead of yourself
5441510 consumer spending is going to slow and it will be slower to rebound for reasons outlined above that will also make the recovery in the stock market a little slower but i expect to become bullish on the market sometime this summer if not before im looking forward to it
5441511 sadly the decoupling thesis has little support in theory or in practice
5441512 the decoupling optimists are ever hopeful that chinas rapid growth together with the rest of asias emerging market economies will offset any u

5441545 the reason you do it is to raise awareness about the inadequacy of the food stamp benefit
5441546 i just wanted to get a real world sense of what it means to survive on the average food stamp allocation just to get a sense of what people go through
5441547 that would suggest that while its true that the program was designed to be a supplement people dont have enough resources

5441617 the major factors moving oil are the dollar soon to be hurricane fay and the outlook for the u s and world economies
5441618 road travel is in decline mass transit ridership is at all time highs gasoline sales are down and auto sales are at a multi year low
5441619 the weak economic outlook from the u s britain the eu japan korea and even slower growth in china are cutting into demand and putting downward pressure on oil
5441620 there will likely be a little recovery in u s demand from lower prices but not enough to put much pressure on prices
5441621 economic news should be the dominant factor for the coming months
5441622 although fay is expected to avoid most of the offshore production areas in the gulf some computer models predict that it may enter eastern gulf production areas before making landfall on the coast of alabama or mississippi on tuesday or wednesday
5441623 which will not pose a major threat to oil and natural gas operations in the gulf
5441624 outages and storm evacuations will likely reduce demand adding a bearish influence to the market
5441625 therefore crude oil platforms in the gulf may shut down
5441626 unless fay turns we should not see any supply disruptions that will amount to anything

5441635 thats the way it goes in cricket you cant really stop and think about the guys you will be missing in the series rather than that you will have to fill in that space because that is the only way your team can win
5441636 i misread the wicket in the morning there was something for the bowlers but i thought it will be just for half an hour or so but it went on to assist them for longer
5441637 moreover we were not chasing well for sometime in last few matches but all credit to the lankans they bowled really well
5441638 both munaf and zaheer bowled well but i guess it was not enough
5441639 the next match is a day after so we will involve ourselves in some team activity take a day off and comeback strong in the next match
5441640 playing to our strength and the urge to keep working hard against a quality opposition was the key

5441645 out of the blue in front of ellie and hayley i felt a massive surge of anxiety overwhelm me like a huge wave it sucked the breath clean out of my lungs the next 48 hours were hell

5441647 it was as though someone flicked a switch i knew it was over the tears welled up as i started to walk back to the pavilion
5441648 i knew i no longer had any say in the matter the illness had come back the thought of what i was doing hit me like a kick in the guts i would probably never again experience the great highs hard work and joy of playing for england
5441649 after the president resigned i also felt morally bound to resign

5441681 we had the game won in the ninth inning lost it and fought back we gave up for runs in the second tiebreaker and then scored five it showed a lot of heart the way we battled and never quit
5441682 so far in the olympics weve competed and thats what we came here for
5441683 what we want to do is win respect play hard and show people in china that were making big big progress and we have
5441684 we have to prepare a whole lot more than team usa were playing with less talented players but it doesnt mean we cant compete that was the big thing for the six weeks we played in arizona then two weeks in new england just preparing our guys to be here in front of crowds and be able to make the routine plays
5441685 i think everybody was worried that when you have a host team like china that youre going to have some lopsided games said heid coordinator of international special projects for the mariners
5441686 but this baseball event has had no weak link in it
5441687 they do just enough of the right things and they play as a team
5441688 they know their limitations jim has done a great job with the hitting and has got them to a point where people have to make good pitches to get them out and they have some speed that causes some problems
5441689 i think most of my constituents want to see these things on their television
5441690 a lot of them dont use the internet they want to see our meetings on tv where the other cities are
5441691 im not sure how many people watch the meetings on television
5441692 i know i never do i get my news from the newspaper and the pamphlets that are sent out
5441693 i think we need to discuss whats the best bang for our buck as far as communicating with constituents before we just say this is what were going to do
5441694 we need to focus on whats happening in puyallup and not whats on tv
5441695 id like to see all of us focus on our issues and not what camera were looking at
5441696 i look at it as just part of the cost of doing the citizens business
5441697 for a city as big as puyallup its not a cost issue
5441698 were taking the edge into pharmaceutical companies and some banking companies as well
5441699 for primary applications people have thought you need fibre channel drives which nexsan doesnt offer
5441700 but the reliability of the product has made some reconsider their storage requirements
5441701 its a balance between cheap and deep and offering more functionality
5441702 its not quite like getting a ferrari for a ford taurus price more like getting a taurus for the price of a ford focus but with bmw level testing
5441703 a software suite we developed around an advanced set of heuristics used to prescreen disk drives
5441704 eventually they need to broaden the product to support more applications like unix operating systems
5441705 but for now its about how well the product is supported and nexsan can follow through with support and reliability

5441717 the cloud today is not really ready to host enterprise applications
5441718 this is more of a hybrid approach with some local hardware as well as cloud services and the distribution of the data means that if one data center location is down users can still access their information
5441719 saas is difficult for small companies because you need a really big pipe to another location
5441720 but there are still a limited number of customers who are going to use saas mostly because of bandwidth limitations

5441725 i have never been more excited to present an award in my life
5441726 its the largest stage latinos have in hollywood to be able to recognise the positive portrayals of latinos in television and music and film so youll see a lot of talent here tonight
5441727 thats the most important part the message which is not to separate the family
5441728 thats what unites society it doesnt matter if you are an immigrant thats not the point of the movie whats important is the human part that it shows
5441729 i gotta get money for my family so my life i have to risk it
5441730 the death of both of my uncles inspired me to start right
5441731 the younger kids are focusing more on their planning and problem solving while they are actually playing the game while adolescents are focusing less on their planning and strategizing and more on the here and now
5441732 the single best predictor of their skills is how much they had played video games in the past and how much they played now those were better predictors of surgical skills than years of training and number of surgeries performed
5441733 so the first question you might ask your surgeon is how many of these surgeries have you done and the second question is are you a gamer
5441734 creating an environment in which informal scientific reasoning practices are being learned
5441735 we are reaching out to the hollywood community to do what we can to ensure their safety and security
5441736 we are very discreet when it comes to our buyers
5441737 i can say there are some high profile people looking at the building
5441738 paparazzi dont go into buildings to get shots they wait until people go out and about i have yet to see a paparazzi shot that came from the inside of a private residence
5441739 then they will follow their cars and it will be like any other day in the field
5441740 they always try to get in but they have not been successful
5441741 unfortunately for me that guy was a freak a terminator
5441742 i do want to play in the nfl hopefully one day and i know i need numbers
5441743 im really behind rey and cush and i have to play catch up
5441744 delforlig kan v re gode nok men vi vil selvf lgelig gerne v re med i det hele for vi vil gerne tage ansvar for en holdbar konomisk politik

5441747 theyve been getting kickbacks for four years every quarter they get a healthy check general electric got a check every quarter for about a half million dollars and that continues today continues today and it ought to be stopped today and these companys ought to pay us back or duke ought to pay us back
5441748 these are the dirtiest deals of all time if they were so legal why did they have to keep them secret for 3 years they kept them under wraps they redacted the documents they said theyre all ok
5441749 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5441750 look mate we dont want any problems just go away because youre being racist
5441751 member states shall adopt and implement legislative and other measures to eliminate all practices which negatively affect the fundamental rights of women men girls and boys such as their right to life health dignity education or physical integrity
5441752 they member states should eliminate gender discrimination and stereotypes in the curriculum career choices and professions while putting in place gender sensitivity training programmes for educators and stakeholders
5441753 these prevention efforts will be based on an understanding of the underlying gender power relations that fuel the pandemic the challenges encountered by women in insisting on safe sex and the need for behaviour change
5441754 for just one word we would have to change our entire constitution
5441755 also the amount to change our constitution will cause financial constraints on our country
5441756 as the most far reaching of any sub regional instrument for achieving gender equality
5441757 it has been a very long journey for us the protocol has been watered down and we are not entirely happy by that but there are 23 concrete targets set down that each country must work towards it is one of the most concrete and explicit document on gender equality in the region and it will be a challenging target to all governments
5441758 members of our armed forces traveling on official orders should not have to bear any cost whatsoever associated with that official travel
5441759 our men and women in uniform deserve our utmost respect and gratitude not additional unnecessary paperwork
5441760 the current arrangement of filing reimbursement paperwork to recoup costs associated with excess baggage is an undue burden on our servicemen and women who are bravely entering or leaving a combat zone
5441761 while we have not seen an official letter from senator clinton we have responded to the vfw commander advising him that the majority of ata members have re evaluated their baggage policies for military personnel on active duty orders
5441762 collaboration operates through a process in which the successful intellectual achievements of one person arouse the intellectual passions and enthusiasms of others
5441763 the window cant close soon enough as far as i am concerned because if he carries on playing like that it wont be long before a lot of clubs are after him
5441764 hes a top top player and we could struggle to hold on to him
5441765 i usr lib64 perl5 5 10 0 x86 64 linux thread multi core
5441766 join citizen action and hcan and urge congress not to gamble with our health care future and stand up on the side of universal affordable health care for all
5441767 im quite aware of the discrepancies people have to pay for their health plans
5441768 please do not depend on your current insurance insurance is not mandatory under any law
5441769 i would support any proposal that the next governor will put in place for universal healthcare coverage i plan to hold the companies feet to the fire for universal health care
5441770 mommy tell me to draw a scene from any type of habitat and i will draw it
5441771 when i was first talking with xabi about a transfer we needed money after these months it is not a question of money we would have to have a massive offer because alonso is a great player
5441772 but if we sell one or two players we have enough money to bring in one more good player
5441773 dont forget we will need eight british players and the left footer we were talking about can play in three positions too
5441774 there is a fundamental issue of fairness raised by the way in which the appeal judge heard and determined the appeal
5441775 leader that god has blessed us with at this time
5441776 what i can do is say are there ways that we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies so that we actually are reducing the sense that women are seeking out abortions
5441777 that for a gay partners to want to visit each other in the hospital for the state to say you know what thats all right i dont think in any way inhibits my core beliefs about what marriage are i think my faith is strong enough and my marriage is strong enough that i can afford those civil rights to others even if i have a different perspective or a different view
5441778 now the one think that i think is very important is for us to have some humility in how we approach the issue of con fronting evil but you know a lot of evil has been perpetrated based on the claim that we were trying to confront evil q in the name of good a into the name of good and i think one thing thats very important is having some humility in recognizing that you know just because we think our intentions are good doesnt always mean that were going to be doing good
5441779 i would not nominate justice scalia although i dont think theres any doubt about his intellectual brilliance because he and i just disagree
5441780 taking care of our economy in the way we need to be
5441781 is the call of the media andrea mitchell etc theres something so wrong in america today and we need to start to come up with ways to try to fix her now

5441787 the passing of sensi has brought a deep sense of pain
5441788 we have lost a crucial reference point in the history of roma and of football but most of all a gentleman with real passion

5441791 my ultimate goal is to win championships and build a club that all of our fans will be proud of
5441792 while it has been a very difficult week i believe the end result is a very positive step forward for the galaxy
5441793 bruce is the best coach for the galaxy and certainly one of the best coaches in the history of the league
5441794 samir looks intelligent and capable of having good acceleration he sees a good vision of the game and that left flank suits him quite well
5441795 maybe there is a bit of robert pires in him because he looks to be able to change direction very easily and a little bit the same style of run he is a bit smaller but theres a bit of pires in there
5441796 he had a bad season last year because he had meningitis
5441797 he didnt recover properly for three months and then they rushed him back to play of course he was not at the expected level but the year before everybody wanted him
5441798 sometimes you have to be brave enough when everybody says he is not good

5441806 yesterday was the first time they have played together and there are signs today that it could be quite a good partnership which may get even better

5441832 were local we live here and work here and we support this country
5441833 were patriotic in the sense that we want this country to be as good as it can be
5441834 the brochures say nothing about dying and nothing about post traumatic stress syndrome
5441835 the issue is both sides should be allowed in or neither side should be
5441836 whats the fear that students are going to get indoctrinated
5441837 career days are to provide our students with steps they can take after graduation whether that be brown university bridgewater state college new england tractor trailer school or the army or navy
5441838 this group wants to have a debate thats not what these career days are for
5441839 if we open it up to them others seeing it as a forum for discussion will want to set up tables too
5441840 but most of the horror stories they told were from far off in other parts of the country not in bridgewater
5441841 because im not hearing complaints from people here in town im not sure we need to do anything about this
5441842 just as we would have if the garden club or any other group wanted to come in
5441843 we allow them to come and display antiwar messages and antirecruitment materials at the same time we allow military recruiters to come
5441844 also when we announce our back to school program we inform the students they can sign forms that night to opt out
5441845 why would he ever come here just to get a bunch of crowds to boo him he would be nuts to come up here
5441846 it would make the protests in europe look small i dont see any good purpose other than to check the box to say he was in all 50 states
5441847 obviously president bushs approval ratings in vermont are very low
5441848 i expect that president bush will visit here sometime before his term ends he is certainly welcome
5441849 i think he understands he is not wildly popular in vermont
5441850 with or without a picture of him with george bush its clear that governor douglas sees george bush as someone that he looks up to as his leader
5441851 i dont think it helps jim douglas at all politically to have a picture standing next to the president
5441852 he will be met with massive protests no matter where he appears in vermont he will face a massive protest
5441853 well one state always has to be the last one visited
5441854 vermont is a great state and if the president goes i hope to go with him but i dont have a schedule item to announce right now
5441855 i dont care if he is in vermont i just want him out of office and behind bars
5441856 you know i actually wish he would show up because i would like him to have an opportunity to meet people who think about their citizenship in a serious fashion
5441857 those of us who admire and are very respectful of george bush our president wish he would come and he is welcome to come at any time we understand we are a very small and not particularly significant state politically

5441864 theres 5 000 or more mushrooms in new brunswick probably more you really need an experienced collector along to keep you out of trouble

5441866 individuals taking antidepressants should be aware of the possible cognitive effects as they may affect performance in social academic and work settings as well as driving abilities

5441887 la concertaci n siempre ha sido capaz de ponerse de acuerdo en resolver este tema lo ha resuelto en cuatro ocasiones anteriores con bastante xito y creo que es un desaf o que tienen los distintos partidos
5441888 me parece que el planteamiento de jos miguel como todas las cosas que l hace es muy razonable y creo que si es posible para esa fecha es espl ndido en todo caso es un tema que corresponde a los partidos pol ticos resolver
5441889 somos partidarios de un solo candidato presidencial y lo decimos hoy d a pensamos que es necesario lo m s pronto posible que todos los partidos lo digan y tambi n estamos disponibles para definir el mecanismo hoy d a estamos disponibles sea para primarias ciudadanas abiertas sea para un procedimiento de encuestas ciudadanas
5441890 eso lo tiene que definir las instancias del partido pero yo creo que los mecanismos no son dogmas lo importante es que seamos capaces de mantener una candidatura nica pero hacerlo en serio no terminar con doble candidatura como terminamos para las municipales

5441900 with regards to wiiware im evaluating that right now and to be honest i think a 2d castlevania game on wiiware might be the right approach
5441901 this lets our customers buy bandwidth more in line with what they require
5441902 our customers are saying to us that mobile is important to them

5441907 we got an anonymous tip and sent two wardens to the house
5441908 it just fell apart on this guy from that point
5441909 its really not that common for somebody thats a young guy to have so many poached deer
5441910 this was a significant case just based on the number of animals he poached
5441911 we get poaching cases on a fairly regular basis normally its one deer and somebody got caught when they were stopped for another reason
5441912 we lost a lot of positions in the last six or seven years
5441913 when people are retiring were not able to replace them
5441914 the calls are increasing but there are fewer officers to respond
5441915 more deer more bear more salmon and more sturgeon are being poached black market trade in animal parts is increasing
5441916 we need 1 000 game wardens to appropriately respond to these activities statewide
5441917 it dawned on some of the staff here that we recently had a similar debate on special session pay back in 2004
5441918 dems at the time wanted special session pay waived but many gop led by then sen tom sawyer as well as rep josh tardy and sen carol weston pushed for the special session pay and won in court
5441919 the maine legislature should take immediate action to guarantee that our most vulnerable neighbors will stay warm this winter and we should do so without placing a greater burden on maine taxpayers
5441920 the superior court found the retroactive application was taking away their vested rights
5441921 it was about a power grab by democrats who werent interested in working toward compromise with republicans on the budget
5441922 it was an important battle to wage because we believe the interests of maine people are best served by bipartisan two thirds budgets it resulted in a complete shutdown of communications for the rest of the legislative year
5441923 congress is elected by secret ballot she believes that employees should have the same right when it comes to determining union representation
5441924 it didnt take him long to become just another portland liberal
5441925 in 2007 the legislature cut your funding your officials have pleaded to get money and that is why youre only open two days a week
5441926 when the head lady walks into your office and says that your clinic will be closing in the next 30 days thats a shock
5441927 we are at 110 000 and we only need 7 000 more
5441928 his life is rooted in rural oregon it just gives him that perspective
5441929 it may give more choice in the primary election but less choice in the general election and thats where we elect our leaders were not sure what the disease is but the cure is obviously worse than the disease
5441930 ive had enough kick my ass fuck me up ill do anything you want
5441931 if drilling is good then drilling and mining is better
5441932 chan ge change give me some f ki ng change
5441933 theres no way im going to reopen the colorado river compact
5441934 opening up the colorado river water compact is a non starter for coloradans it is the only protection we have from the more politically powerful downstream states on the colorado river
5441935 im convinced mccain intended to make general statements about further discussions on the colorado river not reopen the compact
5441936 an infestation such as we have today is not a normal occurrence
5441937 and its interesting because the far left of the environmental movement will assert that it is a natural activity but it isnt it is a function of national forests public lands that are not managed properly theyre not managed in the way to achieve an objective of forest health
5441938 hundreds of millions of feet of timber are sold from the forest each year
5441939 that is why the forest is protected the timber is used
5441940 i carry this with me a lot because people forget
5441941 the mission of the forest service has really gone by the wayside over the last 50 or 60 years
5441942 consider were living in a modern age trying to process 200 000 guests into the country every year for a variety of purposes
5441943 and doing this with paper and pen that is the source of frustration for so many people and why after a couple years of frustration people outside the u
5441944 prequalify preidentify foreign labor before they come to the united states
5441945 i think hes down to earth i think hes just more in touch with the people hes more like one of us i would say than some of the other governors weve had
5441946 i can even listen to that song the first time i heard it i was in total shock it promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting when it comes on the radio i bow my head and pray
5441947 she is our daughter and we love her and cant cut her out of our lives but we strongly disagree with how she is conducting herself and she knows how disappointed we are
5441948 the message she is promoting is about homosexuality which the bible clearly states is a sin
5441949 some of her outfits are too revealing and her father has had words with her about it she changed when she went to la and is going through a period of rebellion katy is not a homosexual and has just been led astray by hollywood
5441950 shes told me oh mom im not going to turn into amy winehouse but i pray all the time god will help her find salvation
5441951 the mans hands and feet were tied with ropes and a cloth was found inside his mouth
5441952 no one wants to see the devastation i saw my friend and his family go through we have to lend our support to this campaign
5441953 you dont expect situations that are happening whereby people go to school in the morning and then you never see them again
5441954 we have got to help we have got a voice that kids listen to it is unfortunate it is part of life part of culture these days and this is why we want to get involved we want to make a change
5441955 in the past maybe there wasnt a strong enough deterrent for carrying knives
5441956 it is not always the person intending to hurt someone who gets injured people carrying the knives also get hurt
5441957 boredom can set in a lot of times there is a lot of peer pressure and then something happens that everyone regrets
5441958 young people need to understand that carrying a knife just like carrying a gun is dangerous and wrong
5441959 but government and the police cant solve this problem by themselves we need to change the way young people think about knives we need families and communities working together and we need influential role models
5441960 i think sen obama was extremely generous and i think its good not because it will display any disunity but because it honors the hard work of so many people who supported sen clinton
5441961 many of the pennsylvania delegates worked their heart out for sen clinton and theyre excited to cast a vote for her from my vantage point that will be closure for them
5441962 i think it will have the cathartic effect that both sen clinton and sen obama are hoping to have
5441963 early on i said i would cast my ballot for sen clinton
5441964 im going to cast my ballot for her and then the moment i cast my vote im going to continue to enthusiastically support sen obama its going to be a good release for all of us

5441992 its a very complicated issue but we can push for people to not be afraid to speak tell someone if youre a victim nobody deserves to be abused

5441995 a lot of people have given me tips on bristol
5441996 mike and johnny have probably run there more than anyone in the series so they know the track well i just hope that i adapt quickly it should be a lot of fun and if we are there in the end well see what we can do
5441997 bristol is a place that all the teams have marked on their calendars
5441998 trip and the guys on the no 23 exide batteries team have done a tremendous job this year preparing trucks that win races this is fun momentum is such an important thing in this sport we have been on a roll and know we have to keep it up for the last 10 races
5441999 ive attended several races at bristol you get the sense that the place is awesome by simply walking through the gate i had a chance to turn laps in an arca car at bristol during a private test earlier this month we got really fast near the end of the session i am confident that will help me be prepared to be very competitive in the zaxbys truck on wednesday
5442000 we are going to take the same truck john wes raced at milwaukee a few months ago bristol is a wild place and stuff happens pretty quickly there so im glad he got the chance to test there a bit before our race well need to make the most of our practice time on wednesday and make sure the zaxbys team has good stops during the race to keep him in front of the wrecks
5442001 ive never raced at bristol but i was able to test an arca car there last month the amount of banking for a track that small is wild and its probably one of the neatest tracks ive been to in my career running a half mile track requires a lot of patience because its hard to pass you have to be smart and patient and let the race come to you it usually doesnt work for a rookie to try to bully their way around there it might work for some of the veterans but our strategy is going to be patience mike beam has had a lot of success there winning with mark martin in 06 and he should have won with travis kvapil last year i know hell give me a fast truck so we just need to let the race come to us
5442002 bristol is a tough track but it can be a lot of fun when you have a
5442003 the track picked up speed and we were focusing on our qualifying setup so thats why we slipped in the rundown
5442004 our car is very stable and im really looking forward to the rest of the day
5442005 the guys had the window net up but it unlatched itself for whatever reason one of those things that you dont expect to happen the guys are working on it to make sure we dont have any issues for the race well take 11th and go to the front
5442006 every time we seem like were going to have a great day bad luck always strikes im proud of my sheltra motorsports team for giving me a great racecar our performance was stellar compared to the finishing result also want to thank our marketing partners for their continued support our time is coming well go get them in duquoin
5442007 its a little nerve racking starting mid field but i know we have a good car and as long as nothing happens right in front of us well be able to get through the field pretty quickly
5442008 there is a lack of total rear grip im having to race on the bottom of the track i cant turn up on top
5442009 we raced with heavy hearts this weekend we did the best we could as a team to get through it
5442010 any racer who watches the truck series says man that looks like a lot of fun and i wish i could do that
5442011 this gives me a chance to log some laps at bristol as well ive never raced at bristol so any seat time is priceless hopefully we can learn a lot and have some fun
5442012 we wanted to win here since the beginning of the year
5442013 this is the biggest win we have had and it just feels great all the best drivers come here to race there were 28 tough racecars here tonight and anyone could have won it means a lot to be holding the trophy
5442014 we dont get to practice pit stops much all my guys volunteer to help us out and we are going to make mistakes
5442015 sometimes you just have to go on and make up for it it aint their fault i cant blame them because they work too hard for me and they dont blame me when i make a mistake
5442016 they were racing pretty hard and i knew they would with ten laps to go guys were kind of getting pushy and they got into each other i got hit from behind and i just held it on the bottom when i got to turn two i was the leader
5442017 i have had nights like that i have been spun with ten to go and on the last lap i know how bad it feels luck was on our side tonight we have had good cars down here this year and we havent been able to show for it we have taken a little time off to regroup and get things together we are really happy to come out with a win
5442018 trying to get webpage to look the same in multiple browsers and oss

5442020 i think americas greatest moral failure in my lifetime has been that we still dont live by that basic precept in mataw that whatever you for a least of my broars you do for me
5442021 my greatest moral failing amp i have been an imperfect person is a failure of my first marriage
5442022 let me just ask a related question to that we got a bill right here in california proposition 8 thats going on because a court overturned this definition of marriage was a supreme court of california wrong
5442023 winning bristol was awesome weve run well there so we expect to have a competitive run bristol has been a great place for me and hopefully we can be competitive when we unload there wednesday night it is definitely one of the races this team looks forward to every year
5442024 driving at bristol is like running around in a punch bowl
5442025 winning the race there in 2005 was one of my favorite memories from bristol being able to make races there early in my career in the

5442030 all of our girls have an amazing ability to crossover between the adult world and the mainstream world very few adult performers can do that i really believe the lines are blurring between the two industries look at the success of the r rated version of pirates gabriella just made that jump and the fact that she is an adult star is only helping her it gives her an edge
5442031 i didnt get into adult film to jump into mainstream work i love to have sex and make pornos and i love the idea of people watching me when im getting pounded it would be great if i could continue to do mainstream things but i have no intention to stop making films like sexy hot my scenes with erik everhard and johnny sins were amazing i have never been fucked like that so why would i ever want to stop
5442032 ill be taking cold showers every time i see her
5442033 the show provided five scenes full of tease and heated sexual action and was another step in the evolution of contract cutie gabriella fox gabriella fox sexy hot showed the lead as being sexy and hot her wow factor still on the rise at this writing the technical values were solid and the bts had some of the self deprecating humor the crew is known for
5442034 first of all i am glad to be back racing with the
5442035 as far as bristol goes well it should be pretty interesting i have never seen the track so it should be a lot of fun i have gotten a few pointers here and there from different drivers and hopefully their advice will help im running with a great team and a great group of guys so we should be pretty good here
5442036 both of these blogs should be cut immediately from the list of credentialed sites neither functions as a responsible media outlet and both offend catholics as well as others to allow them access to the democratic national convention sends a message to catholics they will not forget we look for leah daughtry ceo of the convention to nix them asap

5442039 it means a lot to me for him to take a track where he runs so well and enjoys racing on and give me this opportunity is pretty awesome i always look to kevin and even ron hornaday and jack sprague for advice and how to better my driving this is a track where they all have wins either in the nationwide series or truck series
5442040 i have i mean obviously weve had our ups and downs theres a couple of races where i felt like i could have done a better job in the car give a little bit better feedback in practice but ive had some races where i felt like ive run extremely well and not had the finish that we needed due to circumstances that racing gives you
5442041 you can learn a lot of things about what changes to do to the car pit strategies how the race plays out theres a lot to learn when i first started running in the nationwide series the first 20 laps seemed to mean a lot then halfway through the race you realize the first half didnt mean as much and now its time to go racing the last half so ive learned that too you want to maintain track position but you dont want to fall too far back in the field at the beginning you want to maintain as much as you can stay on the lead lap and be there in the top 10 to top five range at the end of the race when it counts if you can do that it usually ends up being a good day

5442047 katy knows how i feel we are a very outspoken family and she knows how disappointed her father and i are i cant even listen to that song the first time i heard it i was in total shock when it comes on the radio i bow my head and pray
5442048 katy is our daughter and we love her but we strongly disagree with how she is conducting herself at the moment
5442049 we cannot cut her out of our lives as she is our child but she knows we disagree strongly with what she is doing and the message she is promoting regarding homosexuality which the bible clearly states is a sin

5442054 we wanted to come up with an idea that paid proper respect to this phase of our career while at the same time gave our fans something truly unique and different many of these songs have never been played in front of an audience before so i think were going to be freaking out at the same time our fans are its going to be a major challenge were psyched our fans have been so loyal and amazing we figured they deserved this
5442055 were really looking forward to going deep and revisiting not only the songs but also the story
5442056 interestingly enough us going over all the old material seems to be influencing our writing of the next record which were sort of doing simultaneously and to me that seems appropro since the next story is the prequel to the amory wars

5442070 i think were in a difference of opinion because hes of the opinion that we can just push a few buttons and we get all of that
5442071 because of the things he asked for all of the police reports for all of the 170 or so taser incidents we have a big problem with that because we have a closed portion of those records he seems to think he can come in and look through our records and thats not possible
5442072 ive been labeled by people in this community as the taser man
5442073 the only reason i am doing this is because people have come up to me and told me about incidents that happened to them and i want to see if theyre true
5442074 i pushed it kind of close i accomplished my job and i get to run tomorrow top two is favored and that is the main focus because you get inside lanes for the next rounds

5442086 our goal is to get the majority of the evidence to the lab today
5442087 she moved to columbia because her sons are both gifted
5442088 they both started mu when they were 16 and she wanted them to be able to live at home she had really committed her life to raising her sons
5442089 she had become conscious of what she ate and had lost weight recently she came across as very professional and intelligent she definitely came across as friendly
5442090 i was horrified i think what really hit me was that she had really dedicated her life to her boys i wouldnt have expected that she seemed like one of the most stable caring parents ive ever met
5442091 it will give us the context really to provide the kind of support to our hospital structure that has been needed for some time
5442092 get the kind of strategic advice policy advice regulatory advice and general health care perspective that doesnt come either from a curators perspective
5442093 my hats off to the new president for moving in this direction
5442094 the main thing is that it adds a single individual that is responsible and accountable for all of the components that make up an academic medical center and i believe that is the preferred structure
5442095 i think it addresses some issues that dr crist raised and im very hopeful that this will improve things
5442096 i think it represents real opportunity for coordination and planning that we really need
5442097 i am very proud of this health system they have done a terrific turn around in the past few years and they are working harder for less from the general assembly
5442098 this is the busiest time just making certain our house is ready for the kids to come in
5442099 were getting our house cleaned up for the kids to come back
5442100 we have a lot of people working very hard to make sure buildings are ready when students come
5442101 our big crunch is just doing the necessary paperwork to get the children actually enrolled
5442102 we have to make sure we have their birth certificates to prove theyre eligible to be in school their proof of residences and make sure their shot records are up to date
5442103 we have to figure out where children have gone sometimes they move out of town and havent notified the board office its imperative to know where a child goes so it requires a little investigative work
5442104 our challenge is to keep buildings presentable clean and safe
5442105 normally this time of year is pretty darned dry but weve had to put a lot more effort into the mowing this year than we have in the past
5442106 we do not sponsor partner much like we do with hundreds of web sites any site hosting copyrighted streaming content in this case they are not actually hosting the content we view services that dont actually host content as if they were a search engine in these instances the web publisher is not violating our terms today however obviously theres moves to be made here as an industry and as those change so will our terms
5442107 i wouldnt mind doing something with whats his name again james blunt
5442108 imagine him on one of these weird beats doing a chorus or something and being so earnest and sincere
5442109 its a pretty offensive text and they seem to have written it for idiots not responsible drivers
5442110 when someone is at the wheel their gender is irrelevant they either follow the rules or they dont
5442111 our camping world chevrolet was honestly really good all day
5442112 we ran in the top 10 most of the day but we just dont have the finish to show it its frustrating we started good qualified on the outside pole and ran good for three quarters of the race but got caught in one of those racing deals well go to bristol now and try to capitalize there
5442113 he also said fuck this job i want fuck all to do with this job
5442114 i wanted to go back down the steps i dont know why i did not have the courage to do so if i did he taliep would still be alive today
5442115 i found myself in the wrong place at the wrong time
5442116 he said he did not want anything to do with any money that was taken from the house because its blood money and he washes his hands of any responsibility
5442117 police rushed to the scene and a shoot out ensued one robber was shot twice in the body while others managed to flee
5442118 we unwrapped her and felt she was moving we didnt believe it at first then she began holding my mothers hand and then we saw her open her mouth
5442119 we dont know how to explain this so when we dont know how to explain things in the medical world we call it a miracle and this is probably what happened
5442120 doctor mwanawasa had been making steady progress until last night when his condition suddenly changed and required intervention
5442121 rasheed is my favorite piston and i also wanted as the middle name somebody off the bench so i chose amir johnson
5442122 saya menyadari kami punya banyak pekerjaan rumah dan saya optimistis bahwa dengan dukungan manajemen staf pelatih dan para pemain kami akan meningkatkan posisi tim ini supaya lolos ke babak playoff mls musim ini
5442123 this budget runs the risk of putting california on the brink of bankruptcy it is time for democrats to take their heads out of the sand
5442124 so we just left a message and asked them to call us back when they had a chance hopefully they will
5442125 and in 15 years we also maybe arrive at features available on irc and usenet ten years ago like crosspost elimination better aggregation watch and kill filter plus scoring sigh it is not that the information is not there
5442126 dia akan bermain di musim ini dengan kami saya sangat yakin itu dia terlihat sangat hidup sangat senang dan penuh keinginan pelatih bernd schuster mengatakan kepada saya bahwa dia berlatih sangat baik
5442127 it didnt take him long to become just another portland liberal
5442128 in 2007 the legislature cut your funding your officials have pleaded to get money and that is why youre only open two days a week
5442129 when the head lady walks into your office and says that your clinic will be closing in the next 30 days thats a shock
5442130 we are at 110 000 and we only need 7 000 more
5442131 we have an ambulance we have good volunteers and emts but a lot of the elderly do not have transport to get to a doctor
5442132 his life is rooted in rural oregon it just gives him that perspective
5442133 it may give more choice in the primary election but less choice in the general election and thats where we elect our leaders were not sure what the disease is but the cure is obviously worse than the disease
5442134 that would have meant that there would be limited international recognition for south african pilot licences and aviation proficiency certificates
5442135 this would have led to the saa not being able to deploy its routes in america
5442136 it was jordaan who had convinced the inspectors from the faa and icaa to give the sacaa an extension
5442137 the reason for the faa and icaas actions was the lowering of the technical standards of saa technical
5442138 that means that there is an accident waiting to happen
5442139 the freedom front plus had already in april of this year warned the government and requested it to take action at the time we said that the shortage of expertise in the aviation industry has the potential to force the saa to a standstill
5442140 airlines have to adhere to international standards and excuses by local officials will not be accepted to lose 300 workers in two years proves the incompetence of management to take action
5442141 otherwise we will be confronted with a catastrophe which will cost many lives
5442142 se refiere al terremoto que seg n los expertos suceder un d a en california y que causar una enorme destrucci n similar al

5442169 when wind and solar power do start to come on line
5442170 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5442171 the city is a cold place now people are fearful
5442172 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5442173 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly
5442174 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5442175 it has been only 10 days since you faced a cowardly aggression
5442176 i am sure that such a well done effective and peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military
5442177 the world realized that even now there are political freaks who were ready to kill innocent people for the sake of political fashions and who compensated for their own stupidity by eliminating a whole nation
5442178 perhaps a more realistic approach would be to expand the ipl model with franchises in places like usa japan china and europe that way competitive matches are guaranteed in those countries and an opportunity is created for an increased audience for cricket on television in those regions by taking this approach it would also accelerate the development of young homegrown players from those countries who would eventually go on to play in a competitive national team when that time arrives it would be appropriate to start thinking about cricket as an olympic sport
5442179 he was essentially the librarian for a myriad of images that were distributed to like minded individuals both in this country and elsewhere
5442180 this is really a young man who has fallen into that stereotype of a rather sad and lonely teenager who spends too much time in a darkened room in front of a computer screen
5442181 he has not had much life experience to get himself mature
5442182 he just clearly wasnt paying attention and turned right into the bus
5442183 for the most part everybody was on the bus and they just walked themselves out

5442185 universal code and there are always hidden reasons for anything to happen including the
5442186 i particularly hope he strengthens his economic message even senator obama can speak more clearly and specifically about the kitchen table bread and butter issues like high energy costs
5442187 its fine to tell people about hope and change but you have to have plenty of concrete pragmatic ideas that bring hope and change to life
5442188 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5442189 democrats should take a deep breath and realize that there are a group of voters who wont make up their mind about a candidate until deep in the fall
5442190 and there are 18 states that are battlegrounds for a reason and theyll be decided by 2 to 4 points i dont care about national polls
5442191 i think senator obama is a motivational speaker but at the end of the day i dont think that will translate into votes and certainly not the image of strength that ronald reagan had
5442192 florida has not yet been locked down by either candidate or all but won by either candidate but i think obamas inability to prove his experience or prove that he owns a political issue far more than mccain is a real problem for him
5442193 the one area he still needs credibility in is experience and picking an
5442194 it wouldnt be bad if he came out early and said who his secretary of defense and secretary of state would be that would address and stabilize the concerns about his experience
5442195 in rural parts of georgia and the south there is still some fear about people who look different from themselves
5442196 and theres also healing left to do among women who wanted to see the day that a woman was elected president
5442197 i would really like to see him do things in tennessee that would help in other working class and blue collar places like ohio
5442198 job security and health care are huge here he needs to come to the aisle of home depot and show them that a harvard graduate which i am as well knows how to help them

5442306 however in order to reap the full benefits from connectivity in a long lasting manner underlying issues of policy affordability and technology need to be addressed
5442307 the book looks at the recent experiences of some countries in emerging asia that are improving connectivity the central argument is that connectivity is held back not by technology but by policy and regulatory barriers
5442308 our work on regulation in south asia is driven by the idea that what is appropriate for our countries are simple easy to implement low cost methodologies that is one reason we are developing alternative methods of regulation based on benchmarks the comparative data that we have developed can be used for benchmark regulation

5442316 some of the inhibiting policy factors that have contributed to this large urban rural divide are changing now however
5442317 overall we think india has a more robust policy and regulatory system than others though of course it could be better the very powerful role of the department of telecom is problematic
5442318 evidence based policy intervention is something that lirneasia lives by our approach has been successful in influencing policy changes leading to outcomes such as leased line prices dropping substantially in indonesia and the removal of the regressive component of a proposed mobile tax in sri lanka for example this has finally enable more people to get connected to icts
5442319 pleading for free or subsidized services for their projects is counterproductive multiple suppliers are the best long term option for civil society organizations as well as consumers
5442320 the bottom of the pyramid in emerging countries in asia are keen users
5442321 people have a finite amount of money in their communication budgets if that is taken up be cheap mobile services there is less left for other things
5442322 this is something bangladeshs grameen village phone ladies have found now that phone ownership is catching on at the bottom of the pyramid what csos need to do is develop new products and services that will allow access to a larger share of the budget not just the communication portion
5442323 given the growing number of services becoming available on mobiles particularly with regards to mobile payments which has huge potential for socio economic development what needs to be addressed is a regulatory framework for the same

5442327 the contamination that were talking about here today is contamination which is on the other side of the fence which separates the park from the river
5442328 for the past number of years the dep has been sampling the river bottom and the river banks and has been concerned about the high levels of pcb contamination weve put together a project to remediate that here
5442329 there really is nothing to worry about from a public health perspective the contamination were targeting here is deep within the bank and within the river bottom
5442330 the bottom line is that this park should have been adequately cleaned up the first time it was not assessed properly like many of the properties around pittsfield we continue to find pcbs that have already been cleaned up and this in an outrage and it should not exist
5442331 what a real man cant enjoy a martini with his dinner

5442333 with so many gen yers still living at home with mum and dad its not surprising they are less affected by an economic downturn in comparison to home owners and young families
5442334 and the cooking skills they have been taught at home have well and truly come to waste with 29 per cent spending more on takeaways
5442335 i think micah needs to come out of the firing line
5442336 adam has done really well in pre season and we cant really afford many more of the basic errors we made on saturday
5442337 he had the problem at training on thursday and hopefully it will have settled down by tonight
5442338 they both need to get a bit fitter the problem with the pair of them is that for all their fantastic football playing the pair of them gives you very little cover for the back four because they are both creative forward thinking midfielders
5442339 its a problem i hope to solve at some point but dave certainly needs to get fitter the big plus with him is that he is really enjoying his football because he had fallen out of love with the game for a long time
5442340 as well as his goals kyle is a real all round team player holding the ball up well and the fact that he stepped up to take a penalty on his home debut when we were 1 0 down tells you a lot about his character
5442341 he also has good awareness and there is plenty more to come from him
5442342 its no gigg lane and will be more of a battle than saturdays game
5442343 they have an experienced manager in ken mckenna who has been in charge of tns in european football people might read something into the fact that they lost their first game at guiseley on saturday but i think guiseley will be one of the teams up there in contention at the end of the season
5442344 it will be a really tough game and we will do well to get anything out of it

5442360 everything went very smoothly and i look forward to taking more courses online excellent vision from multnomah to provide this opportunity for those of us still in ministry that live some distance from campus
5442361 i loved this class the books the prof the chatting the case studies but especially the discussion questions those required specific thought amp study
5442362 this course was an excellent compliment to my on campus studies and the on line classes offer an added measure of flexibility to scheduling overall this has been an excellent experience and i would highly recommend this to future students thanks for a job very well done
5442363 answering the questions online and the chat times made the course feel more personal than on campus classes feel sometimes

5442403 now this whole musharraf excuse is behind us now people are going to be focusing on their performance
5442404 we believe that respect for the democratic and constitutional processes in that country is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism
5442405 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5442406 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5442407 the government had been blaming musharraf for inflation power cuts and the weak economy and since now he has resigned we hope that the government will take steps to make our life better
5442408 selling our innocent brothers and sisters to america for dollars
5442409 his resignation clears the way for our government to get on with providing to the people of pakistan basic social services economic opportunities political security and law and order
5442410 its a huge challenge and they cannot face it individually its very important for them to work together and i think they know that
5442411 america wants some immediate decisions on fighting terrorism and i dont think they will be able to concentrate on that
5442412 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual
5442413 whatever one might say it may be difficult for the politicians to give him the indemnity
5442414 omg my parents are making my life hell i hate living at home

5442433 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5442434 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5442435 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5442436 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5442437 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5442438 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5442439 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5442440 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5442441 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5442442 it takes many months and many many meals to produce the only national guide in the country
5442443 one of the great pleasures is the opportunity to celebrate the extraordinary individuals the people who make our restaurant scene the envy of the world
5442444 it may be interesting to see whether there was any discussion about the size of rate cuts and their relationship to bank lending rates which seem to have become the interest rates that the rba has become most interested in for policy purposes
5442445 there is absolutely no excuse for banks not to pass an official rate cut from the reserve bank in full should that occur

5442456 seeing such a long outage during the very first few days makes us wonder if a free solution provided by google is actually pro enough for us we cannot correspond with schools in africa or partners in denmark and afford being out of mail for a whole day
5442457 i can give them a lot of credit for providing a free service but they lose some of that when saying your e mail is totally inaccessible and were not going to tell you why or for how long its arrogant im a system administrator so i deserve to know a little more
5442458 were quite busy leading up to the convention i have relied on gmail not only for e mail but for my primary contact list and was totally isolated for more than a day
5442459 i was on client deadlines and had to work around for re routes and resends of e mails from those clients
5442460 i do remind myself that im not paying for the service and that theres a level of patience and adequate backup youve got to have when youre getting something for free

5442471 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5442472 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5442473 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5442474 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5442475 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5442476 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5442477 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5442478 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5442479 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5442480 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5442481 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5442482 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5442483 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5442484 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5442485 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5442486 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5442487 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5442488 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5442489 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5442490 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5442491 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5442492 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5442493 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5442494 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5442495 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5442496 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5442497 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5442498 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5442499 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5442500 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did

5442503 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5442504 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5442505 this is a planning took where all things are going
5442506 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5442507 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5442508 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5442509 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5442510 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5442511 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5442512 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5442513 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5442514 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5442515 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5442516 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5442517 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5442518 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5442519 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5442520 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5442521 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5442522 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5442523 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that

5442704 cant be a crime because heavenly father is the one that tells warren when a girl is ready to get married
5442705 they couldnt find abuse the first time it came up whats changed
5442706 i believe that the events in georgia caused the government finally to understand that black is black and white is white
5442707 against the allies of countries that have nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
5442708 we have made another important step to increase polands security
5442709 and it is the russians who convince us how important it is as our sad experience teaches us the louder they protest against something we want to do the more certain it is that it lies in our best interest
5442710 you may fulfill your dream about hegemony in caucasus but youd better bid farewell to another dream about having central europe hanging in a strategic vacuum we cannot effectively stop you in georgia but central europe has been and will be a part of the west
5442711 we would start with a battery under u s command but made available to the polish army then there would be a second phase involving equipping the polish army with missiles
5442712 higher education act 2008 or hr4137 for more information hey i cant do all the work for you
5442713 i guess if youre making 3 million a year youre middle class
5442714 once we understood that no threat was perceived out of there in the key central georgia city of gori
5442715 i would like to distinguish two notions the notion of withdrawal and that of pullout
5442716 so in a telephone conversation between our president and french president nicolas sarkozy they spoke only about the pullout i hope you notice the subtlety we are not talking about withdrawal here
5442717 there is no indication to us that they have begun to pull back
5442718 if somebody thinks that he can with impunity murder our citizens murder our soldiers and officers who are peacekeepers we will never allow this
5442719 all those who try to do something like that will get a crushing response
5442720 we have all possibilities for this economic political and military
5442721 now it is essentially important to restore order and discipline in the republic
5442722 most of them left in a hurry leaving their homes and property unattended

5442724 i am leaving with the satisfaction that whatever i could do for this country i did it with integrity
5442725 i am a human too i could have made mistakes but i believe that the people will forgive me
5442726 we will continue to work with the pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on pakistans future and its most urgent needs including stemming the growth of extremism addressing food and energy shortages and improving economic stability
5442727 it should have happened much earlier the dictatorship should have been done away with sometime ago
5442728 pave the way for true democracy to flourish in pakistan
5442729 the bush musharraf relationship really was key to the whole history of pakistan over the last eight or nine years
5442730 it was very personalized diplomacy and it was buttressed by a hefty dose of backing from vice president cheneys office it created an over reliance on one personality rather than a system
5442731 we were basically stuck up the canyon without our rafts
5442732 we had no supplies no food and very little water we lost everything
5442733 were not as concerned about it as we initially were
5442734 wir h tten es besser machen m ssen wir waren nahe dran jetzt m ssen wir uns damit begn gen dass wir um bronze spielen mit einer medaille nach hause zu kommen w re toll aber wir haben sie noch nicht
5442735 die mannschaft hat alles aus sich herausgeholt es hat einfach nicht gereicht
5442736 wir hatten es in der ersten halbzeit selbst in der hand
5442737 the settlement goes to both sides the settlement is for outstanding claims on the part of libya as well as the united states
5442738 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5442739 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5442740 i hope he intends to honor the pledge this time
5442741 the word of the russian president needs to be upheld by his forces or people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5442742 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5442743 i think we just have to work with our allies and above all we need to look at what russia does from here on in terms of the severity of whatever measures would be considered
5442744 my hope is that their actions in the weeks and months ahead will provide some reassurance that these actions in georgia are an aberration and not symptomatic of a new approach by russia to the rest of the world and to their neighbors that looks a lot like the old soviet union
5442745 now that president medvedev has reportedly signed the cease fire agreement i assume that russian forces are going to begin to withdraw expeditiously
5442746 president medvedev of russia has now signed on to the terms of this agreement and thats an important development its a hopeful step
5442747 continue to rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
5442748 these regions are within the internationally recognized boundaries of georgia
5442749 and there will have to be a negotiated solution on that basis
5442750 we do want to send a strong message of support for georgia
5442751 georgia is going to emerge from this and its infrastructure will be rebuilt
5442752 when this requirement came up we had to figure out how do we make this happen quickly
5442753 we had to get the georgian troops back and sustain what we have going in iraq and afghanistan
5442754 in the 36 hours from notification to when we started flying missions it all came together
5442755 it was a total teamwork effort from a planning perspective
5442756 it was also a great team effort on the part of aircrew members maintainers and loaders
5442757 i think we had about 36 to 48 hours to plan this
5442758 we got wind of the mission and began working closely with our contacts at u s european command
5442759 we wanted the missions to be fast visible and effective
5442760 we work with our customers across the globe and depending on what needs to be moved and how quickly it needs to be there we will find the right mode of transportation
5442761 sealift is a possibility and we are working with the navy s military sealift command to examine the possibilities
5442762 in this case in a two day effort there was hardly any impact on sustainment operations or deployments in iraq afghanistan or elsewhere
5442763 had it been a longer term operation over time there would be some degradation but that would not happen to troops in contact
5442764 to my mind the real beauty of it was our young men and women who maintain and launch and load and fly these airplanes that they were able to respond and make this move happen
5442765 they took a chance because thats what they were called to do and they did a phenomenal job
5442766 it all boils down to we have a mission to do and we do it
5442767 our motto out here is a promise made is a promise kept in this case america made a promise to an ally and we kept that promise
5442768 although i love this company more than almost anything in the world
5442769 i want you to know who is to blame for this conflict and thats mr saakashvili who started this war and who is an aggressor 2000 people were killed in one day
5442770 i wanted the americans to know that russia didnt start that war
5442771 we took that bcm3543 chip at the core and basically cable ized it weve been working on this for a good ten months this whole program has been under a very aggressive development cycle
5442772 there might be potential in south america europe china and india
5442773 we encourage canadians around the world to pick up an application for the mail in special ballot now available at any canadian diplomatic mission or download the form from our web site

5442780 commercial airlines regularly put most of their jets into service during the peak summer tourist months so we anticipated a slower season now our customers are back on schedule we are able to put these valuable employees back to work
5442781 when the fuel crisis hit we started getting cancellations and schedule delays from all our customers this forced us to announce the first round of layoffs in the company since september 11 2001
5442782 our company instituted leadership training for all its managers and project leads two years ago with a strategy for continual improvement we have developed a highly skilled workforce
5442783 behind the world food crisis is a global freshwater crisis expected to rapidly worsen as climate change impacts intensify
5442784 irrigation fed agriculture provides 45 per cent of the worlds food supplies and without it we could not feed our planets population of six billion people
5442785 millions of people depend on freshwater fisheries as a major food source
5442786 freshwater food stocks can provide up to 80 per cent of dietary protein for the 60 million people of the mekong basin for example and thats just one river
5442787 freshwater systems are home to around 40 per cent of all the species on earth
5442788 and our impact is shown by the fact that we are losing these species faster than any other
5442789 a global treaty for co operatively managing rivers and lakes that cross or form borders is still languishing in limbo more than a decade after being approved by a clear majority in the united nations
5442790 water management for human needs alone is damaging the natural systems we all depend on
5442791 maintaining the health of freshwater ecosystems has to become one of the major aims of freshwater management generally
5442792 we are also concerned that the world continues to mainly discuss adaptation to climate change rather than doing it
5442793 we have been doing it all over the world and we have found that that improving the health of freshwater ecosystems now makes a great contribution to improving their resilience to climate impacts in the future
5442794 it is ironic that currently it is not foresight and planning but major natural disasters that lead to significant efforts to repair damaged rivers and wetlands foresight and planning now will reduce the risk and damage from future extreme weather events while having many economic social and environmental benefits
5442795 even this tiny proportion however would be enough for humans to live on earth if the water cycle was properly functioning and if we managed our water use wisely

5442820 were the youth lacrosse association that produces the worlds best swimmers
5442821 apparently he liked lacrosse he may have even been a goalie
5442822 he carried a lacrosse stick around all the time but the thing about michael playing lacrosse he wanted to play the whole field so the pool was a much better a much wiser choice
5442823 certainly the fairfield job is one i couldnt be more interested in
5442824 being a connecticut native having coached there and having worked with ted spencer
5442825 guy who cleans up the set of a porn movie
5442826 theyre playing good fundamental baseball guys are getting good swings at the plate theyve come a long way theyre going to be a force to be reckoned to very soon
5442827 this is a game that takes a little time to understand every time ive seen them play theyve gotten better
5442828 we had the game won in the ninth inning lost it and fought back we gave up for runs in the second tiebreaker and then scored five it showed a lot of heart the way we battled and never quit
5442829 so far in the olympics weve competed and thats what we came here for
5442830 what we want to do is win respect play hard and show people in china that were making big big progress and we have
5442831 we have to prepare a whole lot more than team usa were playing with less talented players but it doesnt mean we cant compete that was the big thing for the six weeks we played in arizona then two weeks in new england just preparing our guys to be here in front of crowds and be able to make the routine plays
5442832 i think everybody was worried that when you have a host team like china that youre going to have some lopsided games said heid coordinator of international special projects for the mariners
5442833 but this baseball event has had no weak link in it
5442834 they do just enough of the right things and they play as a team
5442835 they know their limitations jim has done a great job with the hitting and has got them to a point where people have to make good pitches to get them out and they have some speed that causes some problems

5442844 students need them if they want to get a job somewhere
5442845 no one does laundry as often as they think they will and you just cant run out of the essentials
5442846 a college or university only insures the building not a students personal belongings such as clothes books and electronics so they should be sure they have insurance to cover such things
5442847 students usually bring everything they own and find that once they get here that they do not have enough space for it all
5442848 a student may know more than the average incoming student about the campus but they still wont know it all as policies activities and living arrangements change yearly so be patient ask questions and listen
5442849 freshmen need to understand that the collegiate experience is a wonderful time to meet and interact with people who are different than they are it may be the first time they are asked to communicate their opinion wants and needs to someone else in a constructive way
5442850 being open to new and different ideas can be a little scary at first but the benefit of listening to another perspective will be invaluable in a students development
5442851 this discovery may eventually lead to enhanced understanding of psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia obsessive compulsive disorder and attention deficit disorder all conditions in which a persons ability to remember and change such rules is impaired
5442852 this indicates that different parts of our brains store different kinds of memories and information
5442853 provides clues about how the human brain accomplishes complex goal directed behaviors that require remembering and changing abstract rules an ability that is disrupted in many mental illnesses

5442855 it will make it such a heightened experience for the audience and for us to cast a real life soldier a veteran and bring him into our created drama

5442860 we have two more weeks until the end of the transfer window and i think this will be the most important week i read alex fergusons statement that he wants another striker and i hope that this striker is dimitar berbatov
5442861 michael has an ankle injury and it has swollen up very badly and hell be out for maybe two or three weeks which is unfortunate
5442862 we worked hard every day but the result was as you see and its really hard to take
5442863 i guess its a lucky number for me now too
5442864 seeing eight in 08 and opening ceremonies starting at 8 08 i guess it was meant to be
5442865 oh man i feel i can just taste it now
5442866 we really thought we had a good chance to have at least one guy in that final
5442867 outflows of foreign currency from russia were 6 billion on friday aug 8 and 1 billion on monday aug 11
5442868 i freaked out and found four different jobs in addition to college studies
5442869 my husband at the time worked as a system administrator in a newspaper and they paid him in computer monitors rather than cash he had five of them in the apartment for a while and managed to only sell three of them in the end
5442870 we joked that the key to a happy marriage is seeing your spouse only twice a week
5442871 after the default we felt insecurity in everything that nothing would get better
5442872 my salary fell right away since i worked at a financial company
5442873 i was never one of those people who dreamed of going abroad things just coincided
5442874 people whose incomes rose in the past few years prefer to spend rather than focus on savings
5442875 since 2001 when we first asked this question the average time people plan ahead is only two years
5442876 this is how far ahead russians think in terms of their careers family planning education and investment
5442877 other firms were laying people off and moving house and we didnt have a large infrastructure so we offered lower prices at the time when most companies cut their pr and marketing budgets
5442878 it formed our working style and taught us to count our money
5442879 im always ready for it to happen again and i think i know what to do when it does
5442880 i dont want anything from anybody i have no interest i leave my future in the hands of the nation and people
5442881 i dont want to be the vice president i am not going to be the nominee
5442882 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states
5442883 if youre unwilling or unable to do that then i think you should defer to someone else
5442884 if norilsk nickels board takes the decision to include all the copper mines that they have on their books then we would be ready to consider a potential partnership
5442885 hopefully alfa will some time come to their senses and discover its just ludicrous and doesnt take them anywhere they just look stupid now i think in most peoples eyes in trying to do this
5442886 if we had bought it in 2005 vimpelcom would now be ukraines third largest operator with a significant market share and worth much more
5442887 it certainly does serve to remind foreign investors that russia remains a difficult place to do business and partnerships with russian investors have to be treated with more care than partnerships with other investors
5442888 the main challenge for the whole financial system of the country is the pension fund deficit we should admit that todays pensions are not sufficient
5442889 we will have to raise taxes we are now at the threshold at which higher pensions will require higher budget spending
5442890 the rumors may be connected with the activities of the onexim division dealing with luxury real estate

5442895 let me repeat liu xiang will not withdraw unless the pain is unbearable
5442896 after liu xiangs injury i wont bother coming back to the birds nest for more
5442897 we feel like were playing very well right now but you have to keep in mind its single elimination

5442904 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5442905 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5442906 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5442907 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5442908 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5442909 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5442910 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5442911 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5442912 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5442913 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5442914 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally

5442928 there are some awfully anal retentive laws against torturing people so ill just have to wear a mask to make it harder to track me down
5442929 the end justifies the means and that man deserves to die so anything i do to cleanse the world of his presence is fair game
5442930 what good is it having all this power unless you can exercise it to the fullest possible extent to reshape the world around you
5442931 it wasnt my fault your honor ever since the unfortunate acid bath ruined my complexion and twisted my sense of humor i just havent been myself
5442932 obviously its my destiny to reshape the world the way it ought to be and if a few people or a few thousand people or a few million people have to die along the way to a new world order then so be it you cant make an omelet without breaking a few eggs
5442933 a fanatic is a man who does what he thinks the lord would do if only he knew the facts of the case

5442935 well i suppose this l guy is entitled to his own silly opinions sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me

5442943 how could i be an agent of interpol or the cia or any of those other agencies when ive already killed so many important people in so many different lands you dont really think any of those stuffy western bureaucracies would take such horrible risks do you
5442944 i couldnt help myself my thinking had been twisted inside out by the real villain and i thought i was doing the right thing
5442945 oh yeah another chance to hack and slash and dodge bullets and leap from rooftops and outwit security systems and outrun cops and prove im the roughest and toughest operator in the business if i couldnt do this three times a week i think id blow my brains out from sheer boredom
5442946 ill do this by the book the way my parents taught me

5442959 they spend a couple hours each week on the project the kids are learning leadership skills
5442960 we decided to exist to equip kids to think live and bring about change in a culture that says kids are going backward not forward
5442961 in doing my masters thesis i found that what makes a difference in a kids life is an adult whos truly involved we are deeply involved in their lives in discipling and mentoring them
5442962 we wanted to form a school where kate would both know others and be known in deeper life changing ways and be challenged in every part of her life
5442963 three teachers with 12 kids is a great ratio its challenging academically but also personally and spiritually its not for every kid
5442964 were preparing them for college in intense ways and theres also a decidedly spiritual component its the education you dream about for your kid a partnering of school with the home
5442965 they taught the kids how to fundraise how to write a fundraising letter how to make a call how to run an event make a budget and develop a profit and loss statement
5442966 they were an energetic group very focused on what they were doing
5442967 we had a conversation with nancy parsons and rosemary moore and talked about how the project would fit the needs of the council we came up with the baby bag project it was a wonderful experience for the council and the kids from veritas they got an up close look at the workings of a nonprofit
5442968 its wonderful for the council to have an opportunity to expose future leaders to community service and citizenship
5442969 it teaches them as kids to support those kinds of community activities
5442970 the tuition is 4 200 per year but well work with parents and kids if they cant afford that
5442971 builders are anticipating the stimulative effects of this legislation and are optimistic that the tax credit will give those buyers whove been sitting on the fence the reason they need to jump back into the market
5442972 america is being overrun by an invasion force from mexico
5442973 i believe that the events in georgia caused the government finally to understand that black is black and white is white
5442974 against the allies of countries that have nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
5442975 we have made another important step to increase polands security
5442976 and it is the russians who convince us how important it is as our sad experience teaches us the louder they protest against something we want to do the more certain it is that it lies in our best interest
5442977 you may fulfill your dream about hegemony in caucasus but youd better bid farewell to another dream about having central europe hanging in a strategic vacuum we cannot effectively stop you in georgia but central europe has been and will be a part of the west
5442978 we would start with a battery under u s command but made available to the polish army then there would be a second phase involving equipping the polish army with missiles

5442982 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
5442983 were pleased with the outcome of the 2008 usa wakeboard nationals
5442984 elizabethtown proved to be an impressive venue for the event as well
5442985 die ganz gro en spr nge wird es nicht mehr geben
5442986 und das ist ja nicht schlecht es gibt nicht viele industrien die das schaffen
5442987 investors react to higher risk very simply they withdraw their money
5442988 all the buildings will undergo renovation some will become residential areas while the rest will be commercial premises
5442989 no discussion of total demolition or clearing out the area ever took place it was out of the question the approach is typical of european companies that preserve historical buildings to adjust them to new functions
5442990 we are keeping in mind that the place was previously adjusted to manufacture tools and weapons and is now going to accommodate tenants so the focus has been on creating housing that meets modern standards here
5442991 the petrovsky arsenal project to convert an underutilized industrial territory into a new modern center for sestroretsk is unique since the redevelopment focuses on the creation of residential areas and not only on business centers the investor has to reconstruct and preserve the industrial buildings to make comfortable and modern housing
5442992 the construction or repair works are expected to be completed within 10 days maximum
5442993 in isolation none of these events are surprising nor do any of them have a material effect on the investment case for russia
5442994 but collectively they add further pressure onto an already deteriorating investment case and make the decision to stay away from the market until the dust settles that much easier
5442995 investors should buy even in the likelihood of u s imposing sanctions economic or financial on russia
5442996 the u s cannot do much to directly affect the russian economy or the earnings of russian companies
5442997 once many funds are underweight it will be possible for investors to ramp up their interest again in the country and deploy funds back to a very cheap russian market
5442998 we are also looking for further tightening of the credit default swap spreads to pre conflict levels
5442999 im more or less telling people what i think theyd be best off thinking
5443000 now i think that with this franchise if atari wants to do something further it has to be a major step towards other things perhaps other platforms other game systems other gameplay
5443001 move away from what has become the classical survival horror game with

5443016 the younger kids are focusing more on their planning and problem solving while they are actually playing the game while adolescents are focusing less on their planning and strategizing and more on the here and now
5443017 the single best predictor of their skills is how much they had played video games in the past and how much they played now those were better predictors of surgical skills than years of training and number of surgeries performed
5443018 so the first question you might ask your surgeon is how many of these surgeries have you done and the second question is are you a gamer

5443020 we believe that respect for the democratic and constitutional processes in that country is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism
5443021 one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5443022 the war against extremism is bigger than any one person whats important here is that we work with pakistan to do what we can to root out these extremists
5443023 if it rolled in after aug 6 it needs to roll out
5443024 obviously if anyone thinks he can kill our citizens our soldiers and officers who are serving as peacekeepers and go unpunished we will never allow this
5443025 anyone who tries this will receive a devastating response for this we have all the means economic and political and military if anyone had illusions about this some time ago then they must part with those illusions now

5443030 there were offers from people as far away as kuwait and from the health ministry but nothing yet
5443031 the perception of jobs that he designs products in the middle of the night and builds them during the day has served apple well
5443032 people look at steve jobs in a lot of different ways being a good ceo being a good innovator being the messiah most of those perceptions are hard to shake
5443033 this is about one person giving a focused message and he delivers it very well
5443034 there are very few people that can deliver a message like steve other ceos only wish they had a fraction of the charisma that steve has
5443035 apple gets appointed as some kind of a poster child for that
5443036 but its not that far off from the normal culture
5443037 its a cultural style issue thats been in apples dna almost from the companys beginning
5443038 in almost every case even with john sculley michael spindler gil amelio apple ceos emerge as the company face and the public image
5443039 apples an 18 billion company it didnt get there because of one man
5443040 whoever leads the company is going to have to be part of the apple culture you cant come in and learn it
5443041 to that degree steves doing a great job of building that cultural acclimation into his leadership staff if wall street truly understood that the company is driven by both vision and execution any impact from a future jobs departure will be minimized
5443042 voice based gps is slow to come to iphone 3g

5443140 sinti en su boca el suave olor de la fiebre y lo aspiro como si quisiera llenarse de las intimidades de su cuerpo y en ese momento se imagin que ya llevaba muchos a os en su casa y que se estaba muriendo de pronto tuvo la clara sensaci n que no podr a sobrevivir a la muerte de ella se acostar a a su lado y querr a morir con ella conmovido por esa imagen hundi en ese momento la cara en la almohada junto a la cabeza de ella y permaneci as durante mucho tiempo y le dio pena que en una situaci n como aquella en la que un hombre de verdad ser a capaz de tomar inmediatamente una decisi n l dudase privando as de su significado al momento mas hermoso que hab a vivido jam s estaba arrodillado junto a su cama y pensaba que no podr a sobrevivir a su muerte se enfad consigo mismo pero luego se le ocurri que en realidad era bastante natural que no supiera que quer a el hombre nunca puede saber que debe querer porque vive solo una vida y no tiene modo de compararla con sus vidas precedentes ni de enmendarla en sus vidas posteriores no existe posibilidad alguna de comprobar cual de las decisiones es la mejor porque no existe comparaci n alguna el hombre lo vive todo a la primera y sin preparaci n como si un actor representase su obra sin ning n tipo de ensayo pero que valor puede tener la vida si el primer ensayo para vivir es ya la vida misma por eso la vida parece un boceto pero ni un boceto es la palabra precisa porque un boceto es siempre un borrador de algo la preparaci n para un cuadro mientras que el boceto que es nuestra vida es un boceto para nada un borrador sin cuadro si cada uno de los instantes de nuestra vida se va a repetir infinitas veces estamos clavados a la eternidad como jesucristo a la cruz la imagen es terrible en el mundo del eterno retorno descansa sobre cada gesto el peso de una insoportable responsabilidad ese es el motivo por el cual nietzsche llam a la idea del eterno retorno la carga m s pesada pero si el eterno retorno es la carga m s pesada entonces nuestras vidas pueden aparecer sobre ese tel n de fondo en toda su maravillosa levedad la carga m s pesada nos destroza somos derribados por ella nos aplasta contra la tierra pero en la poes a amatoria de todas las pocas la mujer desea cargar con el peso del cuerpo del hombre la carga m s pesada es por lo tanto a la vez la imagen de la m s intensa plenitud de la vida cuanto m s pesada sea la carga m s a ras de tierra estar nuestra vida m s real y verdadera ser por el contrario la ausencia absoluta de carga hace que el hombre se vuelva m s ligero que el aire vuele hacia lo alto se distancie de la tierra de su ser terreno que sea real s lo a medias y sus movimientos sean tan libres como insignificantes

5443143 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy to use its military capability to damage and in some cases destroy georgian infrastructure and to try and weaken the georgian state
5443144 we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the trans atlantic structures
5443145 to clearly indicate that we are not accepting a new line
5443146 is a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5443147 this is not something that is just cost free nobody needs russian strategic aviation along americas coast
5443148 an explanation from the russians for why the russian president either wont or cant keep his word
5443149 it didnt take that long for the russian forces to get in and it really shouldnt take that long for them to get out
5443150 anything such as that or any other military equipment that was moved in would be in violation of the cease fire and should be removed immediately
5443151 we hope that tomorrows decisions by nato will be balanced and that responsible forces in the west will give up the total cynicism that has been so evident which is pushing us back to the cold war era
5443152 we dont want to destroy the nato russia council but russias actions have called into question the premise of the nato russia relationship
5443153 the military will continue to fight and the political government will continue to negotiate the negotiations have to continue as it is now an issue of saving pakistani society from the hands of the taliban
5443154 it has very fragile public support it doesnt want to lose that public support by going hard after the militants but at the same time it knows it must do so
5443155 this is a positive change but it is just the beginning
5443156 if the government ends these policies the taliban will stop their activities immediately

5443160 all the markets are going through a positive moment we are betting strongly on mexico this year and we also see opportunities in colombia and chile
5443161 regarding the markets that suffered a bit with bureaucracy last year such as venezuela we are optimistic about the governmental social projects which are in line with suns open source strategy
5443162 because of the federal governments austerity decree the sales cycle for any project has necessarily been extended in mexico but we compensated that with increased business with large and mid size banks

5443173 initially we had a very difficult time convincing television people to take a chance on it
5443174 the conventional wisdom was that was that audiences find tv compelling when the kids are struggling with drinking drugs and promiscuity instead of getting good grades staying out of trouble and going to church every sunday

5443179 deze samenwerking geeft ons de mogelijkheid om onze productie zeer snel op te schroeven en om onze klanten in de verenigde staten korea en het midden oosten voortaan rechtstreeks te bedienen
5443180 i have a tremendous amount of respect for how they handled that
5443181 i can tell you after talking to marian it made him feel really good the way they shared everything with him about the team and the future i thought it was a smart move on their behalf it was a very beneficial thing they did
5443182 you cannot feast while others starve you cannot be happy while others are sad you cannot be fully at ease while millions suffer and as long as millions of people are in poverty our whole society is impoverished
5443183 learning pool will be helping us make this leap to knowledge management so that we can release the expertise that already exists in the workforce and build upon new expertise
5443184 learning pool has developed enormously since 2001 particularly in the last two years without the dedication and support that learning pool provides i would have struggled to develop people solutions a ten minute call to ben or indeed any of the lp staff in the customer service team saves me a lot of work my problems is worked out almost immediately learning pool has provided me with a better understanding of using ict for learning and has opened up many networking opportunities with other councils who are all in similar situations they take a great interest in building partnerships and they encourage us to build networks all at a fair price with learning pool you get value for money

5443204 ich wollte heute abend unbedingt den weltrekord holen und bin so happy dass es geklappt hat
5443205 it was the business side of it i really didnt want to do it because i love football and running around
5443206 it was really no big deal it gave me extended time to further prepare myself for the season
5443207 but he was competing and fighting hell probably be a little sore tomorrow but hes in good shape
5443208 i cant worry about it now i havent lost faith in them i still think they want me here thats all ive got to go on
5443209 weve had time in the past i think were all going on six years together now reading body language coming out of routes is big for me and i think seeing them run those routes for six years has spoken for itself
5443210 it came out and went right back in on the field
5443211 with the position he plays it shouldnt be an issue as it would with some positions
5443212 you normally dont game plan until the third game if theres one position ive got to hang my hat on its our offensive line im more than confident that theres nobody more capable than those guys to keep me clean
5443213 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5443214 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5443215 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5443216 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5443217 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5443218 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5443219 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5443220 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5443221 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5443222 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5443223 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5443224 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5443225 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5443226 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5443227 a equipe est muito bem no dia de hoje est no local no qual queria estar
5443228 a competi o come ou com algumas nuvens mas a pr pria equipe se encarregou de sair para o sol
5443229 no primeiro dia se via tudo escuro por causa da dureza dos rivais mas a argentina fez o que devia para vencer cada partida que lhe restava
5443230 a argentina respeita todos todos os rivais nos respeitam portanto amanh temos que marcar o ritmo desde o in cio estes jogos s s o decididos jogando um bom futebol como fizemos at agora

5443235 joguei contra o cruzeiro e antes fiquei um m s parado mancini j tinha falado que eu estava negociado surgiu uma proposta do atl tico pr e eu n o fui mais relacionado para os jogos agora surgiu o santos e deu tudo certo
5443236 claro que a gente fica chateado desde que cheguei ao palmeiras no in cio do ano participei de quase todos os jogos e praticamente n o tive les es sei que isso acontece e vou trabalhar bastante para retornar o quanto antes
5443237 temos uma semana para o fortalecimento de todos o que n o podemos criar mais problemas agora o que mais tem nesse mundo perdedor o diferente vencer

5443255 no illusions about how hard this is going to be
5443256 you are not going to wave a magic wand to make special interests disappear
5443257 there is a catharsis i mean everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good
5443258 you are a loser a failure youre washed up never to recover always to be known as one who didnt measure up to the call
5443259 god how long do i have to stay in this valley before you do something
5443260 god how should i conduct myself while you are working on this thing
5443261 he shall deliver thee in six troubles yea in seven there shall no evil touch thee
5443262 thou hast caused men to ride over our heads we went through the fire and through the water but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place
5443263 saya sebenarnya malas nak komen banyak sebab orang melayu suka persoalkan perkara yang kadang kadang mereka sendiri tidak tahu
5443264 yang penting saya saksikan sendiri lafaz sumpah itu dan ia menepati syariat islam mana mana pihak yang ragu ragu saya malas nak komen mungkin mereka lebih pandai
5443265 sebenarnya proses bermubahalah telah berlaku apabila mohd saiful melafazkan sumpah laknat tetapi ia belum sempurna kerana pihak satu lagi anwar belum bersumpah
5443266 bagaimanapun dalam melakukan sumpah laknat tidak boleh ada paksaan terhadap mana mana pihak untuk melakukannya kerana ia bergantung kepada individu terbabit
5443267 untuk membawa empat orang saksi bagi membuktikan bahawa beliau telah diliwat oleh datuk seri anwar ibrahim adalah sukar untuk dilakukan jadi dalam islam beliau boleh mengambil langkah ini bersumpah dengan nama allah untuk mempertahankan diri
5443268 sama ada ia adalah gimik politik atau tidak datuk seri anwar tidak seharusnya merasa takut untuk mengangkat sumpah jika beliau tidak bersalah
5443269 wajarlah umat islam menilai langkah yang diambilnya itu kerana dalam sistem kita mana mana individu yang dituduh boleh membersihkan diri atau maruah sama ada dengan cara islam atau cara mahkamah dan saiful memilih cara islam tetapi kuasa untuk menentukan kebenaran masih lagi di bawah bidang kuasa mahkamah
5443270 tidak masuk akal untuk mengatakan akta ini diwujudkan kerana kes tersebut
5443271 adalah penting dna seseorang yang didakwa di mahkamah atau ditahan atas kesalahan tertentu direkodkan
5443272 akta itu nanti akan meliputi pengambilan dna daripada semua tertuduh atau suspek bagi semua jenis jenayah dalam kanun keseksaan
5443273 apa yang kita lakukan ini adalah untuk memperkenalkan undang undang bagi tujuan itu saya tidak tahu kenapa ada pihak yang berkata ada motif tertentu untuk kita mewujudkan akta ini
5443274 jika ada kes mahkamah dan orang itu tidak bersalah kenapa kita perlu risau tentang akta ini

5443278 masyarakat bengkulu tidak dapat membalas jasa baik rakyat malaysia dan kami hanya mampu mendoakan agar tuhan mencatat segala kebaikan yang diberikan
5443279 sudah menjadi tanggungjawab akhbar utusan malaysia untuk membantu masyarakat di negara ini apatah lagi kita adalah daripada rumpun bangsa yang sama

5443286 the olympics by itself is an embodiment of a sort of chinese coming out party
5443287 the chinese are looking at the olympic games as the kind of washing off of all humiliation and bad things that china used to represent
5443288 chinese canadians still hold dear the fact that they are chinese when china becomes a super nation they feel proud they feel that their status in society is tied directly to how china is being thought of on the world stage
5443289 we did everything possible i saw personally how pained liu xiang was
5443290 until he went to the call room he was determined to compete
5443291 i just talked with liu xiang he is very depressed he said he would not drop out of the competition unless it was absolutely necessary unless the pain was intolerable and he had no other way out
5443292 he can barely walk he was in tears and he is very depressed
5443293 no matter what they did they could not help him standing up because once he stood up there was pressure on the heel
5443294 no matter where he goes he sees his own picture in the streets and on the internet its all great pressure
5443295 hes a great athlete unique that he can psychologically stand pressure that no other athlete can stand

5443301 it was really neat to see some of the turtles with the epoxy transmitters on them because it makes it easier to come up with better ideas in the future

5443312 the majority race is not as good at identifying minorities as it is its own race this is hard wired in some way that we dont completely understand but the phenomenon should be presented to the jury
5443313 but is there a rampant problem to the degree that we need to get judges to start telling juries this is the law no
5443314 when women are pregnant theres no selection pressure evolutionarily speaking for having a preference for genetically dissimilar odors
5443315 and if there is any pressure at all it would be towards relatives who would be more genetically similar because the relatives would help those individuals rear the baby

5443334 you cant read all these books in a lifetime now get them delivered to you in an easy to read form and finish them in just a year
5443335 planning on slowly withering away under the weight of incompetent management
5443336 we plan on being around for at least another year or more using up investor money and ensuring that any good ideas coming from our promotion team are completely mangled and destroyed by our board of directors
5443337 this is a big company and it needs help coordinating itself why just this week elitexc had set up an event to air on showtime in september which we told them to go ahead with then the board decided over lunch at the moza that this was a bad idea so we told them to cancel the show i think this shows everyone that were serious about meddling in every aspect of the business for no reason other than to justify our paychecks
5443338 it wont be the first or last company i downsize practically out of existence
5443339 in fact were spending all that money we were gonna waste on that september show bringing in a consulting firm to help fire even more people the guy running this firm used to be a harvard business school teacher who better to tell us how to run a maxed martial arts business

5443345 the advertising campaign concept was based on the fact that the actor has russian roots
5443346 we invoke the father of our nations spirit and call on them to apologise for the legacy of hatred they left us in the form of section 377 said manvendra singh gohil the prince of rajpipla who issued a statement on behalf of the groups at one of the most well attended gay pride parades that the city has seen
5443347 the idea of treating homosexuals as criminals was imposed on the more tolerant traditions of india and the union government must abandon this abhorrent alien legacy of the raj he added
5443348 the russian forces had to operate in an environment of technical inferiority
5443349 given the posture of russian troops how could intelligence analysts have missed the possibility that the russians had laid a trap hoping for a georgian invasion to justify its own counterattack
5443350 the failure to quickly suppress the georgian air defense despite its rather rudimentary capabilities or to achieve air supremacy despite a lack of fighter planes on the georgian side shows the poor condition of the russian air force
5443351 one general lesson that the russian side should learn is that it is possible to build a capable well trained force in just three to four years as saakashvili did
5443352 we have incurred serious losses including to the air force and have taken into account whats happened and will continue to do so
5443353 the main lesson that russia should draw from this conflict is that we need to urgently upgrade our air force with a comprehensive general reform to follow

5443365 america is being overrun by an invasion force from mexico
5443366 we are seeing evidence of ss 21 missiles in south ossetia
5443367 but let me be clear if it rolled in after august 6th it needs to roll out
5443368 that would be in keeping with the russian commitment on withdrawal
5443369 anything such as that or any other military equipment that was moved in would be in violation of the ceasefire and should be removed immediately
5443370 the only forces that are permitted to remain under the ceasefire agreement are the forces that were in there at the august 6th timeframe
5443371 were seeing them solidify their positions in south ossetia and abkhazia
5443372 i cant say whether they are actually moving people out right now or not but we do expect them to start moving out we expect them to move out slowly so this may take some time
5443373 when we received news of the first two ss 21 russian missile launchers into georgian territory
5443374 we have to move away from this total ban and find ways for people to let off steam a little bit more but safely
5443375 weve got to allow political videos but with some safeguards

5443378 it was very surprising that these subjects would still have cells floating in their blood so long afterward
5443379 the antibodies that we isolated are remarkable antibodies they grab onto the virus very tightly and they virtually never fall off
5443380 that allows them to kill the 1918 virus with extreme potency meaning it takes a very small amount of antibody
5443381 the thought is the first influenza that you see during life is the one that you have the best immunity to
5443382 if we can learn the rules about how these antibodies work we may be able to design antibodies to lots of other viruses
5443383 this study tells us that human beings can make long lasting immune responses to bird influenza

5443403 esta afecci n act a sobre la voluntad y el raciocino del jugador altera su percepci n de la realidad y su escala de valores
5443404 hay que tener en cuenta varios elementos pero los s ntomas caracter sticos de un jugador est n relacionados con un deterioro en las relaciones familiares y laborales ya que comienzan a detectarse movimientos patrimoniales confusos que alteran su econom a del jugador
5443405 la ludopat a es una adicci n y dentro de stas de comportamiento mas all de estos elementos que son susceptibles para diagnosticar hay que tener en cuenta la personalidad del jugador en general es una persona con baja tolerancia a la frustraci n intolerante ego sta que tiene baja autoestima y una fuerte carencia en las primeras relaciones objetales con la madre que lo lleva a compensar con el juego a partir de all entra en un circulo vicioso porque el juego opera como un refuerzo intermitente de la conducta
5443406 es jugar sin tener control de si mismo la persona no puede controlar el impulso y aunque pierda sigue apostando necesita jugar no hay un l mite porque no mide las consecuencias y en ese caso la adicci n se torna da ina ya que el juego produce un deterioro muy grande de las relaciones familiares
5443407 es raro que el jugador pida ayuda por lo general es el familiar el que pide ayuda primero y toma la iniciativa pero a veces no alcanza ya que en el enfermo debe darse un proceso
5443408 por lo general no hay un reconocimiento de la conducta es una patolog a una enfermedad cr nica y siempre est la posibilidad de la reca da por lo que cuando se inicia el tratamiento es necesario explicar esta circunstancia
5443409 hay que cambiar los pensamientos que tiene ya que eso se refleja en sus emociones y le puede provocar un cambio de actitud es importante tambi n trabajar sobre las relaciones familiares y siempre se aconsejan los grupos de autoayuda la tr ada es grupos de autoayuda psicoterapia individual y relaciones familiares eso es un tratamiento m nimo para ayudar a un jugador
5443410 este grupo de profesionales se re ne con los empleados de las salas de juego para determinar la existencia o no de personas que juegan compulsivamente una vez que los detectan tratan de llegar a ellos para ofrecerles asesoramiento en la materia y lograr que accedan tratarse pero fundamentalmente se contactan con el grupo familiar
5443411 el jugador compulsivo es reacio a hacerse atender nunca reconoce que est enfermo dice que es la manera que tiene de jugar es decir siempre busca una excusa para no quedar excluido y seguir haciendo lo que le gusta que es jugar
5443412 dentro de esa tem tica hay gente que pide ser excluida de las salas de juego llenan un formulario para que no se los deje entrar pero en realidad son los menos
5443413 muchos se han disfrazado para ingresar porque se arrepienten de su propia decisi n
5443414 casi nadie admite que est enfermo y por lo tanto tampoco se someten al tratamiento para la cura el jugador por si mismo es dif cil que reconozca la adicci n y muchos llegan solo porque el grupo familiar los trae en el gabinete los profesionales efect an terapias para recuperarlos tratan de persuadirlos para que dejen de jugar pero si no se puede los derivan a centros especializados

5443418 a woman had called 911 complaining her fianc had been drinking and
5443419 she stated that she had overreacted and that she would do anything
5443420 the only other witness the prosecution had was a policeman who had heard the womans original complaint part of his testimony was contradicted by facts that could be ascertained from the 911 recording in the jury room some of us speculated about why this case had ever been brought to court

5443442 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy to use its military capability to damage and in some cases destroy georgian infrastructure and to try and weaken the georgian state
5443443 we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the trans atlantic structures
5443444 to clearly indicate that we are not accepting a new line
5443445 is a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider

5443448 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5443449 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5443450 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5443451 pakistans nuclear arsenal is in the hands of the army and the army is not changing hands so whatever the situation was before is largely what it will continue to be
5443452 if pakistan becomes a more fragile and even failing state then the nuclear assets will be everybodys problem internationally the best way to prevent that from happening is in strengthening the new governments ability to govern
5443453 pod tolerance was my word of choice we give what we can there are times for all of us when the well runs dry most of us with

5443475 tv sets that currently receive programming through cable or satellite are not likely to be affected by the transition to digital
5443476 if you are a cable customer you may have to do little or nothing to enjoy your favorite programming after the switch to digital tv dtv your cable provider will take care of the transition for you thats because your cable company already has technology in place to handle dtv it does this by capturing these digital signals and sending them to your home through the same cable connection that delivers popular national channels like espn cnn hbo and hundreds of others as long as your tv sets are connected to cable theyll display local dtv stations along with the many other stations cable has to offer
5443477 cable subscribers may need new dtv equipment to view dtv programming in digital format you should ask your cable provider what you will need and when
5443478 analog tvs will continue to work with cable satellite vcrs dvd players camcorders video games consoles and other devices for many years
5443479 as i said if you subscribe to a pay tv service such as dish directv or cableproviders like comcast your television will continue to work regardless of whether it is analog or digital

5443538 to suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances for admitting different amounts of light and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration could have been formed by natural selection seems i freely confess absurd in the highest degree
5443539 yet reason tells me that if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one very imperfect and simple each grade being useful to its possessor can be shown to exist if further the eye does vary ever so slightly and the variations be inherited which is certainly the case and if any variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal under changing conditions of life then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection though insuperable by our imagination can hardly be considered real how a nerve comes to be sensitive to light hardly concerns us more than how life itself first originated but i may remark that several facts make me suspect that any sensitive nerve may be rendered sensitive to light and likewise to those coarser vibrations of the air which produce sound

5443592 i am happy to say that i have fully recovered from the breathing difficulties from the surgery but i am sad to say that i will no longer play for fenerbahce
5443593 i am leaving fenerbahce because of the despicable treatment i received from the management during my months out of action but i am sad for the fans because of their fantastic support they gave me during this trying time
5443594 i got injured while playing for this club delayed my surgery just to help the club win the title the clubs doctors messed up the operation and now management are stabbing me in the back
5443595 the management have made it impossible to stay so i am looking ahead to new challenges
5443596 i travelled to italy in the company of the vice president of the club mr murat ozaydinli to receive treatment
5443597 while i was in italy with mr ozaydinli the invitation came from my country to support and he duly approved my travel to ghana for the nations cup
5443598 i think they were angry because i turned down the request to freeze my licence but they did not explained the consequences and also i thought it was unethical and insensitive to make that request while i was confident of returning

5443610 how about you say his name and say hey this guy was mvp of the euro league and he runs that pick and roll and hes one of the great players in euro history jesus theodoros popaloukas took him apart like a surgeon and you dont even know his name
5443611 he didnt know the name of a single greek player

5443615 colangelo has been the key to me but none of this happens without kobe bryant and lebron james setting the tone here
5443616 im doing the game on tv for euro sport here and i hear someone is saying that they shouldve put amare stoudemire on this team instead of tayshaun prince i mean are you crazy you want a prima donna instead of a team guy like prince who only cares about winning i mean just shut up you are out of your mind colangelo got it right here were seeing that now
5443617 with what weve seen here theyve overcompensated to a point where you cant help but admire the way theyre presenting themselves especially the superstar players
5443618 its impressive just how friendly and open theyve been to the competitors this american team has made itself a part of the competitions with the other sports getting out and seeing different things
5443619 i think the two and three year programs we have now has done a lot for the way we pull for each other the way you see guys cheering each other
5443620 we arent showing people up theres no celebrating on the court were going to do this all the right way
5443621 what was it that the japanese officer said after pearl harbor
5443622 i think we just awoke the sleeping giant well thats what europe has done with the united states and now theyre all about to go under afoot of the u s again
5443623 i had a far throw nobody stepped up so i have the gold medal
5443624 i had a mary lou retton leotard that i wore all the time
5443625 and i grew out of it quite quickly i was 6 foot by the time i was in junior high
5443626 weve had time in the past i think were all going on six years together now reading body language coming out of routes is big for me and i think seeing them run those routes for six years has spoken for itself
5443627 it came out and went right back in on the field
5443628 with the position he plays it shouldnt be an issue as it would with some positions
5443629 hes so big and so global now im sure well try to top it
5443630 we had hoped to have it end at johnny unitas stadium but that may not cut it

5443632 it is kind of crazy it is all happening like this but to be the best you have to beat the best
5443633 we have not had the easiest road but every game we have gotten better
5443634 brazil is a great side and we have to be ready to play or we will get beat in the final you have to play better and that is our goal
5443635 and maybe more importantly we have been through a lot to get to the final that could be important
5443636 the fox knows many things but the hedgehog knows one big thing

5443640 can he get the title for liverpool as ronaldo did last season why not they are different players ronaldo comes in from the side but fernando is a real striker he has everything to be the best player this season
5443641 there was nothing on when he got the ball versus sunderland but he scores a few goals like that he is always looking for the target and as soon as he gets space to shoot he shoots and often scores
5443642 he is a megastar now he played wonderfully at the euros and always when you need him he scores very important goals he is a top quality player and for me he is the best striker in the world if you are speaking about a real striker he is the pinnacle he is everything not only in normal games but more often than not in special games
5443643 as a dutchman i grew up watching van basten and gullit and they were the best players and he is as good as them
5443644 i would like to write down what happened in my grandmothers house the summer i was eight or nine but i am not sure if it really happened

5443651 through reading the bible i was learning more and more about gods design for marriage according to divine design marriage is a covenant not a contract a contract can be broken but a covenant is forever when marriage is just a contract you will focus on your rights when it is a covenant you look for loopholes when you realize its a covenant you learn to stay committed for life contracts are written on paper and based on mistrust which explains why you put it in writing a covenant on the other hand is a verbal promise based entirely on faith and commitment

5443670 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
5443671 absolutely clearly demonstrates what we had said earlier the deployment has the russian federation as its target
5443672 it is sad news for all who live on this densely populated continent but it is not dramatic
5443673 poland is an independent country and its an ally of the united states and its a democratic country to whose security the united states is committed

5443693 we already know that depression causes concentration problems and now it appears that people taking antidepressants who also have relatively higher depression scores fare significantly worse when attempting to perform a computerized simulation of driving
5443694 and i wouldnt want to instill fear in drivers but i think that perhaps individuals who are taking these medications should just be aware of the fact that they may cause concentration problems and impair reaction time
5443695 this issue is not just a question for drivers because the cognitive skills needed for driving are also needed for a lot of other skills
5443696 there is already a very deep literature about subtle impairments of higher cognitive function associated with clinical depression itself apart from medications
5443697 i would add that in any case medication package inserts routinely warn patients about a whole host of issues when starting a course of psychotropic drugs including warning against the handling of machinery driving or engaging in any occupation in which you can be injured so to that extent this concern isnt new

5443709 the paintings of samantha keely smith draw heavily on images of the safe place of the supernatural where dreams and visions are made concrete and whole exuding otherworldly power and emotion its strong stuff heady and exhausting as smith is the first to admit the result is a sort of fantastical abstract genre that looks and feels ageless simultaneously very old and new

5443711 i am no music scholar but i feel i know appropriate church music when i hear it last sundays new hymn if you can call it that sounded like a sentimental love ballad one would expect to hear crooned in a saloon if you insist on exposing us to rubbish like this in gods house dont be surprised if many of the faithful look for a new place to worship the hymns we grew up with are all we need

5443758 tiresome refusal to use images to convey information and ideas

5443761 if you put a burrito under your pillow before you go to bed
5443762 its just experience shes been in the olympics before shes been in world championships shes jumped a decade longer than me so its just a matter of time
5443763 i just wanted to prove who is the best at the olympic games
5443764 having my babies i think that was the biggest i mean even while i was still in the hospital i was very much aware in that moment that this is the biggest thing you will ever do this is it for any woman and for me as well
5443765 probably the same thing i mean honestly being entrusted with the lives of two people who are totally dependent on you it was always about me or my husband or whatever but mostly myself my whole life you know but once you have babies its a whole different take and a whole different spin on life youre aware that youre really responsible for raising these children in the right way trying to instill them with values and tools and love and you have to have patience and boundless energy its a relentless thing you know what i mean its not like ok today i want to sleep in nope youre going to get up and youre going to do it again you can always take a day off from work you can always take time from a relationship or family you can take time from anything except raising kids its a challenge for me which is great because i love a challenge
5443766 nonnegotiable is obviously for me the babies come first i want them to travel with me i want them to be with me ill only leave them with my sister or their father or my mom and thats only for a few hours at a time and you know that has to be in place i feel like my family life being a good wife being a good mom having my house in a beautiful way and creating a beautiful life for us is first marc and i have to be a unit to make a unit for our children our house has to be a good home for that thats very very important to me marc knows that then theres my work and i think that all comes second its second because i need to be fulfilled as an individual to be good for everybody else in my life including my children including my husband but even that has changed since i had my kids before being fulfilled as an individual wouldve been so much more about work its not about that as much anymore that paradigm has shifted for me
5443767 yeah i think ive always had a lot of energy
5443768 ok i think i did it i think i did that thing i was after
5443769 gosh i think im most inspired and i hate to sound like a broken record but i have to say by the love i have for my children honestly thats the most inspirational thing anybody who has a child will understand that that i cant stop i thought honestly that i would be more ready to kind of just sit still with the babies when they were born and that is a want and a need that i have but actually it made me more ambitious more inspired to do things if im doing music i think about them hearing it later if im doing a performance theyre going to know that they were alive when i did this performance thats the main motivating force is my family and i have to include marc in that because hes very inspiring as well we push each other to try to do bigger and greater things in our lives and i honestly feel like its the beginning for both of us the real beginning we were able to finally create a real family unit and i think we both tried before but this is something where we actually found a partner who understands us and who really really wants you to be your best and is not afraid of you being your best and i want the same for him we push each other to the greatest heights i hope and thats what i want to do for my whole family thats the inspiration of my life
5443770 thats totally true as human beings we have a tendency to focus on the negative that one negative thing marc and i will always joke about how were dong a concert and theres 25 000 people there and theres one person in the front row whos like straight face and for some reason that person just jumps out everybodys got their hands in the air and that one person can get to you but thats how life is you can have all this wonderful stuff and this one little thing is going wrong and we tend to focus on that its not about that its about being grateful its about seeing all the blessings you have if you have your health and a great family and love in your life if you have those basic basic things you know you can do anything weve just been adding onto that its just pluses
5443771 i think everybodys got a right to run for president who qualifies under the constitution and id be the last person to begrudge anybody their ambition

5443786 in the rainforest exposure to light during the day causes them to switch off but in caves there is no light to cause that to happen however they switch off of their own accord and they do it in synchrony
5443787 the most unexpected result of the study was they are out of sync with their surface relatives they glow most brightly when it is daylight outside the cave
5443788 the more we know about the factors that influence the glow intensity the better off managers of these sites will be in ensuring that the display is as attractive as possible while maintaining the long term health of the glow worm colonies
5443789 our work has the potential to reveal insights into the evolution of bioluminescence and the way biological rhythms can be acted on by natural selection to become optimised for different environments
5443790 if it were true that older kids are able to learn at a faster rate then the differences in test scores should get bigger as kids progress and the material gets more difficult but we really see the opposite
5443791 kids learn at lot before kindergarten especially if theyre in preschool one way to think about it is that the oldest kid in kindergarten has about 20 percent more life experience
5443792 but once they start they basically learn at the same rate
5443793 older kids may do better at first but theres a tradeoff
5443794 theyre also a year in school behind other kids their own age at the end of the line somehow that year will catch up to them they start work a year later and parents have an extra year of child care costs if they delay entry so its not free
5443795 what we think is going on is that teachers are comparing younger kids to older classmates and the younger kids tend to stand out
5443796 they stand out either as not doing as well or they tend to stand out as being more hyperactive
5443797 older kids do better at first and younger kids do worse but they catch up
5443798 the thing is schools are making profound decisions based on these differences differences that tend to fade away
5443799 its clear the pattern is these academic differences get smaller as kids get older
5443800 it doesnt seem reasonable to us that there could be large long term gains from starting kindergarten at an older age when there isnt much of an effect for kids in eighth grade
5443801 whether they go to school earlier or later thats really not going to matter much at the end of the day

5443803 i had been working on infrared reflection spectroscopy for medical imaging when andrew approached me about a possible collaboration i thought that this would be perfect for the frogs it can show us what is happening in the frogs skin but it is non invasive
5443804 this is a great example of novel and exciting interdisciplinary research that draws on expertise right across the university
5443805 with a third of the worlds amphibians currently under threat its vitally important we do our utmost to investigate the reasons why they are dying out at such an alarming rate
5443806 the imaging techniques we use do not harm the frogs in any way as an animal conservationist i simply would not allow any research that distressed these amazing creatures
5443807 the results reveal that although learning the language of science remains a primary hurdle students taught using our content first approach demonstrated an improved conceptual and linguistic understanding of science
5443808 furthermore as we examined each groups differential performance the students were randomly divided into two groups it became clear that students ability to communicate using scientific language was significantly impacted by this treatment
5443809 we knew what an apple was before we said apple
5443810 we were hungry and saw an apple and we were able to say give me that apple need drove language acquisition
5443811 teaching science as a language a content first approach to science teaching
5443812 in contrast to foreign language instruction where students are learning new ways to express familiar ideas science instruction often involves the presentation of new ideas expressed through new language
5443813 in science class students get new words and new ideas simultaneously
5443814 wendy needs the healing powers of a full grown mandrake plant if you can help me grow we can save my friend wendy
5443815 the thing that were most excited about is that the students in the treatment group
5443816 they got higher scores when questions were asked in everyday language they got higher scores when questions were asked in science language and when they were asked to write answers to open ended questions they were much better at writing their ideas in science language
5443817 my response to that is that theres no research to document what happens if you teach in this particular way so how do teachers know it works
5443818 and in the classrooms ive seen teachers are not sophisticated in the way they teach good scientific language consistently
5443819 but putting students in situations where theyre required to use the language which is what we did in this study is absolutely not common

5443821 the south stream project has been strengthened by the current situation and nabucco may fall by the wayside russia has the whip hand over europe in terms of energy policy
5443822 energy from russia seems to reconcile europes regional strategic interests with security of supply at a smaller diplomatic cost but it is only the lesser of two evils
5443823 the greatest threat to western companies in the region is renationalisation in former soviet countries which has already been taking place in russia as a result of this conflict countries neighbouring russia may offer oil and gas contracts to moscow as an olive branch

5443865 when we green light any partners plan there are specific criteria that need to be hit
5443866 there can be no channel conflict there cant be other partners participating in these accounts it doesnt make any sense for a partner to drive business if all theyre doing is taking it from a partner that already has hp revenue we have to manage conflict
5443867 simply no way that hp knows all the leads we have
5443868 youve got to see how this plays out but i cant view this as a positive
5443869 you cant stop a vendor from doing what its going to do
5443870 partner wise all of us battle cdw already we do a lot of state and local government work and are constantly butting heads with them but you have to differentiate yourself on services and support
5443871 this somehow in my book goes against hp ceo mark hurds call for partner loyalty

5443883 because its risky its only appropriate for a tiny fraction of people with obesity the sickest 1 to 2 percent
5443884 the idea that all obese people should get surgery is insane
5443885 we dont actually fully understand how fat works or how it influences health in a direct way and instead of trying to further that understanding were going to recommend you just get the fat removed via a gruesome procedure that will in the best of circumstances affect your ability to eat and digest food for the rest of your life and the long term health consequences of which are largely unknown
5443886 the surgery changes our physiology the way the body responds to food it makes heavy people more like people who are naturally thin
5443887 understanding this as a set point issue allows us to stop blaming the patient who doesnt do as well because they were just built that way what they lose is what they lose and they cant expect to lose any more
5443888 wls makes fat people like thin people except without actually making them thin

5443899 i will ensure that i create more occasions for you to write about me
5443900 true to his word gupta created history by becoming the third indian after viswanathan anand 1987 and p
5443901 i had never heard of gaziantep but after hearing the national anthem twice on independence day i can never forget the place
5443902 i was not expecting to win till the seventh round i played for about six hours against eltaj safarli but i finally broke the deadlock and won after that round i was quite comfortable
5443903 the trouble is in picking him i have not seen any bowler like this he is an unusual bowler the only option right now is to play more and more of him thats the only way of getting better
5443904 even if you pick him by the time you realise what ball it is it gets really late to play a big shot you will see batsmen who can play him but in one day cricket it is not only about playing him you have to rotate the strike because you dont want a bowler to end up with ten overs for 20 runs
5443905 we will need to find a way by which we can rotate the strike if not play big shots
5443906 while mendis walked away with the big wickets muttiah muralitharan introduced as late as the 27th over chipped in with three of his own
5443907 murali and mendis are different bowlers murali can turn the ball on any wicket he loves sri lankan wickets
5443908 even when he bowls fast he gets some purchase out of the wicket no other spinner would have got so much turn
5443909 dhoni also underscored the importance of batsmen getting good starts before mendis and murali came on
5443910 its important to get a good start in the last two games we lost quick wickets when you are playing mendis you have to save wickets and get the runs as well
5443911 it gets a bit tough with time batsmen will get used to it
5443912 dhoni also admitted that he had misread the pitch and perhaps fielding first would have been a better option
5443913 to start with we misread the wicket a bit we did not think it would seam or swing that much
5443914 there was a fair bit in the wicket to start off the sri lankan bowlers bowled really well they got the first two batsmen out it was not like the batsmen played bad shots and got out credit goes to their fast bowlers
5443915 you cant really think about the guys you are missing
5443916 asked if sehwags absence would make a big difference mahela jayawardene said

5443923 we had three russian referees everything else was on the tv screen
5443924 in most fights one gets to know who will win by the second round i am used to fighting an open bout
5443925 but today i even tried provoking him but he was taking no chances
5443926 the third round made the difference going for the jugular akhil started attacking veaceslav
5443927 i have no complaints that the judges have not given akhil points
5443928 if veaceslav had come with a plan he succeeded even without hitting a full blooded punch he managed to beat akhil
5443929 theek hai its okay life goes on i never thought i would box last year i never thought i would make it to the olympics

5443931 his heel achilless tendon in the right foot was troubling him today before the race he hurt his right foot once again
5443932 xiang had this problem even before he entered the games village on august 16 during his run up to the games there were concerns that his hamstring might not allow him to train properly
5443933 we have had three doctors working on him but it did not work
5443934 even though there was pain he exercised to his best so he decided to compete after treatment
5443935 he would have never withdrawn from a race if the pain was not unbearable
5443936 whether xiangs made his comeback under pressure from his home fans feng said
5443937 i felt like i was an actress and all the stadium was just for me
5443938 he would not have withdrawn unless the pain was intolerable

5443953 notwithstanding posturing we do not expect ea to be impressed with the presentation which will include a 3 year release schedule and a list of cost control initiatives we think that most of forward game schedule is fairly evident ea should not be particularly surprised to learn that gta 5 and bioshock 2 are planned and think that its cost control initiatives while impressive will not sway ea to offer more given the latter companys apparent intention to eliminate all take two overhead anyway however we believe that accepting a presentation by take two will allow the companys management to save face and allow them to remain relevant in the negotiations

5443999 the u s department of energy in a report published in may found the total extra cost of providing 20 of u s electricity from wind power in 2030 versus a no new wind scenario to be 43 billion which works out to 50 cents per month for the average utility ratepayer this is because winds capital costs and added transmission costs are largely offset by fuel cost savings
5444000 vestas is the first flag planted in the state for manufacturing in the wind energy sector we hope theyll prove to be something of a bell cow
5444001 i think there are some very strong growth signals in these results stronger than i can ever remember seeing in vestas in particular i want to highlight the order book of e7 2 billion i might have bid e5 5 billion if i had been optimistic
5444002 this expansion reinforces colorados standing as a national and international leader in clean modern energy for the future
5444003 at this point theres nothing standing in our way of continuing to do what we said were going to do
5444004 the program has all of those same things built in
5444005 its an opportunity to change the way we consume energy without significantly changing our lifestyle
5444006 itll have a similar set of visual cues and some of the features that were on the concept car all those things result in lots of other mechanical parts and bits and pieces that have nothing to do with electrical energy so weve had some issues there
5444007 we have a lot of experience with lithium were pretty confident with which chemistries work and which dont work

5444015 as weve always maintained we continue to bring stock into the uk on a weekly basis and wii fits recent performance in the software chart is testament to this continual shipments into the uk will carry on right up to and through the peak season period and we are continuing to look at the current stock situation very closely
5444016 indications so far are that the tour has been very popular and the software very well received it is pleasing to see so many people step up for the first time to video games and thoroughly enjoy the experience whether its a grandmother doing a bit of yoga or an avid gamer getting a sweat on its very positive to see such a variety of people having fun with wii fit

5444040 i know specifically that bravo company im sure and i hope from what i did for them that theyre better off than they would have been if this happened four weeks ago
5444041 what happened was due to the political decision of georgian authorities and not the performance on the ground
5444042 gravely concerned about the alarming increase in the incidence and severity of racially motivated violence especially by young people belonging to
5444043 this finding represents a key extension of other studies on puma because such loss had never been shown before in human cancer
5444044 on the one hand patients receiving traditional chemotherapy can suffer the loss of immune cells and this loss occurs in part because puma induces the death of these cells
5444045 in this case the goal would be to protect patients bone marrow by developing drugs to inhibit puma on the other hand for patients with a lymphoma in which puma was inactivated drugs could be used to reactivate the gene to trigger apoptosis and kill the tumor cells
5444046 even though pneumococcus is very common until recently no one had realized that it could develop this pilus to reach out and touch a human cell
5444047 oral streptococci which are normally in the mouth and throat have the pilus genetic package and we believe pneumococcus picked it up in the back of the throat we decided to look at how the bacterium figures out how to use that package
5444048 when bacteria attack the lung there are two steps they need to do to establish pneumonia
5444049 they need to stick to lung cells and they also need to invade the lung cells our experiments were designed to separately test those two steps and we established that the pili are not used for adhesion but for invasion which was not understood before
5444050 so far only 20 percent or so of the clinically important strains of pneumococci have developed this trick of producing the proteins for making pili
5444051 in creating vaccines we want to use proteins that occur in a wide variety of bacterial strains these pili related proteins are not prime candidates so we can now concentrate on other proteins that we know are expressed almost universally by pneumococci and that we can put into a vaccine
5444052 current vaccines used in the developed world cost over 100 a dose and are limited to protecting against perhaps 10 to 15 types of pneumococci
5444053 but that price is far too high for developing countries and there are 90 types of pneumococci out there
5444054 when we brought steve in we really took a look and at this point he wasnt where we thought we needed to have him so we needed to move on

5444056 pai perdoa lhes porque n o sabem o que fazem
5444057 pero las soluciones para el campo brillan por su ausencia
5444058 el gobierno tiene otros problemas graves por ah le podemos servir como una cortina de humo por eso les pido que seamos cautelosos y prudentes pero que no por eso no tengamos una firmeza tremenda de nuestros reclamos

5444070 the industry has been spending money to develop better coal technology but making the burning of coal truly clean will require some research support from the government why is this why cant the industry just do it research to develop clean coal technology is expensive and it requires more money than any one company is able to commit
5444071 the idea is based on the third law of thermodynamics which states that the entropy at absolute zero is dependent only on the degeneracy of the ground state this in turn implies that the specific heat capacity of a material must asymptotically approach zero as the temperature gets closer to absolute zero but if particles within the material were entangled vedral and pals say this would not be the case that kind of thinking suggests a straightforward experiment simply measure the heat capacity of a material as its temperature drops to zero if it doesnt asymptotically approach zero then youve got some entanglement on your hands
5444072 why are books on buddhism so popular and not books on christianity
5444073 i think its because buddhism presents itself as a way of life and christianity presents itself as a system of belief i would want to get christian ministers thinking about how to rediscover their own faith as a way of life because thats what people are searching for today thats what they need most
5444074 the babies have actually made me more ambitious i feel all this newfound inspiration
5444075 ive always loved sports i used to be on a track team in school and thats probably why i can think to myself now yeah i can do this which is totally crazy the team was a big part of my life back then and taught me so many things when i look back on my life and what im able to do its partly because of that early training it taught me discipline how to be committed about striving to win stamina all that good stuff
5444076 i dont expect to win this race my goal is to finish ill probably end up crawling across the finish line but ill do it
5444077 hey dude contrary to what you may think i dont sit on this thing all day waiting for suave folx like you to tell me how badly you want to fuck me
5444078 well i did my best i guess finishing 15th is a bit disappointing
5444079 canada as a country is doing a lot to help athletes reach elite levels but its a different question when you ask if the best in canada are the best in the world in some event
5444080 the olympics are one of the few places were national identities get shaped and formed other than war
5444081 if you are one of the g7 g8 or g10 then you hope to be that in the event as well when you fail to reach the podium in so many different sporting events then maybe the worry is we arent the country we thought we were
5444082 its a pretty crappy car crossed with a pretty crappy boat does neither all that good fun though the kids love it
5444083 we are routinely bringing in approximately a quarter million dollars per month
5444084 because locals know enough to evade the cop cams the villages new revenue mostly comes from outsiders rather like a commuter tax

5444086 toch denken we dat dit een mythe is een zwaan die een volwassen arm breekt dat zou nieuws zijn
5444087 ik trek het mij persoonlijk aan dat u de waarde van uw beleggingen zo hebt zien kelderen
5444088 de overgrote meerderheid van aandeelhouders groot en klein en ook van onze klanten is gelukkig en steunt ons
5444089 kunnen wij conclusies aan deze bijeenkomst verbinden kunnen wij ons erop beroepen
5444090 dit soort avonden zullen we op reguliere basis voor u organiseren
5444091 eigenlijk heb ik niet zo veel grote zorgen over dit bedrijf alle financi le fondsen hebben het momenteel zwaar ik dacht dat ik fortis op het dieptepunt kocht op 12 euro als ik een zorg heb gaat die over het geringe vertrouwen dat er bestaat in de financi le sector in het algemeen maar ik denk dat in 2009 en 2010 het vertrouwen weer terugzal keren
5444092 wat gaan ze doen om het geschonden vertrouwen van de aandeelhouders te herstellen
5444093 een speciale aandeelhoudersvergadering zoals door de veb wordt voorgesteld is naar mijn mening overdreven er zijn wel enkele onderdelen uit het tienpuntenplanplan van de veb die volgens mij belangrijk zijn fortis zou bijvoorbeeld de risico en controlesystemen moeten versterken ook zou het bedrijf moeten werken aan de transparantie en die verbeteren zoals is voorgesteld
5444094 ik erger me groen en geel aan de mediahetze die dit bedrijf treft de georkestreerde campagne van de veb beleggersvereniging red heeft de problemen waarin fortis verkeert verergerd het begon met de kritiek op de beloning van bestuursvoorzitter votron vervolgens stapt meneer slagter directeur van de veb red het fortiskantoor binnen met een cameraploeg van het journaal in zijn kielzog en dan komt de beschuldiging van misleiding aan het adres van de raad van bestuur allemaal negatieve kritiek die niet het belang van de aandeelhouders heeft gediend
5444095 wanneer houdt de veb nu eens op met die hetze
5444096 votron moet terugkeren als bestuursvoorzitter hij is een fantastische vent een ziener met amerikaanse doortastendheid alleen hij is in staat om fortis weer uit de problemen te krijgen het is een schande dat hij het veld heeft moeten ruimen
5444097 flink verlies ik heb mn aandelen gekocht voor ruim 24 euro nu staat de koers onder de 10
5444098 de situatie met de kredietcrisis bezorgt alle beleggers veel onzekerheid maar voor de aandeelhouders van dit bedrijf is het extra pijnlijk dat het bestuur anders dan beloofd toch zijn dividendbeleid heeft gewijzigd
5444099 mijn aandelenbelang is te klein om echt boos te zijn maar ik ben erg benieuwd of het management eigenlijk zelf weet of alle leed nu is geschikt de onverwachte kapitaalmaatregelen van eind juni bewijzen dat de raad van bestuur er goed in is zaken te onderschatten
5444100 he is a lanky 92 birthday who works hard and sees the ice well
5444101 i also noticed he finds the open spaces as well as i have seen out here he always seems to find the quiet ice to get a pass and make a play
5444102 not an overly big guy but has tremendous puck skills and is a shifty center
5444103 this kid was unreal i thought he was the best player on the ice for the russians he wasnt really quick but he had great hands and passed through sticks and skates with ease
5444104 good puck mover kept it simple throws his body around as well
5444105 he sees the ice very well and always seemed to make a great first pass while playing a real steady defensive game
5444106 another mid sized shifty center with great puck skills and a knack around the net
5444107 he was really good in the game i watched and in the game against us
5444108 he looks big in the net and gives off very few rebounds making the first save and not giving up much else
5444109 great with the puck and really looked like a smart player who could find the open man
5444110 very aggressive plays in your face hockey and is average sized but likes to get physical here and there
5444111 has a decent skill level and can score smart player and very effective in the offensive end
5444112 the same type of player as cehlin but just not quite as good
5444113 good hands and a good skater and he can score
5444114 hes a big player and uses his body to his advantage
5444115 he has a high skill level and has good on ice vision he doesnt hit too much but isnt scared to get physical
5444116 wenn man einen teil einer sache durchblickt versteht man auch die ganze
5444117 there is one thing we do on earth that we will continue to do in heaven that is to praise and worship god that is why we view life on earth for those who live jesus as choir practise for heaven to say that praise and worship is the most important category of music is an understatement in light of that fact there is no more important activity of the human heart that to praise and worship god
5444118 im getting better im working on me im trying to be a better friend
5444119 um thanks so much for helping me walk down a road at gunpoint in my own country thats awesome of you im from baghdad which youre bombing to the stone age so thanks for that too

5444122 i dont buy the 2 number at all it seems pretty unlikely that im affected as well as all of my friends in 3 different states by something as random as a 2 problem
5444123 we thought we had done the most wonderful thing in the world
5444124 the next year we had a few more people and a few more the year after that and it just kept going
5444125 for pleasure driving it is well known that walnut hill is the place to go
5444126 our emphasis originally was to perpetuate the art and sport of driving for the improvement of the sport
5444127 and for the appreciation of the american public for the contribution made by the horse and carriage to our social cultural political and military history
5444128 weve got two trucks and one trailer and no extra space

5444135 our vision is big but it makes sense this is a real solution with serious players and proven technology
5444136 we didnt know when it would work and were quite surprised at how well it will work

5444148 we have a lock down situation we have cameras but the question we had to answer is what if somebody gets in what are we going to do
5444149 do we have anything to talk about or have we already read all the latest on each others blogs
5444150 proposed cuts in subsidies of up to 30 have been watered down to only 9 to 10 a year until 2011
5444151 revenue and earnings will gradually increase according to plan over the next two quarters of 2008 due to increasing material supplies we are anticipating even greater profitability in the last two quarters of 2008
5444152 it is a little bit puzzling that the shares are fractionally down but our recommendation is to buy the reported figures are very positive operating income was 18 0 better than our expectations and net income was 10 0 better than our forecast
5444153 the cw and our studio partner cbs paramount network television have made the strategic marketing decision not to screen 90210 for any media in advance of its premiere

5444159 man or women if you come through our check point we will stop you
5444160 they are not iraqis they are not muslim it is not our way
5444161 based on the kids evaluations we hit the mark in providing them with activities they wanted
5444162 they wanted a fun experience to enjoy in the here and now while also developing or enhancing skills for use during lifes travels
5444163 what physical physiological and behavioral changes can occur in astronauts while in space
5444164 its tougher for me every time i leave your moms and dads feel the same
5444165 there was a synergy there a sense of i understand what youre going through looking back it was a blessing in disguise that we werent able to connect with the two original astronauts colonel finke certainly understood what these military children are experiencing
5444166 the empty seat at the dinner table night and after night is a constant reminder of a childs worry for his or her parents safety
5444167 just as their parents are but they have extra hurdles to clear burdens to bear the sons and daughters of our all volunteer force also serve this nation we have a sacred responsibility to care for them
5444168 to provide outstanding young military leaders an unsurpassed opportunity to achieve fluency in a foreign language pursue graduate study at an overseas university and acquire an in depth understanding of foreign cultures thereby further equipping them to serve in positions of great responsibility as senior leaders in the united states armed forces
5444169 ceea ce pot sa va spun din sedinta biroului permanent este ca toti colegii mei au fost in unanimitate de acord cu rapoartele privind inceperea urmaririi penale
5444170 how can a rational individual truthfully believe that being given something by a vendor is equivalent to theft
5444171 i think its a good use of resources it doesnt put any officers in danger which is a good thing
5444172 you can sit at a computer and find exactly where a suspect goes
5444173 law enforcement has a legitimate right to try to solve crimes and track suspects provided that there are protections so that the innocent are not improperly snooped upon
5444174 our main point with this is that before installing a gps tracking device secretly on someones vehicle a judicial officer should make the decision about how much evidence is good enough how long the tracking can be for and the parameters of the tracking
5444175 i want to point out its very easy to get a warrant if the police have a good reason it doesnt take a long time and if there is a real reason the warrant will be granted
5444176 its a lot more like a police officer tagging along inside your car an invisible police officer inside your car
5444177 the question always comes down to how much are we willing to give up in freedom and privacy for how much marginal increase in our security
5444178 i really dont know that there are that many people with set hours monday through friday
5444179 but this year im forcing the kids to reuse their backpacks
5444180 they each cost 50 they like the special cool ones and theyre still holding up
5444181 ive got two teenage boys and they like the brand names
5444182 they shant expect that this year were a cheap bunch here at this house anyway
5444183 i just see the image of this family in american suburbia loading their kid into a suburban and driving them to school thats whats been going on

5444579 your work is both good and original unfortunately the part that is good is not original and the part that is original is not good
5444580 the board members are working hard to reach a consensus and promptly hire a police chief
5444581 the average patrol car drives 39 miles a shift which is wonderful news
5444582 it was up from like 20 miles a shift when i first came back
5444583 in any event i think even to the degree that officers are out in the car being visible more frequently i think the impact will be relatively modest in dollar amount
5444584 lest i should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of satan to buffet me lest i should be exalted above measure
5444585 at first i thought id have pants underwear on for the scene apparently not
5444586 but ive sort of done that before on stage its all old hat now really
5444587 i think it is time we had a little chat johnny
5444588 now one could get all huffy and puffy and blame microsoft on this state of affairs but in this case i have to lay this problem strictly at the feet of the open source community i know for a fact that de icaza and microsoft have pretty much a completely open relationship they give him free flowing access to all the net api documentation and their developers he spends a good amount of time on the microsoft campus in redmond and novell and microsoft are committed to both making net run on linux however novell and microsoft can only do so much to have the community contribute efforts to keep net development at pace on linux with windows

5444590 you dont know how long weve waited for video4linux2 support
5444591 use flags are set on by default because support for what it controls is required
5444592 one of the changes is departing from an environment thats become a second home
5444593 not only do they think theyre better by taking over shows that people actually want to watch but they rub it all in your face by doing it to every damn channel starting from 2 to 22 i would blame those channels for stupidly sponsoring the olympics but you cant blame them because the olympics have created so much hype that if i didnt hate the fucking olympics i too would sponsor them and i hate sponsoring
5444594 but have you ever thought of what the olympics come to symbolize
5444595 yeah good for your bro kidd tell him my mom thinks he symbolizes somethingg
5444596 hear your bras that phelps guy go him hanging in a pool with other fucking guys in their underwear thingies speedo shorts whatever the junk still shows gooo him
5444597 no maa what dooo the olympics symbolize please enlighten me
5444598 you should be proud and try to cheer for the u s its fun when they win just watch
5444599 ah fuck i cant even swim to the other side of the pool
5444600 users are already using these social networks and theyre going to be in one form or another part of the business experience
5444601 what i think is important is the education of users
5444602 just like we had to educate users that they shouldnt click on attachments in email from somebody they didnt know theres just some best practices that were going to need to teach end users around these tools so that they better protect themselves
5444603 ive been thinking a lot about the quote the safest computer is one you bury underground you cover it with concrete and then probably no one will ever be able to break into it
5444604 but you dont get a lot of use out of the computer then
5444605 you can see a rising storm by looking at the index rising interest rates higher oil prices and the beginnings of trouble in the mortgage markets which in turn tainted other structured finance products all impacted the rankings
5444606 todays mobility in the global capital markets puts pressure on emerging markets to build sustainable financial institutions and systems but also challenges developed markets to maintain their competitiveness the capital access index tracks these developments and shows how effectively countries are responding
5444607 development of a strong equity market might generate the largest improvement
5444608 were pleased to pioneer the market once again by launching the two new indicators tracking these dynamic changes in chinas economy
5444609 bolstered by solid market understanding and reliable methodology these indicators provide a scientific way to track the market trends and demonstrate both organizations continued efforts on enhancing the transparency of chinas markets
5444610 these two new indicators provide an at a glance look at how corporate ownership and value are changing based on actual data not just anecdotal information
5444611 this is increasingly important as the chinese economy matures and seeks stable growth and investors are becoming more selective

5444613 this new requirement addresses the need to stop flu transmission at a potential source
5444614 if they would get that done it would be a great relief
5444615 then i wont be so hesitant about her going to preschool
5444616 these vaccines have a very long track record of not only success but safety
5444617 i do not think that this should in any way be required for young children
5444618 there have not been adequate safety studies on this we dont know how children are going to react to this vaccine
5444619 its being able to be given the risks be given the benefits and decide whats appropriate for your child
5444620 and if they do they will want to grant the minimum rights required for your program to run not full trust because not only does full trust grant your program the right to do anything on their system it potentially allows other programs to use your program maliciously to invade their system if you have flaws in your security programming
5444621 the professional developers conference on october 27 and the windows hardware engineering conference the following week represent the first venues where we will provide in depth technical information about windows 7
5444622 i really dont know that there are that many people with set hours monday through friday
5444623 but this year im forcing the kids to reuse their backpacks
5444624 they each cost 50 they like the special cool ones and theyre still holding up
5444625 ive got two teenage boys and they like the brand names
5444626 they shant expect that this year were a cheap bunch here at this house anyway
5444627 i think if parents are going to drive their kids to school and not use bus service thats already available that creates problems
5444628 those choices have to be revisited just like everywhere else

5444633 the iphone with the app store has doubled the number of new daily subscribers and has changed the whole conversation about internet radio
5444634 instead of it being something ancillary or marginal its now being considered as something that might well replace satellite radio if not broadcast radio
5444635 the birth and the sustenance of internet radio is a 21st century phenomenon
5444636 it needs to be differentiated or given enough time to grow and nurture so that it can make it
5444637 it would be a travesty if we lost internet radio in an era where newspapers and newsprint is threatened even television networks are having to reinvent themselves and come up with new revenue streams
5444638 if the royalties are going to drive the stations out of business then i think the record industry is going to see that thats not in their interest
5444639 i guess its a five letter word greed they just got too greedy they wanted too much they should be paid something but it needs to be more reasonable especially considering the fact that broadcast radio pays nothing
5444640 i believe what will happen is that the record labels will begin to have a more friendly attitude to the industry and be more accommodating
5444641 as mobile telecommunications technology rapidly reaches new levels this new plan is ideal for our customers who utilize the technical data features of modern handsets as it makes it easy for them to fully benefit from their gprs or edge service
5444642 this new plan reaffirms our commitment to ensuring that our customers benefit from exciting first to market technology innovations as well as superior service products and customer care
5444643 my point is not to engage in a blame game
5444644 this marks the end of the journal as we have known it
5444645 we will still have a quality newspaper but it will be significantly different from what existed as recently as 10 years ago
5444646 in case you didnt know it the pt is dead
5444647 turned on seemingly obscure language about mid term bargaining that was inserted into the 1995 contract
5444648 was dropped because there werent enough attorneys available to handle it
5444649 but there has been a decline in enforcement actions from 1997 to the present
5444650 optus is incredibly excited to launch this industry first product we are continuing to see a strong thirst in our customer base for mobile wireless broadband and launching a prepaid version means more customers can get online on their own terms
5444651 as well as wireless broadband now being available in pre paid we have launched a new slimline usb wireless modem customers simply connect to their computer like a regular usb device and they are up and running and when they get hungry for more data they can simply recharge
5444652 we have a range of broadband solutions to meet our customers needs and this is another innovative product offering convenience and freedom
5444653 the problem we have faced in the past is producing enough of these coiled carbon nanotubes at a reasonable cost to make a difference
5444654 because our current method produces coiled nanotubes quickly in high yield it can be readily scaled up to industrial levels after formation the coiled nanotubes can be peeled off in one piece and placed on other surfaces to form instant cushioning coatings
5444655 if you move your hand backward as you catch the egg and increase the time of contact over which the impact occurs the impact will be less forceful and the egg will not break it is the same phenomenon experienced in catching a baseball
5444656 our studies with carbon nanotubes have been ongoing for quite some time
5444657 each step along the way has led to the next breakthrough and each time weve learned more about how they grow and what their applications could be we believe that carbon nanotubes have tremendous potential for the lives of each one of us
5444658 unless one has a culture in which education and training are prized admired and respected as activities at the core of the unions work education will often be unrecognized unrewarded and undervalued
5444659 learning will occur whether or not it is planned but it may not be in accord with union goals and values
5444660 good union leaders are not only concerned about the state of their union today or tomorrow they are also concerned about its long term success they look beyond their own time in office and work to ensure the viability of the organization after they are gone one important way to do this is to make sure that the organization has a cadre of people ready and willing to assume future leadership positions
5444661 if you are now involved in the union how much did taking a cmg course trigger your involvement
5444662 my first introduction to the union was through one of these courses
5444663 and it was through participation in the courses as well as interacting with other participants that i felt inspired to get involved i can confidently say that if it was not for education being offered by the union i wouldnt be active at all within the union
5444664 whenever an animal is backed into a corner or its life is threatened we have the instinct to fight back
5444665 youve got a fucking angel on your shoulder joseph i swear

5444667 but joseph you got a whirlwind in your lasso cowboy
5444668 you said to watch for anything having to do with unsupervised female minors right
5444669 two females admitted themselves to saint judes emergency room last night with multiple trauma injuries broken arm jaw et cetera
5444670 theyre holding her there and the other girl the one who brought her in fits the description of that lizzy character from the candy store
5444671 this is detective mike joseph i need a full evidence team at 253 west park street im on site get em here now
5444672 damn it i was here a couple o nights ago
5444673 looks like somebody squirted something flammable under the door and lit it
5444674 something like lighter fluid or anything thatll burn i guess a good way to get people inside a room outside
5444675 who the fuck is in charge of this fuckin circus
5444676 how the hell could you let that girl walk out of here last night
5444677 detective this hospital is not in the business of arresting suspects for the police department
5444678 as a matter of fact the girl left on her own
5444679 we dont have any way of knowing that the pair came in at 12 33 am one was treated for contusions and a broken arm we x rayed her and put on a cast she appeared to be in respiratory distress but refused treatment we asked her to give the rest of her information to the receiving clerk that was the last we saw of her
5444680 couldnt you tell she was lying are you people fucking robots
5444681 i am going to say this one time slowly and clearly we treat injuries and disease thats all if you have a problem with the handling of this incident i suggest you contact the hospital give you her number but beyond that do not speak to me or any of my staff like that ever is that understood chief detective
5444682 hi im from jenkins hall were gonna transport er to county in a bit

5444687 i dont want them to see things they shouldnt see being 4 and 6 years old i want them to go there to have fun
5444688 we saw a boy get out of the tunnel with his girlfriend and pillows which scared the crap out of me
5444689 you see boys and girls going into the bathroom together and thats just not right you shouldnt have to worry about stuff like that and your kids seeing stuff like that at a public park
5444690 just something that controls it to where parents can take their kids there and feels like their safe
5444691 your cars not starting right your battery may be going out
5444692 i keep looking at my life and wonder why im not dead yet
5444693 can i shoot jack thompson now i been practicing on counter strike source
5444694 a dream that will come true is not a real dream
5444695 when i reached out to the church i felt like i had been condemned because of my lifestyle
5444696 i basically told him in so many words to go to hell
5444697 the church must step forward and clarify it as a disease like any other disease
5444698 if were not willing to tell our members in our churches that being homophobic is a sin then were really shucking and jiving
5444699 in as much as we particularly in our ministry do not encourage unfaithfulness that we call adultery or fornication were not going to change that particular principle
5444700 when we have local agencies to provide testing on sundays after services the numbers of persons actually going in the room and getting tested have been very low
5444701 30 or 40 people have been injured in the crash
5444702 sur une toile ou le mot bienvenue etait brod dans tout les langues
5444703 the system is grounded on testing that rewards schools based on the fraction of their students that pass
5444704 as a result teachers have a perverse incentive to focus their efforts on students who are very close to the pass fail threshold at the expense of their worst performing students
5444705 but also gives partial credit for students who fall short of this highest threshold yet do manage to exceed lower thresholds
5444706 thaksinomics may not have gotten it all right but it is entirely possible that the failure to intervene thaksin style to prevent growing income inequality in asia will sooner or later derail the continents rush to affluence
5444707 about 10 years ago the phrase carry trade made the leap from investment bank trading rooms to the markets section of the wall street journal more recently readers of high end financial pages have been treated to assertions that the carry trade is unwinding with consequences galore for international financial markets my guess though is that the notion of the carry trade and its implications are still greek to all but the most devoted consumers of financial news
5444708 to be sure the productivity payoff has been modest but reforming an advanced economy is a little bit like trying to overhaul a cars engine while the vehicle is running one must expect a bit of sputtering
5444709 commissioners are likely to come and go from the telecommunications industry the telecommunications bar and the congressional committees overseeing the fcc thus for commissioners the costs in terms of future income of alienating telecom constituencies are significant and conduct remedies offer an effective way of spreading around the goodies in ways that keep everyone sweet
5444710 by empowering affluent donors we can apply the skills and ambition to medical philanthropy that have driven the success of the most innovative companies in america
5444711 but the advantages of licensing or self exclusion seem most pronounced when applied to currently illegal substances such as cocaine and heroin heavy consumers of some illegal drugs know they are exercising bad judgment so they might welcome programs short of incarceration that limit their consumption
5444712 after getting this gold it is quite heavy because its not just for me but for everyone who has helped me get here
5444713 two weeks before the world championships i couldnt even walk
5444714 i got my surgery and started preparing for this and here i am
5444715 i didnt think i could stay in third place as there are strong athletes from russia ukraine and china
5444716 it was totally unexpected because all of my competitors were strong

5444720 weve been trying to get kids back into trading cards and what better way to do that than have camps with some of the top athletes were associated with

5444726 international partners have expressed to dhs and congress that 100 percent scanning runs counter to and could adversely impact the implementation of international customs security standards
5444727 officials from the european commission and cbp stated that unless additional resources are made available 100 percent scanning could not be met
5444728 given limited resources cbp and european custom administration officials said that 100 percent scanning may provide a lower level of security if customs officers are diverted from focusing on high risk container cargo
5444729 she looks better now than she ever has done im so proud i love her so much

5444744 there are thousands of investors who own bonds from the auction programs but who are not covered by terms of these deals
5444745 were not the ones controlling the information about the market downturn
5444746 with all of these boys being born that means a war is around the corner
5444747 i am more determined than ever to fight to clear my name
5444748 there are two sides to every story and i guarantee that will come out in the end
5444749 i can honestly say i am absolutely relieved now that there is clarity going forward and i now know what im up against
5444750 shes not interested in talking about it now its a police matter weve got nothing to say anyway
5444751 ive obviously observed the media reports that he has been arrested and charged but i dont have any information about that report

5444753 weve completed the suite of ways in which people can communicate with each other using an iphone adding voice text based and picture instant messaging to the standard phone call sms and e mail functionality of the phone this functionality really adds value to the already terrific iphone experience
5444754 when we launched palringo for the iphone we said that our vocal im functionality would be added imminently weve kept the promise we made to the thousands and thousands of iphone users who downloaded palringo and made us one of the most popular free applications from the app store
5444755 some of the big carriers tout their ptt services but they have the carrier barrier limitation of locking their customers into their networks and only the handsets the carriers support
5444756 that sort of lock in is a 20th century business model and it doesnt wash with savvy mobile users today
5444757 unselfish maybe bob saying it will make it so maybe as captain hell change hope so
5444758 you dont want to focus on anything except the product youre trying to build when youre starting a small company every minute and every dollar counts
5444759 with the mac its really easy to get up and running
5444760 we realized that if you could re imagine customer support as a community conversation between users and the company
5444761 rather than as an overloaded and understaffed call center all sorts of good things will happen
5444762 customers have a lot of ideas and opinions they usually know your product better than you do because they use it more than you do and in different ways
5444763 there are many worthy claims on the attention of the political culture but we simply cant afford to use these claims as an excuse to ignore the financial crunch created by escalating health care costs and the retirement of the boomers tinkering at the margins or appointing yet another blue ribbon commission isnt going to get us out of this mess
5444764 in an ideal world relatively capital poor economies would have better financial systems that would allow them to channel both domestic savings and foreign capital to their most productive uses
5444765 but this isnt an ideal world and rather than asking whether uphill capital flows reflect irrational behavior it would be useful to ask what these seemingly perverse international financial flows are signaling about more basic problems in the institutions buttressing the world economy
5444766 almost daily we see signs of how surging oil prices have changed the six nations of the gulf cooperation council into major players on the world financial stage
5444767 decisions by gulf leaders on how to use their wealth will have global repercussions for decades affecting interest rates and the liquidity of financial markets everywhere their domestic investments will determine which industries and cities thrive whether the regions economies successfully diversify beyond oil and whether they generate enough jobs to employ their young people
5444768 the human capital of israel is worth several multiples of the officially reported size of israels assets as published by the bank of israel
5444769 israel must address the challenges within its educational infrastructure continuing and increased focus on the countrys elementary and secondary education system for all citizens will better prepare the next generation to participate in the global knowledge industries of the future
5444770 barriers need to be reduced to allow for easier entry for entrepreneurs the capital market needs to be expanded and the concentration of ownership in the banking system needs to be cut
5444771 we have to think differently mobilize our talents to make ourselves a better people and show the world that goodwill may be the real force of our time

5444778 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5444779 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5444780 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5444781 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5444782 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5444783 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5444784 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5444785 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5444786 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5444787 depuis que tu es mont dans le train je nai pas vers une seule larme
5444788 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5444789 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5444790 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5444791 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5444792 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5444793 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5444794 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5444795 who are open to doing something on the production side
5444796 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5444797 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5444798 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5444799 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5444800 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5444801 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5444802 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5444803 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5444804 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5444805 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5444806 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5444807 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5444808 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5444809 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5444810 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5444811 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5444812 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5444813 people think you are sometimes manic depressive i think im going to have to ask you to leave the company
5444814 making a sequel to a game is always tougher especially given the arms race were seeing in videogames development
5444815 games do not compete in fun experiences they compete in the number of weapons and unfortunately its easy for someone to compare this game to that game this game has 10 multiplayer levels but this one has 29 so clearly this game must be better
5444816 if you can imagine if movies competed in this way well sure schindlers list was good but i know this three and a half hour long movie think of the value youre getting for your ten dollars it doesnt work that way and unfortunately we still find ourselves competing this way we have to compete in quality not size
5444817 yes we are considering sequels clearly when we are creating a franchise its a long term process we want to keep it and have more iterations because its a big investment at the beginning to launch it
5444818 sony makes plastic instruments work across rock band guitar hero etc
5444819 the tax rate is clearly an important piece of the equity market
5444820 there have been fears that obama would push the tax rates materially higher his apparent moderation on the topic is a clear positive for the equity market
5444821 acknowledges that low investment taxes are pro growth and pro federal revenue and that dividends and capital gains are economically the same a return on capital
5444822 he said his bitter 2001 divorce from a woman he married in russia helped tweak his anger toward feminists and laws he sees as favoring women
5444823 2 millones de euros m s incrementan el d ficit en la peque a poblaci n gaditana de jimena de ellos 800 mil euros corresponden a intereses por impago de la deuda
5444824 por si era poca la carga que deb an pagar los vecinos de jimena por el d ficit acumulado por el psoe durante los ltimos a os una sentencia del tribunal superior de justicia de andaluc a obliga al consistorio a abonar m s de 2 millones de euros a la antigua
5444825 el d ficit acumulado seg n el remanente de tesorer a negativo previsto por la diputaci n provincial de c diz para jimena en su ltimo informe supera los 1 575 millones de las antiguas pesetas cuando en el 2 002 apenas era de 8 millones de pesetas el despegue en el d ficit se produjo principalmente entre 2 004 y 2 007 llegando a superar los 4 millones de euros anuales sin que se espere una reducci n significativa hasta pasado 2 010 todo ello a pesar de la enorme carga impositiva que deber n soportar los vecinos de esta peque a localidad que afronta la peor crisis econ mica de su historia por la dejadez pol tica en los ltimos periodos corporativos

5444827 esta carga viene a rematar la situaci n econ mica de jimena y dejar en evidencia una vez m s la estrategia socialista de dejar hipotecado a este pueblo para que otros paguen sus trampas
5444828 se origina en la d cada de los 90 cuando el entonces alcalde y hoy senador jos carracao decide suspender los pagos a esta empresa forzando un acuerdo para que deje el servicio y se facilite as la entrada de jimena en acgisa que subir a considerablemente los precios del servicio en aquellos a os se hablaba de que se iba a mejorar el servicio y ajustar el coste del mismo pero en realidad llevaban a os sin pagar un euro a la empresa adjudicataria y no s lo encarecieron el servicio sino que adem s ahora nos toca pagar m s de 130 millones de pesetas a las que hay que sumar los gastos judiciales por la evidente negligencia del psoe durante m s de una d cada
5444829 it really opened my eyes because i was so raw and really didnt know much about what i was doing and here i was hanging right there with a guy like vladdy
5444830 he really could reach the top at 205 once he gets the experience
5444831 our mission is to provide a platform for local artists to apply their talent and showcase their creative synergies to another great art form the creation of wine
5444832 the money raised will go directly to the classroom allowing students to participate in programs that they may not normally be able to receive
5444833 the new press release makes it easier for people in the media to list and send information
5444834 im interested to see not only how students will use this technology now but also in the future
5444835 journalists are increasingly comfortable researching and working online across many types of re mixable media and the social media press release merely amplifies prospective source materials

5444837 the plant grows to about 3 feet and is characterized by its night blooming flowers and porcupine like round pods
5444838 if we suspect someone of possessing this contraband we will conduct a field test on them and the student may be subject to losing financial aid from osu
5444839 there is moon plant that grows in front of my grandmothers house
5444840 i was the last one to ingest the seeds by putting them on an arbys sandwich and right before it hit me i saw all my friends go crazy
5444841 i knew it was going to be my turn soon and i was terrified
5444842 i personally thought it was a camp site while my friend clay thought it was children of the corn and my other friend thought it was a dead infant
5444843 right when it hit us we became very violent and incoherent
5444844 my friend threw several beer cans into the washing machine while i threw soup on the walls sticking bread to it
5444845 i would see these people appear out of nowhere and i would say where the hell did you come from they would then reply ive been here the whole time i would just say ok and they would proceed to talk to me
5444846 ironically taken on the name devil trumpet because it contains toxic chemicals called alkaloids
5444847 we sell only about five moon bushes per year because theyre not in high demand
5444848 they only cost 9 99 for a one gallon pot
5444849 we usually see drugs that were popular 10 years ago resurface because of the melting pot effect that takes place at this university
5444850 its not uncommon for people across the globe to bring an illegal substance into the u s for recreational use
5444851 one of my friends got lost in a wall and began rubbing his nose until it started to bleed profusely
5444852 what was really bad is when i got home and walked in the living room butt naked in front of my family
5444853 my dad said brock what the hell is wrong with you all i could tell him is that i got my clothes wet in a water balloon fight and had to take them off
5444854 i had to be sent home from work because i couldnt read the jean sizes to customers
5444855 my eyes were dilated so bad i looked like a cartoon character
5444856 i found myself buying mass amounts of batteries at the store for no apparent reason
5444857 when i got back in the car i realized my mind still wasnt all there
5444858 at all costs never allow the person to obtain a knife or sharp object while using it because you will be asking for serious trouble
5444859 i think i should have died that night but miraculously i survived somehow
5444860 i strongly recommend that no one try to use it excessively or at all
5444861 investors have been trying to put the housing and credit crisis behind them they want to believe were in the eighth or ninth inning but every time news like this comes up they have to readjust their thinking
5444862 and whatever the messenger gives you take it and whatever he forbids you leave it
5444863 just this gesture if she were to put it into an ocean it would stain the whole ocean
5444864 and whatever the messenger gives you take it and whatever he forbids you leave it
5444865 this study will potentially demonstrate that it is the regimen of administration of birth control pills rather than their specific formulation that results in successful treatment of pmdd
5444866 if we can eliminate the hormone cycling we should eliminate the pmdd symptoms
5444867 theyre regulators of mood and emotion so if you can eliminate the metabolites that have been implicated in pmdd you may create a huge benefit for women with pmdd
5444868 we believe this trial will help us understand the underlying physiology which will allow for the development of a range of possible new treatments
5444869 id gain weight my face would be puffy i had horrible cramps and that would get me mentally down the symptoms changed as i matured and had children it gradually became more emotional now it also affects my mental acuity and i can still get down sometimes
5444870 the impairment and reduction in quality of life for women with pmdd during their premenstrual phase is equivalent to people with major depression anxiety disorder and even post traumatic stress disorder
5444871 if we can show that continuous low dose contraceptives are effective that opens up another option that may have a better risk benefit profile than ssris
5444872 many women in our previous studies felt better knowing they were contributing to furthering our knowledge about this disorder and informing subsequent treatment options
5444873 we can give them a gold standard diagnosis if they do have pmdd and if they have something else we can help them find treatment for it
5444874 i know what to do and where to go i have all the information and i know help is there theres such a peace of mind from that
5444875 the more we understand the better we can treat it and the better for everyone
5444876 there is so much lost productivity in women with pmdd just think how much more a woman could accomplish if she didnt have to lose so much of herself and her energy every month
5444877 the pharmacologic agents currently in use adenosine dypridamole and dobutamine are all nonselective agents
5444878 as well dipyridamole a vasodilating agent acts only indirectly by decreasing the metabolism of adenosine to increase its local tissue concentration dobutamine works by increasing heart rate and blood pressure essentially simulating exercise
5444879 because lexiscan is predominately selective for the a2a receptors a 400 mg dose can be given that will saturate the available a2a receptors in patients both large and small while minimizing the impact on the other receptors
5444880 perhaps there is a mentality that you cant beat city hall
5444881 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
5444882 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
5444883 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
5444884 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
5444885 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
5444886 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
5444887 the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
5444888 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain
5444889 no evidence sufficient to support the claim that an observed association between abortion history and mental health was caused by the abortion per se as opposed to other factors
5444890 global statements about the psychological impact of abortion can be misleading
5444891 report of the apa task force on mental health and abortion
5444892 ok what happened is you probably severed your optic nerve it has to be fixed asap the sooner the better
5444893 and while some of these steps may require you to do a little extra work now in the long run it may save you aggravation money and even your house
5444894 its like hes got a little piece of all of us

5444896 what does the future hold in store for us in the congo it certainly holds victory but a distant one
5444897 i spoke to them of the fundamental importance which the congo liberation struggle had in our eyes
5444898 i tried to show them that we were talking not of a struggle within fixed frontiers but of a war against the common enemy present as much in mozambique as in malawi rhodesia or south africa the congo or angola no one saw it like that
5444899 in africa especially the part called black africa because of the colour of peoples skin you can follow a long chain from primitive communism to dots on the map where there are a proletariat and a developing bourgeoisie in keeping with the new imperialist plan of action there is no opposition of any kind between the national bourgeoisies and the neo colonial powers each individual country when drawing up its plan for the liberation struggle must start by treating as its enemies not only the imperialists and the layers on which their strength is based such as the surviving colonial armies and more dangerous still the colonial mentality of their officers but all the noveaux riches importers and emergent industrialists who are closely linked to monopoly capital in the form of bureaucratic capitalism

5444901 more investment risk translates into additional risk for taxpayers and if the additional risk isnt mitigated through adequate diversification it could be disastrous
5444902 consistent with the best practices of other large institutional investors
5444903 other than some process related criticisms the gao study confirms that the board was correct to adopt the new diversified policy
5444904 i expect cme to obtain the required 75 quorum from the nymex members and the majority of the cme and nymex shareholders votes
5444905 reducing the time it takes for commercial and public transportation to cross the border will reduce the economic losses to both countries caused by delay
5444906 governor arnold schwarzenegger and all border governors from the californians aware calaware californians aware
5444907 reducing the time it takes for commercial and public transportation to cross the border will reduce the economic losses to both countries caused by delay
5444908 governor arnold schwarzenegger and all border governors from the u s and mexico should be commended for taking this bold action
5444909 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5444910 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5444911 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5444912 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5444913 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5444914 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5444915 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5444916 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5444917 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5444918 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5444919 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5444920 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5444921 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5444922 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5444923 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5444924 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5444925 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5444926 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5444927 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5444928 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5444929 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

5444939 need for speed undercover features a deep and engaging story of spectacular hollywood style live action that will transport players into the fictional world of the tri city bay area
5444940 working with talent the calibre of maggie q allows us to deliver an unparalleled level of storytelling that will keep players engaged in between 180 mile an hour races
5444941 ive always been a fan of racing games and working on need for speed undercover was an amazing experience
5444942 i was so impressed by the scope and quality of the overall production that goes into a videogame these days it was like any other day on a hollywood set i felt right at home the black box team is doing tremendous work here and i cant wait to see the final game
5444943 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5444944 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5444945 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5444946 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5444947 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5444948 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5444949 they can kill each other but to shoot dead innocent people young students professors it is not possible
5444950 i always knew though not by official documents and information kept from me foreign relations about the existence of an agreement based on dont harm me and i wont harm you between the italian republic and organizations such as the popular front for the liberation of palestine pflp and the plo
5444951 was awarded an extraordinary capability for the direction of italian intelligence agencies and special forces after he received approval for the deal
5444952 according to the deal the palestinian organizations could establish bases in italy enjoyed freedom of movement when entering and exiting the country and could move around without undergoing mandatory security checks because they were protected by the secret service
5444953 during my time as interior minister i learned that plo people were holding heavy artillery in their homes and protected by diplomatic immunity as representatives of the arab league i was told not to worry and i managed to convince them to lay down their heavy artillery and make do with light weaponry
5444954 with the palestinians we get along in a different manner
5444955 only the palestinians can serve as mediators with the red brigades
5444956 the afghans did not go to canada to kill canadians rather it is the canadians who came to afghanistan to kill and torture the afghans to please the fascist regime of america
5444957 remains steadfast in our commitment to the people of afghanistan and will continue to work with the afghan government and the international community to improve the lives of afghans
5444958 if we dont have a plan theres no way the enemy can second guess us
5444959 they dont have soldiers capable of doing x and y i dont trust them
5444960 they over privatized look at their army they dont have guards coosk truckers and the employment of private citizens leaves many things foggy and fishy
5444961 the astonishing fact is that cultivated readers of european tongues may have never heard of kalidasa or of the no less important bhavabhuti bharavi magha and sriharsha
5444962 excused from such performance from and after july 4 2008 pursuant to california labor code sec 2855 a
5444963 may not be enforced against the employee beyond seven years from the commencement of service under it
5444964 emis relationship with 30 seconds to mars has been extremely rewarding and successful for both the band and the company
5444965 the hard work of emis global team and of the band has resulted in sales of 3 million albums and singles multiple awards and a growing global fanbase however we have been forced to take procedural legal steps in order to protect emis investment and rights during contract renegotiations initiated by the band and management we hope to resolve these matters amicably and put them behind us so we can continue working in partnership with the band to take them to even greater levels of success
5444966 we had been signed to our record contract for nine years
5444967 basically under california law where we live and signed our deal one cannot be bound to a contract for more than seven years this is widely known by all the record companies and has been for years in fact so aware of it are they that they desperately try to make deals outside of california whenever possible it is a law that protects people from lengthy unfair career spanning contracts this law also gave us the legal right to explore other possible opportunities
5444968 we have been sued by the corporation quite simply because roughly 45 days ago we exercised our legal right to terminate our old out of date contract which according to the law is null and void
5444969 we terminated for a number of reasons which we wont go into here
5444970 the next record we make will be used to pay off that old supposed debt
5444971 so we have lost many of the people that were near and dear to us at virgin emi and crucial to the success of 30 seconds to mars a few of the great ones are still there but it is hardly the same company we have known
5444972 its a huge huge sport in brazil and they grow up playing it
5444973 you get everyone playing it and youre going to have some good players
5444974 people are cheering people are participating thats why its so beautiful
5444975 the life on the beach is a lifestyle we enjoy
5444976 theyre going to be tough to knock out they step up big at big times
5444977 in a situation like this a heated contest its just not the right thing
5444978 they were a little frustrated with themselves and they were taking it out on the ref
5444979 i said i thought thats a little quick just a little quick on the draw
5444980 it did not affect the game so it is ok
5444981 it is about judgment i think he tried to do his best
5444982 if what you say about me is true may allah forgive me and if what you say is not true may allah forgive you
5444983 and whatever the messenger gives you take it and whatever he forbids you leave it
5444984 individuals taking antidepressants should be aware of the possible cognitive effects as they may affect performance in social academic and work settings as well as driving abilities
5444985 however it appears that mood is correlated with cognitive performance more so than medication use
5444986 so heres a cat with an eggplant on its head
5444987 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5444988 if we dont go on and move its going to continue to deteriorate so were at a crucial point
5444989 i see him as the precursor to martin luther king
5444990 not only was he an organizer he was a humanitarian an entrepreneur he was an author he took care of the poor he spoke for the disenfranchised he was the person who was recognized and well respected in both communities african american and the white communities
5444991 the waltons are concerned they dont want to infuse money into this project and then were not able to maintain it and thats a legitimate concern
5444992 the older ladies would teach us how to usher and wear our gloves
5444993 here we are a national landmark building and if we lose it you cant get it back
5444994 i would hate that if we didnt complete this thing you would pass by and say that used to be a national landmark it would be a tragic loss
5444995 soy como un perro detr s de los coches que no sabr a que hacer si atrapa a uno de ellos
5444996 the stream of peoples activities around your email topics and contents
5444997 since what i am doing isnt as bad as what they did clearly i am not a racist
5444998 well i was born to two african parents so i should be able to blend right in
5444999 your face doesnt show that you have suffered the people in my country have suffered a great deal and it shows in their faces
5445000 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5445001 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5445002 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5445003 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5445004 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5445005 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5445006 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5445007 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5445008 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5445009 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5445010 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5445011 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5445012 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5445013 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5445014 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5445015 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5445016 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5445017 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

5445034 when the news was announced unionbancal was already a fairly valued financial institution
5445035 this agreement will provide us with a wide range of opportunities to expand our presence in the us market

5445040 little or no attention is being paid to the long term fall in oxygen concentrations and its knock on effects
5445041 the o2 concentration of the atmosphere has been measured off and on for about 100 years now and the concentration at 20 95 has not varied within the accuracy of the measurements only in recent years have more precise measurement techniques been developed and the tiny decrease in o2 with increasing co2 has been actually measured but i believe the o2 concentration is still close to 20 95 there is so much o2 in the atmosphere it is believed not to be substantially affected by vegetation but it is the result of geochemistry in deep ocean sediments no one really knows for sure since too much o2 is not good for humans the human body keeps o2 concentrations down to around 5 in our major organs extra o2 can give you a burst of energy but it will harm you or kill you if the exposure is too long it has been estimated that global wildfire risk would increase greatly if o2 concentrations were much more than they are now to say that there is an impending oxygen crisis on earth is the epitome of fear mongering
5445042 this is the sort of story i would expect in the supermarket tabloids next to a picture of bat boy for the uk guardian to say there is a oxygen crisis is not only ignorant of the facts but simple fear mongering riding on the coat tails of the co2 crisis i really wish the media would do a better job of researching and reporting science stories this example from the guardian shows how bad science and bad reporting combine to create fear mongering
5445043 the reality is of course that the oxygen percentage in the atmosphere has been 20
5445044 it may be useful to mention that the oxygen is only 1 5 of the atmosphere and the atmosphere is just 1 1 200 000 of the mass of the earth
5445045 there is a simpler way to see that man made changes to the oxygen levels are trivial and we will look at it now
5445046 virtually all other compounds participating in the relevant chemical reactions are either liquids or solids which is why they dont influence the composition of the atmosphere and we can ignore them
5445047 when you realize what the words above mean you will see that the man made decrease of o2 is controlled by the increase of carbon dioxide theyre inseparably linked to one another
5445048 hed let people pummel him it was as if he wanted to train his body to receive these messages of punishment and absorb them faster than any other fighter could absorb them

5445050 this i think is one of the things that i think has happened throughout the campaign theres a set of assertions made by senator clinton and her husband that are not factually accurate
5445051 that is simply not true while i was working on those streets watching those folks see their jobs shipped overseas you were on the board of walmart
5445052 we have two choices in order to consolidate these either opt for all purpose services such as facebook as tens of millions have done or use our blogs as the aggregation point or hub for all these various services facebook for instance allows you to share photos aggregate your digital droppings share comments with friends and exchange messages but it doesnt give you a unique identity on the web in contrast blogs with social features could allow you to do exactly that
5445053 blogging isnt for everyone for those who want more control over their online data and destiny i think blogs and blog based tools are the best route
5445054 providing social features to your community doesnt mean you have to give up control of your community to a giant media entity managing a community online is something you can do yourself using easy to use open tools

5445057 we spent our spring season focusing on everyone being on the same page
5445058 weve helped our freshmen from 2007 to understand the bigger picture earlier in their career usually we wait until their junior year to make them understand but we need their help transitioning the 2008 freshmen class and for the most part they have all responded well
5445059 we believe there is enough versatility in our freshmen class to fill the holes that we identified in the spring
5445060 this is a very athletic group of freshmen i feel it is a class that represents my philosophies of working hard wanting to improve and taking ownership of your own improvement

5445067 a new study projects how seriously global warming will affect different areas of the united states and mexico the bottom line is that southern california northern mexico and western texas will be the climate change hotspots in coming decades
5445068 people there can go right on denying the reality of anthropogenic climate change
5445069 extreme climate change has been with us throughout our human history wineries in the northern british isles where grapes dont grow now annual ice festivals on the thames in the late 18th and early 19th centuries ice on the nile a year where the world had no summer 1816
5445070 while it may be warmer than it has been in the past 1000 years it is not warmer than it has been in human history or especially in human prehistory and it has been much colder but it is equally prudent for us to simply look back on the climate history of the last 10 000 years or so and realize that sudden and extreme climate changes have been a part of the global fabric and will continue to be so

5445099 i dont want to make money from the rich i want everybody to get rich i dont believe in class warfare or redistribution of the wealth but i can tell you for example there are small businessmen and women who are working 16 hours a day seven days a week that some people would classify as rich who some want to raise their taxes and their payroll taxes
5445100 dont think it was an accident that the presence of lithuania the presidents lithuania latvia estonia poland and ukraine flew to tbilisi to show their solidarity with the president of georgia because they all have something in common with georgia they lived under russian domination for a long period of time

5445102 when i started saying you know were going to eliminate meals and gifts from corporate lobbyists i remember one of my colleagues whose name will be unmentioned who said well where do you expect us to eat mcdonalds and i thought well actually a lot of our constituents probably do eat at mcdonalds so that wouldnt be such a bad thing

5445105 it was a great night overall and the biggest thing was the team won and i felt like i contributed to that just to get that first one out of the way and hopefully get a second opportunity and build on that
5445106 when his dad wrote me an e mail friday morning i cant tell you i was so excited and so happy to hear that he was going to be getting a big league start
5445107 i thought to myself i sure hope hes a whole lot more composed than what i am i was so thankful and so grateful that hes got this opportunity because ever since hes been at miami university theres been a number of times when he could have very easily pitched it in and said im not going to put all this work into it but he hung in there and look where its got him
5445108 to be honest you kind of think about all the bad things that could happen to you
5445109 you dont want to go two thirds of an inning and be all over the place in that aspect im happy i was able to get a win
5445110 i was impressed with how he bounced back from that first inning
5445111 he got through a very tough part of the order in the fifth
5445112 that was a great sign when his pitch count was rising and he was probably tiring he hung in there
5445113 it was kind of strange because with the first hitter you have some anxiety and nerves
5445114 but i got him on two pitches then i started to miss the zone and i had to struggle i think i was trying too hard
5445115 it was a lot different than i thought it would be
5445116 i was definitely nervous but not as bad as i thought id be i had to battle through that first inning which was unfortunate because it cut my night short i kept it at two runs and just went back to work in the second inning
5445117 we scored three runs early and couldnt polish him off
5445118 i knew he wanted to probably come after me because he didnt want to face our leadoff hitter he wanted to get me out
5445119 i was able to work the count to a full count and was able to lay off a couple of good sliders when he got to a full count i was hoping hed throw a fastball and luckily he threw something up in the zone he actually broke my bat he jammed me pretty good but i guess its better to be lucky than good
5445120 my mechanics are a little off and i have to work on that
5445121 i fell behind too many hitters its frustrating because its usually been one inning
5445122 ive had some great memories from coaching baseball at ayersville and paulding
5445123 my wife sharon who recently passed away loved those kids and i wish she was there she wouldve loved watching him
5445124 i dont even know how to explain it i was thinking my goodness im almost acting like hes my kid i cant imagine what his dad was feeling like but i think i know what his mom and dad were feeling like because i was feeling the same way this morning sunday ive had a few guys make it to the minors and come close to pitching in the majors to have one make and watch him on the big stage what can i say my heart was overjoyed
5445125 its not going to happen if youre coming for that youll be disappointed

5445248 the impact of foreign investment is being considered more and more by governments around the world
5445249 this has had an impact on omers in the past in one specific case related to our bid on a toll road in france
5445250 while our bid was competitive on price we lost the bid as a result of our not having a french partner
5445251 one of the reasons we are establishing omers worldwide is to grow our on the ground relationships with local partners across the globe to support our investment areas to bring successful deals to the table

5445257 a combination of elements such as the price of oil the euro dollar exchange rate and commodity prices have reversed their trend recently

5445274 i literally laughed out loud when president bush made his speech toward russia about how bullying is unacceptable in foreign policy in the 21st century
5445275 there is no reason that we should be antagonizing them on their border it scares me that this oilman president will take us into another war with a much more deadly foe over an oil pipeline through georgia i am a registered republican but enough is enough impeach george bush if he gets us involved in the russo georgian war
5445276 bowed under the weight of inefficient bureaucracies and often rapacious leaders espousing outdated economic models mexico has nevertheless largely managed to crawl out of bitter poverty to join the middle income nations
5445277 analysts close to the ground argue that the proximate cause of musharrafs humbling was his inability to contain food and fuel inflation and more generally his failure to improve the living standard of the great majority of pakistanis who have yet to share in the bounty from asias economic awakening
5445278 reforms that include subsidies and risk rating limits would be enough to induce the majority of people now lacking insurance to obtain it voluntarily
5445279 but research on health insurance markets along with two decades of experience with public insurance expansion initiatives suggest that even with very substantial subsidies as incentives a significant number of americans perhaps a third of those currently uninsured would choose to go without
5445280 on the one hand publicly financed testing of drugs would reduce the resources that must be invested to insure that new drugs are safe and effective on the other funding the program through government savings from negotiating lower drug prices for medicare would reduce the waste linked to the gap between production costs and market prices
5445281 the health care industry is surely riddled with incentive problems that often lead to the delivery of the wrong services to the wrong people and at too great a cost
5445282 our point is that the tendency for medical price increases to outstrip the overall inflation rate is not in itself a reason to think the industry is failing to deliver the goods

5445289 from the arizona business communitys perspective if you need something done in congress the guy to go is sen jon kyl
5445290 his staff and he will spend the time and attention to address the issues
5445291 career has been more focused on national issues foreign relations national security issues issues that effect the country as a whole rather than just an issue that is pertinent to arizona
5445292 both deconcini and kyl are detailed oriented and like the minutia of legislating and the legilsative process
5445293 goldwater and mccain werent or arent as enamored with the process of legislation as they were and are with the bigger global picture
5445294 i believe both kyl and deconcini fall in the workhorse categatory rather than the showhorse category
5445295 to stiffen american resolve to confront the challenge presented by terrorism and the ideologies that drive it
5445296 trying to bring everybody together in that deal was equivalent to negotiating the israeli palestinian peace process
5445297 john mccain has with a few exceptions not had the staying power to be involved and invest the time and energy that it takes to resolve really sticky issues in arizona
5445298 has succeeded by mastering a tactic that is crucial in a body in which any one member can bring the place to a halt as a ploy or out of pique subterfuge
5445299 you can accomplish a lot if youre not necessarily out in front on everything
5445300 rare ability to put an issue on the u s agenda that wouldnt naturally be there
5445301 mccain has earned that moral authority over the years by being patient and making the big play
5445302 many of the problems mccain tackles are entrenched and unexciting they challenge the rules in washington and the cynicism of voters at home

5445310 we saw this risk even when we controlled for physical activity total calorie intake and other possible explanations for the difference in body mass the positive associations between msg intake and overweight were consistent with data from animal studies

5445320 when i was a teenager i decided to try to make it in entertainment i was part of a boy band that made it big in mexico we sold out stadiums with thousands of screaming fans
5445321 i knew also that i wanted to act but in mexico your choices are pretty limited so i auditioned for and got some roles on mexican soap operas telenovelas they were a hit and i became a star in mexico
5445322 i had made one film chasing papi that was the first latino focused film in hollywood
5445323 after i had been studying with her for a while she began to ask me questions like eduardo what are you doing to make your life meaningful
5445324 i was having still having fun but i was empty and not happy
5445325 i made a decision to go live in a monastery just give my life so i sold everything and went to talk to a priest i told him and my family that i was going to go be a missionary in south america
5445326 im so thankful for this angel god sent to me because my life turned around after that leo and i and alejandro formed our company metanoia films it means a conversion or turning toward god that is what has happened in my life everything i do i want to glorify jesus christ because he is the way
5445327 we saw many different scripts for films but nothing was anything we wanted to make so one day alejandro told us i have this story and he told us the story that was
5445328 usually when you make a film you are shooting each scene many times to get just the right feel and the right lighting
5445329 we were shooting in new york and so it was a little crazy sometimes setting up for a scene and hoping that the people and traffic around would work with us were very happy with the end result and got it done in 24 days
5445330 no that didnt come from my family but i did have two really close friends in mexico theyre very well known and for several years have had a public disagreement they wouldnt talk with each other or do anything like that
5445331 im very excited about the stories weve heard because i realize we accomplished what we wanted to do inspire and entertain people im very happy and excited about the results and very thankful to god
5445332 weve had many people contact us about possible projects but we want to be sure they meet our companys guideline to make inspiring educational and entertaining films that people will see and then go to do something for others

5445647 the july inflation number was high but the core inflation gain of 0 3 means the u s federal reserve has some breathing room on inflation some leeway to cut interest rates and theyre going to need it
5445648 first the u s housing market has not reached a bottom were not even close
5445649 people are watching the u s median home price currently about 206 500 when what they need to scrutinize is inventory levels were still at nine month and ten month inventories levels in most regions and a healthy market has only a three four month inventory level so dont look for any economic stimulus from the housing sector
5445650 we have lost more than 400 000 jobs since november 2007 and the losses are likely to continue for at least two more quarters q3 and q4 probably longer
5445651 even with adequate export activity its almost impossible for the u s economy to grow at or near capacity without job growth this workforce contraction will be a major factor in the feds decision to lower interest rates more
5445652 all recessions and expansions start for a reason during an expansion it frequently is a new sector like technology or a social trend such as u s veterans coming back from world war ii ready to marry start families buy homes and spend
5445653 thus far i dont see a catalyst for the next expansion this will also weigh on the fed which will further tip the scales in favor of lower rates
5445654 possibly in q2 2009 if were lucky but most likely not until q3 2009

5445658 en door wie kan deze vreugde in stand worden gehouden
5445659 de liefde is de bron van deze innerlijke vreugde die weer de vonk van liefde is maar liefde is meer
5445660 er zijn er die leven van de trilling van liefde en die groep zou graag opnieuw de liefde als voedsel op deze planeet invoeren zij zouden dit universum willen veranderen naar een frequentie van liefde zodat liefde de kans krijgt zich te verspreiden en andere werelden te bevruchten
5445661 laten we in liefde onze harten openstellen zodat we leren te houden van verschillen en onze wereld openstellen voor anderen om zo de mogelijkheid te hebben om alle naties om te vormen tot eenheid in verscheidenheid

5445667 the social revolution is forcing companies to evolve and redesign any and all strategies that include existing or potential customers and stakeholders
5445668 companies that apply resources to help steer and bolster their brand across the social web create relationships that ultimately pay dividends in the form of customer loyalty and referrals
5445669 those companies reluctant naive or ignorant to the conversations taking place without them will be introduced into social media out of necessity usually in the form of damage control

5445684 you need to take a leadership role if this is going to be accomplished by you and not by an outside group meaning the disclosure project and cseti you have an ideal opportunity that has opened after the end of the cold war to break the cycle of misinformation to make a fresh start
5445685 ive been asked by senator byrd and some others to look into these things and weve gotten close enough to know that these projects do exist but im telling you that with a top secret clearance and a subpoena power from the senate appropriations committee i cannot penetrate those projects
5445686 youre dealing with the varsity team of all black projects so watch out and good luck
5445687 you know everyone agrees with what youre recommending but theres a consensus that if the president does what youve suggested to him and to the cia director that they exert executive power to get inside this operation and disclose it the president will end up like jack kennedy
5445688 we dont need to bother doing that because the group that were up against has technologies that can frustrate any system you can devise
5445689 oh no we have to do this youre just a doctor ive been in all these circles and we have to be careful
5445690 i understand youre going to be meeting with jim woolsey the cia director about such and such on this date
5445691 i wont confirm or deny that but isnt it interesting that you would comment on it
5445692 im a freelance reporter for the wall street journal i understand you had a meeting with admiral woolsey regarding ufos and extraterrestrial intelligence what can you tell me about that
5445693 do you really think a sitting cia director would meet with a country doctor from north carolina about a subject like ufos and extraterrestrials
5445694 look we really want to see you get this done hurry up
5445695 weve been wanting someone to appear who would do this for us at least a third of the people in this covert control group want to see this matter disclosed but we cant do it
5445696 well who the hell do you think i am im just a country doctor here in north carolina i barely have a pot to pee in
5445697 well no you dont understand we can only do things behind the scenes
5445698 you know if you want to get a message to us or to the president all you need to do is pick up the phone dont dial anything just talk or if you prefer just sit in your home office and talk to the four walls because its all being monitored in real time
5445699 more than 10 or 15 per cent of what i have seen and learned you dont want to hear its so damned disturbing most people would commit suicide and many people have by the way
5445700 you know we understand youve had this meeting with the cia director and are providing information to the president but you need to know that those people dont know anything and theyre never going to know anything you should understand that well you should be talking to people like us the people dealing with this are people who do a lot of contract work for the government under work for others wfo contracts and you should be talking to certain think tanks and you should be talking to certain religious orders and certain orders of jesuit priests who have control over the technology transfer and you should be talking to
5445701 well you know if you want to be supported in this just let us help you
5445702 well youre a doctor right so you have really good credit weve checked this out
5445703 well we know you have platinum cards and gold cards just maximise all of them every month 50 000 100 000 whatever get as many of them as you want and give us the numbers and since we run all the supercomputers that back up and monitor the banking system of the world well simply erase those account balances to zero as paid each month
5445704 yes but then if i did that youd own my ass wouldnt you
5445705 i understand youre going to europe soon to meet with certain people connected to the british royal family
5445706 it so happens that im going to be over there meeting with the rothschilds and the people who control the volvo corporation and some of the other big industrial concerns because theyre working with us
5445707 one of my friends whos really interested in what youre doing is one of the leaders of the council on foreign relations ambassador maxwell rabb would you like to come to a meeting with him
5445708 and also the petersons mr peterson was head of the council on foreign relations and his wife was head of the trilateral commission are also working with me and maybe we can get together with them
5445709 you need to know that all these people are reading what you write and are very interested in all of this
5445710 now as you all know we cant believe everything we see and here can you now excuse me i must be on my way

5445716 outbursts on the sun like this have been extremely infrequent over the past 30 years
5445717 what is more we have never had a chance to observe such emissions with the sun at its minimal activity
5445718 such a large cloud of hot plasma has been released into space that even electronic equipment on space satellites may be damaged
5445719 if the area of the sunspots does not diminish in three or four days and the emissions continue it may have a serious influence on the magnetic field of the earth

5445724 what the bloody hells going on here nasas name is on the cover and the numbers are 100 times better than their supposed to be this is our atmosphere were talking about
5445725 they knew damn well about this fuel all the way along
5445726 now people who lied for nasa are running the show
5445727 and nobodys doing the math and frankly i find it very disturbing
5445728 the problem is that a huge gigantic engineering project has been built on bad science they dont have the right the break the laws to do it by changing numbers to show the shuttle is safe if the numbers are wrong in the international ozone assessment they need to be right before it goes we need to take a look at this before it launches certification to fly is wrong

5445750 the human brain is always trying to determine why things happen and when the reason is not clear we tend to make up some pretty bizarre explanations
5445751 christians and new agers paranormalists etc all have one thing in common a spiritual orientation to the world
5445752 i believe they do exist but im not sure about this
5445753 i guess we will find out if this is on the up and up
5445754 while it is difficult to know for certain the tendency to believe in the paranormal appears to be there from the beginning
5445755 what changes is the content of the paranormal for example very few people believe in faeries and elves these days but as belief in faeries faded other beliefs such as belief in ufos emerged to take their place
5445756 humans first started believing in the supernatural because they were trying to understand things they couldnt explain
5445757 its basically the same process as mythology at one point people didnt understand why the sun rose and set each day so they suggested that a chariot pulled the sun across the heavens
5445758 they didnt understand why a child was stillborn or why a drought occurred so they came to believe that such events had supernatural causes
5445759 all societies have invoked the supernatural to explain things beyond their control and understanding especially good and bad events
5445760 in many places even today people believe that disasters or bad luck is caused by witches or curses
5445761 i believe that new orleans had a level of sin that was offensive to god and they are were recipients of the judgment of god for that
5445762 paranormal beliefs are very strongly negatively related to religious belief
5445763 this may partly reflect opinions of christians in the samples who take biblical sanctions against many paranormal activities seriously
5445764 although the writers strike ended in february the effects are going to continue to be felt throughout the year

5445806 i think he has credibility for the work he has done and i think he deserves respect but i cant say that he is right because i either havent achieved his level of

5445832 and he never denied anything he just brushed it off until i put the heat on a little more and then he went underground to write a book about what perhaps his experiences with the gang and his involvement and his adventures since then sure to be a good read especially when the truth hits the fan
5445833 showers was a terrible piece of misdirection guess maybe they went for the short brief intense surprise strategy at the very end time of the circumstance
5445834 was just pondering between the lines of the common feed
5445835 clearly they stood in front of the flomaton rays too long
5445836 ya know if you practiced being nice away from people it might come a little easier in public

5445844 did you ever have any interest or belief in rchs theories or were you there for purposes of seeing things that could be debunked or what
5445845 assertion that claims which have not been proven true must be false
5445846 theyre just annoyed because the cc blog is invisible to them
5445847 ww wouldnt want any friends to post then be prosecuted back at fshod
5445848 we would be badly off indeed if we were capable of enthusiasm only for the things in which we have faith if that were the case humanity would still be pursuing its existence in a hole in the ground for everything that has made it possible to emerge from the cave and from the primeval jungle appeared in its first hour as a highly dubious undertaking nonetheless we have been able to grow enthusiastic over our vision of these unconvincing exercises we have put ourselves to work for the sake of an idea seeking by magnificent exertions to arrive at the incredible and in the end we have arrived there beyond all doubt it is one of the vital sources of human capability that we are able to kindle enthusiasm from the mere glimmer of something improbable difficult and remote
5445849 it is our duty as human beings to proceed as though the limits of our capabilities do not exist
5445850 you gain strength courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face you must do the thing which you think you cannot do
5445851 le monde progresse gr ce aux choses impossibles qui ont t r alis es
5445852 we know what we are but know not what we may be
5445853 there are those who look at things the way they are and ask why i dream of things that never were and ask why not
5445854 to become truly immortal a work of art must escape all human limits logic and common sense will only interfere but once these barriers are broken it will enter the realms of childhood visions and dreams
5445855 indeed what is there that does not appear marvelous when it comes to our knowledge for the first time how many things too are looked upon as quite impossible until they have been actually effected
5445856 when a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible he is almost certainly right when he states that something is impossible he is very probably wrong
5445857 scientists have proven that its impossible to long jump 30 feet but i dont listen to that kind of talk thoughts like that have a way of sinking into your feet
5445858 it is not a lucky word this name impossible no good comes of those who have it so often in their mouths
5445859 when i was younger i always did it for half an hour a day why sometimes ive believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast
5445860 the future belongs to those who see possibilities before they become obvious
5445861 this became a credo of mine attempt the impossible in order to improve your work
5445862 the only way to discover the limits of the possible is to go beyond them into the impossible
5445863 argue for your limitations and sure enough theyre yours do you
5445864 despise no man and consider nothing impossible for there is no man who does not have his hour and there is no thing that does not have its place
5445865 only he who attempts the absurd is capable of achieving the impossible
5445866 what we can or cannot do what we consider possible or impossible is rarely a function of our true capability it is more likely a function of our beliefs about who we are
5445867 impossible is a word to be found only in the dictionary of fools
5445868 i have learned to use the word impossible with the greatest caution
5445869 nothing is impossible for the man who doesnt have to do it himself
5445870 when you say that something is impossible you have made it impossible
5445871 its difficult to say what is impossible for yesterdays dream is todays hope and tomorrows reality
5445872 to achieve the impossible it is precisely the unthinkable that must be thought
5445873 we are continually faced with great opportunities which are brilliantly disguised as unsolvable problems
5445874 impossible is a word that humans use far too often
5445875 my son the battle is between two wolves inside us all one is evil it is anger envy jealousy sorrow regret greed arrogance self pity guilt resentment inferiority lies false pride superiority and ego the other is good it is joy peace love hope serenity humility kindness benevolence
5445876 to be clear here i am not saying that we should not develop and test such simple recursion based electro resonance devices which bearder is proposing merely that we should give up the silly childish notion that the inertia which by charge cascading between frequencies due to self similarity compression is somehow free energy
5445877 the white arrow points at the snr 359 1 00 5 region where intense radio bursts repeated five times spaced 77 minutes apart on the night of september 30 2002 to october 1 2002 followed by another on september 28 2003 and perhaps a third in 2004
5445878 the robotic cassini spacecraft now orbiting saturn recently drifted in saturns shadow for about 12 hours and looked back toward the eclipsed sun such a breathtaking saturn eclipse has never been seen before arrow points at tiny dot of earth
5445879 back in 1988 he discovered anti gravitational effects of the chitin shell of certain insects
5445880 in a culture which today merely wonders in stupid lifeless pallor when their climate goes into chaos just after they cut a mountain ley line in half to install a new highway without even checking whether a magnetic line is going to bleed something no surgeon would be imprudent enough to do
5445881 woo woo adj concerned with emotions mysticism or spiritualism other than rational or scientific mysterious new agey also n a person who has mystical or new age beliefs
5445882 this path of risk for apophis 2036 is typical of that for any neo with a potential earth impact measurement uncertainties extrapolated many years into the future
5445883 no not the actual book nope got much of it online though through various boards sources etc
5445884 there seemed to be a bizarre reverse cassandra effect operating in the
5445885 these i g farben criminals not the lunatic nazi fanatics are the main war criminals if the crimes of these criminals are not bought to daylight and if they are not punished they will represent a much greater threat to the future peace of the world than hitler if he were still alive
5445886 its important to remember that not everyone copes with events in the same way and in the immediate aftermath of a collective trauma it is perfectly healthy to not want to express ones thoughts and feelings
5445887 this perfectly exemplifies the assumption in popular culture and even in clinical practice that people need to talk in order to overcome a collective trauma
5445888 instead we should be telling people there is likely nothing wrong if they do not want to express their thoughts and feelings after experiencing a collective trauma in fact they can cope quite successfully and according to our results are likely to be better off than someone who does want to express his or her feelings
5445889 however we found exactly the opposite people who chose not to express were better off than people who did choose to express
5445890 we assessed various alternative explanations in secondary analyses but nothing else accounts for this effect
5445891 in order to turn this industry into a national asset we need to dramatically increase access to capital and the best way to do that is collaboration between the private and public sectors
5445892 israel also needs structure including a national food and drug administrative body to regulate clinical and genetic trials this kind of regulatory certainty will encourage biotechnology firms pharmaceutical companies and philanthropic funds to invest in israeli projects at different stages
5445893 historically insurance has been an essential part of stability and recovery for individuals businesses and communities encouraging recovery economic growth and prosperity
5445894 we need to rethink how we approach catastrophic risk and private public partnerships in this field so that communities have the resources necessary to recover quickly in the event of a disaster
5445895 expanding the investor pool for insurance linked securities will help diversify investor portfolios at attractive returns
5445896 if we can do this and streamline the transactions for insurers sovereign entities and other risk bearers this market will have a tremendous positive impact on disaster recovery
5445897 the headlines about subprime and oil prices tell part of the story
5445898 but looking at the ripple effects throughout the economy illustrates the real impact that americans will feel at the ground level were fortunate however that timely fed intervention and globally integrated markets can help ease both the severity and the duration of the down cycle

5445928 a big truck i think its red a ram charger maybe its white
5445929 so where you going to take me for a cocktail
5445930 it doesnt take much insight to realize that wars have been getting worse every time worse from the point of view of the civilian more and more destructive more and more total well clausewitz is about that
5445931 therefore my book is a very end of the world sort of thing
5445932 we dont even know what our desire is we ask other people to tell us our desires
5445933 we would like our desires to come from our deepest selves our personal depths but if it did it would not be desire desire is always for something we feel we lack
5445934 we describe them as normally good peaceful and so forth whereas in reality they are competitive in a war like fashion
5445935 joining the mob is the thing that people dont realize they feel the unity but dont interpret it as joining the mob
5445936 if you scapegoat someone its a third party that will be aware of it
5445937 it wont be you because you will believe you are doing the right thing you will be either punishing someone who is guilty or fighting someone who is trying to kill you but you are never the one who is scapegoating
5445938 the first culture which rebels against that system is the jewish culture
5445939 show a narrator who is surrounded by a crowd of good for nothings who are trying to encircle him and turn him into a victim
5445940 its a small community but hes been the dictator for years everybody loves him he does no one any harm
5445941 one fine morning he wakes up and everybody is against him his three friends are ready to explain how bad he is now and everybody is ready to explain how bad he is at the same time he has turned from the absolute hero to the scapegoat of the community job is like a long psalm and shows you what happens to communities no myth will ever show you that
5445942 jesus accepts to be the victim and we dont really know why
5445943 there what the gospel said is that it is god himself who has allowed all this scapegoating and says you can forgive me since now i am ready to become your victim myself
5445944 the world wars marked an important step in the rise of extremes september 11 2001 was the beginning of a new phase todays terrorism still has to be thought through because we havent yet grasped that a terrorist is ready to die in order to kill americans israelis or iraqis whats new here in relation to western heroism is that suffering and death are called for if necessary by experiencing them oneself
5445945 the americans made the mistake of declaring war on al qaida without knowing whether al qaida exists at all
5445946 the era of wars is over from now on war exists everywhere our era is one of universal action theres no longer any such thing as an intelligent policy weve almost reached the end
5445947 i started working on that book very much in the pure demystification mode cynical destructive very much in the spirit of the atheistic intellectuals of the time i was engaged in debunking and of course recognizing mimesis is a great debunking tool because it deprives us moderns of the one thing we still have left our individual desire
5445948 the debunking that actually occurs in this first book is probably one of the reasons why my concept of mimesis is still viewed as destructive
5445949 yet i like to think that if you take this notion as far as you possibly can you go through the ceiling as it were and discover what amounts to original sin an experience of demystification if radical enough is very close to an experience of conversion
5445950 and this existential downfall is the event that makes a great work of art possible
5445951 they all get together and try to kill him the bible knows that scapegoating is a mob affair
5445952 its a very beautiful story which like many biblical stories is a counter mythical story
5445953 because in myth the lynchers are always satisfied with their lynching
5445954 i respect resistance but get turned on by those who create power
5445955 you still owe me ten bucks and i never said anything
5445956 well not at present but i can see youre really pushing maximum density
5445957 i respect resistance but get turned on by those who create power

5445960 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
5445961 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
5445962 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
5445963 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
5445964 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
5445965 new book out and making the move to open access
5445966 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
5445967 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
5445968 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
5445969 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
5445970 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
5445971 when an action is rationally justified how can reason deny its legitimacy
5445972 this revision of the academic understanding of technology contributes to weakening technocratic rationales for public policy a new era of technical politics has begun
5445973 the schools stare fixedly into the past as we hurtle pell mell into the future
5445974 they are characteristics of the spirit mood language and process of science they are operative wherever evidence of social change can be found
5445975 a new kind of person one who is an actively inquiring flexible creative innovative tolerant liberal personality who can face uncertainty and ambiguity without disorientation who can formulate viable new meanings to meet changes in the environment which threaten individual and mutual survival
5445976 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
5445977 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
5445978 given the high food prices around the world and the need for poor people to lower their cost of food it just does not make sense for the doha negotiations to founder upon this barrier
5445979 working with wto director general pascal lamy the united states india and china should come up with a compromise
5445980 brazil a developing country that is both a major agricultural exporter and home to many poor farmers can help indonesia and australia may be in a position to contribute to a solution too
5445981 a compromise could create a speedy due process for challenges without appeal
5445982 could require examination of factors in addition to increased trade flows
5445983 an alien living among you who wants to celebrate the lords passover must have all the males in his household circumcised then he may take part like one born in the land no uncircumcised male may eat of it the same law applies to the native born and to the alien living among you
5445984 it is with profound sadness that we inform you of the death of marc elkan beloved husband of mindy and beloved father of michelle elkan needle and scott elkan on saturday august 16th 2008
5445985 cable boxes that can access the internet flat panel computer monitors and certain computer printers that can also scan fax and or copy
5445986 the eu committed to bind and eliminate duties on ita products in its wto tariff schedules we believe that these duties are inconsistent with the eus commitments on these products and that they discourage technological innovation in the it sector
5445987 however the eu claims it can now charge duties on these products simply because they incorporate technologies or features that did not exist when the ita was concluded
5445988 in effect the eu is taxing innovation a move that could impair continued technological development in the information technology industry and raise prices for millions of businesses and consumers

5446010 i really really think this is going to really change the way we interact with machines from this point on
5446011 we just wanted to get our hands on one literally to explore how it might be used in the design world
5446012 people really want that more connective experience with their software and hardware
5446013 one of the things that many people dont talk about is how digital photography is giving a lot of the power back to the photographer
5446014 conflict environmental social and political both violent and non violent
5446015 because on top of the worry of being ambushed we had the whole worry about sand in your gear and getting the satellite and getting your pictures out
5446016 sometimes youll be on the phone to someone in london while youre running on a dirt road with rebels around and theres no way you can stop and file but theyre just worried about deadlines
5446017 but i knew what we were looking for a building where employees are pleased to come to work in the morning and still smiling when they leave at night
5446018 once we started going down through the point structure it helped us make decisions that would continually reflect on this idea of employee focus
5446019 this is serious business we cant afford to be down for half an hour or half a day it would hurt not just our volume of business but it would hurt our members feelings that they cant get in touch with us and cant get the car loan they wanted at the moment
5446020 i came from an environment where all there was was fluorescent light
5446021 we used to stick pieces of paper up there to keep it shaded down a little bit just to do anything to alter the light you dont have to do that here when the air is cleaner when its lighter when you can stand up and look out a window or look across the expanse of the call center to exercise your eyes even it makes such a difference
5446022 we had trouble finding and improving entry level people and if we could find them they had to live so far out that by the time they got to work in the morning they were already tired and cranky
5446023 the leed consultant was adamant that they wanted us to turn the building but we dug in our heels and said we cant do that
5446024 our idea was ok these people need help rebuilding so lets bring in the great minds that we can find and that was really exciting for me being the fan that i am
5446025 thats one of the benefits certainly but its not the driving factor
5446026 because these people suffered a horrific event and truthfully great injustice in the aftermath and theyre still suffering that injustice so what are you going to follow that injustice with crap houses with toxic materials and appliances that run up their electricity bills and may lead to a foreclosure i mean really this to me is a social justice issue and to create something thats equitable and fair and has respect and provides dignity for the family within is absolutely essential to rebuilding here
5446027 it felt to me that architecture was trying too hard to make its point
5446028 it can be such a proving ground for so many things its ready for the next evolution we can actually advance the discussion and practice of intelligent design and im not talking about creationism
5446029 we didnt want somebody who said i understand that the means of the homeowners are so modest that the design has to be modest
5446030 we didnt want modest designs we didnt ask for immodesty either
5446031 the only thing we gave them was a coach flight and a crap lunch
5446032 make it right like so many other private organizations and community and church groups is doing its part to move the gulf coast further on the path of recovery
5446033 but while the american people continue to step up the bush administration continues to fail
5446034 if you cant tell these are some of the brightest minds in architecture
5446035 the current plan is to build the houses that are selected by residents
5446036 i dont want any of the national people to leave here without learning at least one word of the local language
5446037 the citizens of the lower ninth ward have been accustomed to getting less than regular so this is an opportunity to go beyond the normal not just the regular stuff something a little bit extra on top of the regular stuff
5446038 maybe the baby is asleep in the back bedroom mammas making some gumbo in the kitchen and grandpas on the front porch entertaining the neighbors
5446039 weve got the devil on one side and the deep blue sea on the other
5446040 if we design for the community were going to be in jeopardy of not pleasing our peers but if we design for the architectural press were going to be in jeopardy of not reaching the community
5446041 they really put forth an idea to think bold to be grand in our ideas not to be caged in in any way
5446042 people said is this a joke and we said no its serious because it takes katrina even more seriously and monumentalizes itself and it shows that it was there
5446043 its to address a wider perspective isnt it and then maybe our design embodies that provocation is good because it pushes people we need architectural michael moores
5446044 if somebody designs a building that people dont want to live in then i would argue that its sculpture
5446045 and maybe that gets to the point about architectures role in the twenty first century are we going to continue to create monuments to ourselves or are we going to start listening are we going to develop a different kind of respect

5446053 the principle behind electric bikes is akin to that behind hybrid cars combine the conventional technology in this case old fashioned pedaling with a battery powered motor the net result is a vehicle that rides a bit like a scooter with some legwork required most models have a motorcycle like throttle that gives a boost while going up hills or accelerating from a stop on some models the motor kicks in automatically and adjusts its torque based on how hard the rider pedals although regulations vary by state federal law classifies electric bikes as bicycles and no license or registration is required as long as they dont go faster than 20 mph and their power doesnt exceed 750 watts price largely determines weight quality and battery type a few hundred dollars gets you an izip mountain bike from amazon with a heavy lead acid battery for 1 400 you can buy a 250 watt folding bike powered by a more powerful longer lasting nickel metal hydride battery like those in a camera or a toyota prius at the high end 2 525 buys an extra light 350 watt model sporting a lightweight lithium ion battery similar to a laptops most models can go at least 20 miles before plugging in to recharge

5446065 a synthetic heparin would have several advantages for patients using unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin which is derived from conventional heparin

5446101 we now have a capability of someone to radicalize themselves over the internet
5446102 they can train themselves over the internet they never have to necessarily go to the training camp or speak with anybody else and that diffusion of a combination of hatred and technical skills in things like bomb making is a dangerous combination
5446103 those are the kind of terrorists that we may not be able to detect with spies and satellites
5446104 they can train themselves over the internet they never have to necessarily go to the training camp or speak with anybody else and that diffusion of a combination of hatred and technical skills in things like bomb making is a dangerous combination

5446107 what is googles secret weapon an army of ph d s
5446108 my proposition is that we cancel it at once and that i hand you this check for ten thousand dollars
5446109 you came to us as general sales manager on january 1st 1922 at a salary of twenty five thousand dollars it was by far the largest salary we had ever paid in any executive position but your record seemed to justify it
5446110 the letters you brought spoke in the highest terms of your sales genius the only question which they did not answer to my satisfaction was why companies which had valued you so highly should ever have allowed you to get away when i voiced this you stated that they merely had been outbid by their competitors and i accepted your statement it wasnt until you had been here a year that i learned the truth you are a quick starter but a poor finisher no finisher at all in fact
5446111 nobody needed to tell me i found it out from your effect on our own organization
5446112 and you may be right our folks have mostly grown up in our own business they know comparatively little of the way in which things are done in other lines thats what we wanted you to teach us and you were very sure that you could we were all receptive
5446113 your folks were jealous from the day i arrived they sat back and dared me to show results i told you that six months ago
5446114 and my answer is just what it was then you claim to be a brilliant salesman and yey you failed in the first essential you never sold
5446115 you brought your own assistants and we paid them high salaries
5446116 you moved our offices away from the plant and took these expensive quarters in the center of town
5446117 thats the stubborn fact which cant be blinked and now its come to a point where i must choose between you and my good old wheel horses who in spite of their mediocrity have somehow managed to build a very profitable business
5446118 you can stay here until your contract expires but you will have no further responsibilites the news will get around that you are merely hanging on and when the end comes you will step out discredited to look for another job or you can leave now with ten thousand dollars which is the additional penalty i am willing to pay for my mistake in judgment if you go in the proper spirit you are still young enough to profit by your failure
5446119 i want you to wear these two pairs of shoes on alternate days and watch them carefully later on i will ask you to tell me about them
5446120 ive had them half soled and they are as good as new
5446121 and i want them to be a lifelong lesson to you there are just two grades of commodities in the world the best and the others my experience is that it pays to buy the best and what applies to things applies equally to men pick out the best men for employers and when you get along in life pick out the best men for employees never mind what the price mark may be the question is what service will they deliver and how long will they wear
5446122 youve got everything that college can give you except a diploma
5446123 the big future in the grocery business is in chain stores
5446124 i know the business you have twenty thousand dollars i know a city where we can buy two good little stores for that amount in cash and pay off the balance out of the profits when we get those two going right well buy another and another until we have a big chain its a sure fire fortune you think it over for a few days and if you want to hook up with me let me know
5446125 ive just been over to booneville and got an option on the best store there
5446126 were short of working capital as it is and i dont see how we can spread out our time any thinner
5446127 ive been over to the bank and theyre willing to take a chance on us it will be a tight squeeze for a few months but well make it and as for spreading ourselves too thin dont you ever make the mistake of tying yourself down to this desk nobody gets anywhere by doing all the work himself well take ferguson
5446128 and make him manager here while we step over to booneville and breathe the breath of life into that dear old town
5446129 one of the five things i find out before i employ a man
5446130 is whether he can talk and write effectively this may seem a strange requirement but it has been a very useful one if we could unscrew the top of mens heads and look in many of our problems would be eliminated for we could see what sort of thinking goes on there
5446131 lacking that privilege however we have to judge by what comes out of the mind through the tongue and fingers
5446132 the continual use of slang expressions is an evidence of mental laziness and i will not hire a man who depends upon slang to express his meaning it is a substitute for exact thinking
5446133 you know that end of things i want to be free to work on big deals and think out plans for the future of the business father was a darned good man in his day but he got pretty conservative toward the end you and i together will do big things
5446134 he had a definite appointment with me and ive traveled a hundred miles to keep it
5446135 i forgot all about it ill write the old bear a letter and lay myself humbly in the dust
5446136 either ill sell my interest or you sell me yours
5446137 you conceive a big idea get the whole organization on tiptoes to carry it out and then you lose interest and go off on a new tangent
5446138 he was too mediocre to appreciate anything better than mediocrity
5446139 there is not a single brilliant man in our organization
5446140 i am not brilliant myself i am just an average chap who started in peddling policies and knowing my own limitations felt that i must put in a couple of hours extra work every day in order to hold my own against my competitors
5446141 nobody would think of suggesting any change in the news policies but wont you let me hire two or three really brilliant editorial writers whom i have in mind even you must admit that there is room for improvement on your editorial page
5446142 how did you ever happen to discover the law of graviation
5446143 that is too bad but think what it means you have lived twenty five or thirty years without making a profit on your life how can i expect that you will be a profit maker for me

5446145 the pro smoking ban campaigns often move into an area quickly and hit the local elected officials and small businesses with pressure that they are rarely prepared to deal with as such we are aiming to provide assistance in mobilizing opposition as quickly and efficiently as possible from we have seen in the past lack of organization is our greatest enemy
5446146 as we see it if just one small business suffers a loss however small it may seem then the damage caused by smoking bans is unacceptable were dealing with peoples lives and livelihoods here
5446147 similarly once a company gets off the ground and a founder has a little bit of money in his pocket he must keep in mind what it was like to be on a salary no matter how well you pay your employees their perspective on money will always be different than yours you cant throw money around and expect them not to notice
5446148 man the minute he said ran out of wine while entertaining i was convinced it was a bad deal the only worse social faux pas i can think of when hosting a dinner party is running out of wine and scotch in the same night
5446149 and what pray tell was so amusing about jesus obeying his momma and turning water into wine young lady
5446150 well you just kept going on and on about the social implications of running out of wine jim quite frankly after the second time you mentioned it i began to think of things worse than running out of wine i finally decided the worst would be to run out of wine and scotch at the same time
5446151 its clear you werent brought up in the tea totaling south my dear because few people understand the implications of running out of alcohol and theyd be horrified to think of serving both at the same meal by the way whens the next dinner party
5446152 my favourite bad idea so to speak is the belief that the truth is obvious believe that and you land in a heap of trouble just for starters neither you nor anybody else have any excuse for not recognizing the truth at once or for ever changing your mind about it if you disagree with someone you have to be right because you have no excuse not to be and they have to be evil ditto mayhem

5446201 who knew my editor would be this thoughtful highly verbal but not precociously literate eight year old
5446202 last october i received a reminder email from chris reminding me that id wanted to participate in nanowrimo in november telling me that it was time to get ready i did and in november i joined the fray so to speak i told everyone i was going to do it to create some pressure and i dug around in my journals to find the story and on november 1 i took off unfortunately i had to travel for about a week that month and didnt have time to write my 1667 words a day in the end i wrote only 25 000 words after november ended i didnt look at it again for about five months i felt stuck no idea where i should go next with it in april my 8 year old granddaughter asked me to read my novel to her sure that shed be bored with it i read a couple of pages aloud and stopped she looked at me expectantly and asked so is the story going to start now assuring her that it started in the very next paragraph i gulped and wondered if it really did or if i had spent way too much text on the background information she asked me to read more so i did stopping after every few pages asking if shed heard enough yet she insisted i keep reading when i tired of the read aloud she asked if she could read it on her own for a while until i was rested and could continue reading keep in mind that this is not a childrens book or even a young adult novel although it contains nothing objectionable to either age group so far when i finally finished reading it to her she stopped and thought for a while then she asked me what was going to happen next i admitted that i had no idea and she said she knew what the protagonist needed to do next here let me write it down for you so you dont forget on a napkin she wrote that the protagonist needs to go to town on an errand and meet with someone her advice made good sense it will allow me to include a new setting and some new characters to a story that threatens to become permanently stalled throughout my story one of the characters has a blog which is receiving some angry comments the writer of which has not been revealed yet after telling me what the protagonist should do next she asked me who is writing those blog comments it seems like it is this girl character tracy but i think it should really be her boyfriend jordan instead it fits his personality better and would be better for the story surprising and it would make sense she wrote that down for me also and told me to go write for a while to see if i could find the thread again the kicker about all this for me is that she is absolutely right her ideas are excellent and i intend to follow them now we talk about writing quite a bit and she often urges me to go work on the novel so she can read some more of it she is hungry to continue with the story who knew my editor would be this thoughtful highly verbal but not precociously literate eight year old we seem to have discovered an emerging talent

5446248 i hate the song it clearly promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting katy knows how i feel we are a very outspoken family and she knows how disappointed her father and i are i cant even listen to that song the first time i heard it i was in total shock when it comes on the radio i bow my head and pray
5446249 katy is our daughter and we love her but we strongly disagree with how she is conducting herself at the moment we cannot cut her out of our lives as she is our child but she knows we disagree strongly with what she is doing and the message she is promoting regarding homosexuality which the bible clearly states is a sin but the bible also promotes understanding and forgiveness which i keep reminding myself katy is not a homosexual but i fear she has been led astray by the hollywood crowd i pray all the time that god will work through her and help her find salvation
5446250 some outfits are too revealing and her father has had words with her about it like any child she is going through a period of rebellion

5446262 whether it was voting against or voting present on issues related to stricter penalties on offenders of serious crimes or disallowing citizens to exercise their right to self defense obama demonstrated poor judgment on an important issue to his constituents
5446263 john mccain voted to keep cop killer bullets on the street and opposed the bipartisan crime bills of the early 90s that led to the hiring of thousands of police officers and helped communities stay safe a record that he will have to explain
5446264 second amendment protects an individuals right to own a firearm and he also believes as the supreme court recognized that both the federal government and local communities can adopt reasonable safety measures
5446265 i know of no time when he spoke out against the chicago gun ban
5446266 if you can ratchet back the firepower then you really can do something about the level of violence in urban areas
5446267 the best thing the senate could do is give out more money for more cops
5446268 john mccain voted against these fiscally reckless proposals because americans should expect that their government can fund law enforcement priorities by eliminating the billions in wasteful spending that occurs every year not by further increasing the tax burden on american families
5446269 fiji will still be despite his bainimaramas absence a major feature of leaders discussions in niue
5446270 there is no reason why commodore bainimarama should not attend for those discussions as he did last year

5446273 what do cops want they want to go home every night they want their pay cheque they want the odd donut thats all
5446274 but the fact remains that takuan is neither a bigot nor a fool
5446275 what do cops want they want to go home every night they want their pay cheque
5446276 what do assembly line workers want they want to go home every night they want their pay cheque
5446277 in reality there is nothing wrong or offensive in his statement not if you are not a dreamer who thinks that people become policeman just to serve society and defend the poors and the innocents
5446278 no one must be allowed to defy the police legally or not
5446279 if an innocent person cannot speak with those engaged in law enforcement without fear of negative repercussions then something is horribly wrong
5446280 its ok for them to screw over anyone who insists that they have rights
5446281 but that too has negative repercussions the police will suspect you more if you
5446282 dont break the law in the first place dont be around people who do dont be around any person place of thing having anything to do with drinking or drugging dont get into fights with anyone walk away obey the laws and youll be fine
5446283 way to pick that nit consider this my apology for thinking that readers would be able to contextually figure out that i meant something was wrong when an innocent person had to fear speaking with the police without a lawyer

5446286 cory your commentary misses one very important point the professor is not only advising you to not speak to the police without your attorney but also not to speak to the police whatsoever with or without your attorney
5446287 also when did you forget all your hard earned lessons about not letting takuan get your goat
5446288 clif marsiglio 34 treating others like human beings is always a good idea i highly recommend treating police officers like human beings while telling them that you wont talk without your lawyer present

5446315 we have screwed up not a little but a lot no country in europe has screwed up as much as we have we have obviously lied throughout the past 18 to 24 months it was perfectly clear that what we were saying was not true in the meantime we did not actually do anything for four years nothing we lied morning noon and night i do not want to carry on with this the faith comes from the fact that i am creating history not for the history books i do not give a shit about them i do not at all care whether we or i personally will be in them i do not at all care the governments work is not constructed nicely calmly or scrupulously no no it is being prepared at a mad breakneck speed because we could not do it for a while in case it came to light and now we have to do it so desperately that we are almost at the breaking point

5446317 a human being is a part of a whole called by us universe a part limited in time and space s he experiences self thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest a kind of optical delusion of consciousness this delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty

5446320 i think the thing that sets ouachita baptist apart is the character and religious aspect the university takes on unlike a state school where you may just be considered a number or be identified by your major ouachita provides a small family atmosphere where students feel they belong people know you by name and know your family and professors are willing to invite you into their house the christian atmosphere really makes you feel this is a place you can call home
5446321 students have the opportunity to study with outstanding faculty who will challenge them to learn deeply to experience the world broadly and to live responsibly with small classes a strong sense of community and a shared commitment to christian values ouachita offers students exciting opportunities to shape their futures

5446324 athletes should know about the a tradition of the olympic games
5446325 of late years there had been an enlargement of devon orchards
5446326 a drink both pleasant and healthy much desired of seamen for long southern voyages as more fit to make beverage than beer and much cheaper and easier to be had than wine
5446327 it only infests those that make use of that liquor and in the same proportion as they make use of it so that in those times when cider abounds it increases and becomes very common on the other hand when pomona witholds her bounty it is observed more rarely
5446328 i find that this disease is common all over the county of devon but that it particularly infests those parts of the county where the greatest quantities of cyder are made i likewise find that it is not only common among the lower class of inhabitants but that it is much more frequent among people of all ranks than in other parts of england and that it is not entirely confined to the autumnal season
5446329 there is no lead which can give occasion to that colic used in any part of the apparatus for grinding or fermenting the apples or fermenting the liquor
5446330 all who drank of it were affected by it as the lead workers usually are we had eleven of them at one time in our infirmary
5446331 the large circular trough in which the apples are ground is generally composed of several pieces of moor stones cramped together with iron some melted lead being poured into the interstices
5446332 it is very certain that in various parts of the county of devon there are those who possess certain secrets for the management of cyder the general object of which secret is to correct the sourness and austerity of that liquor i have several times discovered marks of a solution of lead in the english made wines
5446333 i take this early opportunity as its nearly about the cyder making season tho i fear there will be but little made in this quarter this year of acquainting you thereof at the same time advising you cautiously to avoid the least utensil of lead tin or copper
5446334 the breaking or stone troughs held together by means of iron cramps with lead cast at their ends are with ther rollers certainly with some people about us still in use the lead in their construction might be altogether omitted or buried with the iron so deep in the stone as to prevent its being in contact with the apples to admit a thick cover of plaister of paris or the like
5446335 i wish that these experiments were more generally known the circulation of his treatise on that subject being as yet confined to devonshire
5446336 owing partly to the use of crude fruit and its juice not well fermented and partly also to some peculiar disposition of the atmosphere
5446337 it was not uncommon to meet deplorable objects with their hands dangling and who by such imbecility are distinguished by the appellation of the danglers
5446338 wished that the essayist had made his trials from other and fairer specimens
5446339 much of the fruit must in consequence not having equal advantage of the sun and wind be green and crude and the juice austere and sharp the hereford people are also more careful in collecting their apples do not pound them until they are thoroughly mellowed and sweetened
5446340 sulphur of fruits quite a new principle and not to be understood by anyone not even by himself
5446341 it can be proved by certificate that in three parishes only there were at least thirty presses lined with lead this is no hearsay or random assertion
5446342 it may be perhaps of some service to mr more if i publicly acknowledge that he used many arguments to dissuade me from pursuing such an enquiry or even be witness to any experiments which might end in discoveries in any way disagreeable to his very good friends of the county of devon
5446343 my name was entered on the physical line in oxford and i had opportunities if i had but made proper use of them of learning something both of physic and chemistry from a professor in those sciences perhaps not inferior to this great doctor saunders
5446344 for meddling with other subjects and confine them merely to theology would be stopping up some of the principle sources of literature and doing great injury to the public
5446345 it is a fact well ascertained that a malady which from its former prevalence in that county had acquired the name of the devonshire colic is at this time hardly known to exist there
5446346 in the early part of his career some forty years ago occasionally saw cases of lead colic produced by drinking cider made in a lead press
5446347 not for many years seen any case of lead poisoning produced by cider he further adds that he believes that there is no more wholesome drink than pure cider

5446418 theres a com petitive nature that exists for recruitment of students or establishing research centers but where the collaborative nature comes in is that its silly to force each of us universities to reinvent the wheel when were tackling global issues that have an impact on all of us
5446419 the rate of change has been so quick that we were pushing for low hanging fruit for years and years and now were talking about major initiatives that cost tens of millions of dollars
5446420 thats a big chunk that we had already gotten out of the way long before we claimed we were going to go climate neutral or even reach the kyoto goals
5446421 the entire room is covered in these sheets of what different groups are doing and were like ok this is everything we do
5446422 how do you call that an initiative when everything were doing involves sustainability
5446423 whats so fascinating about these positions is that we dont directly oversee any of these functions we have no power to do any of it our role is to be a sustainability generalist and then to develop questions and frameworks to understand how these systems work independently and together so that in the aggregate does it lead to a sustainable yale
5446424 part of how i will know that this office has succeeded is by seeing the ideas that come in from other parts of the university
5446425 the stig ma of being one of the ivies is that youre supposed to be a leader in everything

5446427 the presidents who have led this effort see that one of the most important roles and the purpose of higher education is to provide the knowledge necessary for a thriving civil society thats our function but to do that to fulfill that mission we have to deal with the unhealthy unsustainable and ineffable challenges that are occurring in the world today
5446428 is because we only exist to help students find a way to make a contribution that will lead to a good quality of life for themselves as well as for society

5446467 instead of taking a critical journalistic approach to this spin andrea mitchell did what has become a pattern for her of simply repeating obama campaign talking points

5446469 i cheated a little bit i actually looked at this idea ahead of time and i think it is a great idea
5446470 i havent got a clue to be honest with you i havent played many games recently so i honestly cant say

5446474 i will wait and see if i can get into the team if not then obviously i want to play so we will just have to take it from there
5446475 we have spoken about it but at this time i dont think i will say too much more
5446476 theres no doubt i would like to go to a major tournament i havent been for a few years and that appeals to anyone

5446478 i was fortunate enough to go in 2002 so that enticed me to come back
5446479 when i met the manager at the end of last season it changed my mind

5446481 but when i met the manager i liked what i heard so i made that decision
5446482 he has got a lot of experience and just the way he was talking about certain things i suppose he persuaded me to come back

5446508 is broken and needs to unite for the common good of the african american community
5446509 the problem right now is that we dont have a unified agenda thats enforced back in the community and is clearly articulated everybody tends to be lone agents in these situations

5446538 the earlier concept of a universe made up of physical particles interacting according to fixed laws is no longer tenable it is implicit in present findings that action rather than matter is basic this is good news for it is no longer appropriate to think of the universe as a gradually subsiding agitation of billiard balls the universe far from being a desert of inert particles is a theatre of increasingly complex organization a stage for development in which man has a definite place without any upper limit to his evolution

5446653 the doctor said well it looks like hes got all the symptoms of west nile virus
5446654 i called the state health department because i needed to know how long he was going to be sick
5446655 i was just bawling i thought he was going to die
5446656 he was diagnosed with epstein barr virus which is pretty much the same thing but you dont die from it
5446657 i dont blame him because all the doctors are doing it
5446658 id like to know how many people have been told they have west nile
5446659 this has been going on since west nile came into utah some doctors will base things on symptoms and not do tests
5446660 like any medical test they can be expensive and if people dont have insurance then sometimes the doctor will go ahead and try to help the patient
5446661 whether theyre helping or not may be something of a question
5446662 he said well it sounds like youve got west nile
5446663 it was really strange it was just contradictory to what we had heard on the news and what seemed to be happening everywhere
5446664 i ended up going to the doctor in the springtime
5446665 they found out that i was really anemic the question i have now is did i ever really have it am i immune to it am i going to get it again
5446666 people who have been told they have it are out on the lake not really worrying about it
5446667 i cant imagine how many people have been told that
5446668 maybe theres something seriously wrong that they dont know about and they say nah its west nile
5446669 we try to do education for physicians and stuff like that thats the best we can do is try to educate people of what tests to draw and those kinds of things

5446677 a british historian argu ed that the critical technology for the early phase of the industrial revolution was gin the transformation from rural to urban life was so sudden and so wrenching that the only thing society could do to manage was to drink itself into a stupor for a generation and it wasnt until society woke up from that collective bender that we actually started to get the institutional structures that we associate with the industrial revolution today things like public libraries and museums increasingly broad education for children elected leaders a lot of things we like didnt happen until having all of those people together stopped seeming like a crisis and started seeming like an asset it wasnt until people started thinking of this as a vast civic surplus one they could design for rather than just dissipate that we started to get what we think of now as an industrial society
5446678 if i had to pick the critical technology for the 20th century id say it was the sitcom starting with the second world war a whole series of things happened rising gdp per capita rising educational attainment rising life expectancy and critically a rising number of people who were working five day work weeks for the first time society forced onto an enormous number of its citizens the requirement to manage something they had never had to manage before free time and what did we do with that free time well mostly we spent it watching tv
5446679 desperate housewives essentially functioned as a kind of cognitive heat sink dissipating thinking that might otherwise have built up and caused society to overheat
5446680 this is something that people in the media world dont understand media in the 20th century was run as a single race consumption how much can we produce how much can you consume can we produce more and youll consume more and the answer to that question has generally been yes but media is actually a triathlon its three different events people like to consume but they also like to produce and they like to share

5446699 but all machines fail or are superceded still the army worships at the shrine of such things both fascinated and fearful in its guts the army knows it is the sorcerers apprentice it unleashes technology and never again can the magic be stuffed back into the bottle i teach them another magic but the genie is not dead technology breeds anarchy it distributes these tools at random and with them goes the provocation for violence the ability to make and use savage destroyers falls inevitably into the hands of smaller and smaller groups until at last the group is a single individual

5446705 to imply that god would do such a thing well okay to each his own however to imply that god would choose to use the bible codes to place the weights on the scale is just so wrong

5446720 the crew of space shuttle discovery will continue to test new equipment and procedures that increase the safety of space shuttles during the sts 121 mission to the international space station it also will perform maintenance on the space station and deliver more supplies and cargo for future station expansion this mission is to carry on analysis of safety improvements that debuted on the return to flight mission sts 114 and build upon those tests
5446721 i am no go based on loss of vehicle risk ice frost ramps based on appeal to administrator i have no intention to appeal his risk acceptance and concur with proceeding with mission
5446722 so the question is can we fly a few times with this ice frost ramp without probably incurring a hazard and based on the data i have seen i believe that we can
5446723 this is fully what we expect to se potentially on sts 121 when we get some of our external photography back we expect to see losses in these regions pretty much similar to what we have seen here so when we see this in flight and you get this data down we should not be surprised
5446724 crew safety is our first and most important concern we believe that our crew can safely return from this mission
5446725 we both feel that there remain issues with the orbiter there is the potential that foam may come off at time of launch thats why we feel we should redesign the ice frost ramp before we fly this mission we do not feel however that these issues are a threat to safe return of the crew we have openly discussed our position in the flight readiness review open communication is how we work at nasa the flight readiness review board and the administrator have heard all the different engineering positions including ours and have made an informed decision and the agency is accepting this risk with its eyes wide open

5446798 with school starting before practice i was more prepared better than i had ever been we had a chance to meet some last week and we had camp and everything this summer so we knew where we were at we still met and went over things i don t think the start of school hurt us i was more worried about what kind of time we d get practice wise we decided to do a couple days of two a days usually we did four then our evening practices will just be a little longer like 30 40 minutes
5446799 we worked on our defense it was a defensive morning so we did what we d do at any other practice we do our conditioning in the morning and then we don t do near as much in the evening when it s warmer but we ve been very blessed with the weather we re going right after school today in the past we hadn t been able to do that with the heat
5446800 some of the sophomores have to be there earlier because they set up gear and the quarterbacks have to be there at 5 30 to warm up in the afternoon we ll have quarterbacks at 3 20 everyone else at 3 30 they do pre practices for 10 minutes we do review sets with the skill guys and the o linemen will walk through play review then we all stretch at 3 40

5446808 we didnt have too much to test a couple of new tyres and thats about it but we managed to find a new setting to improve and i dropped by lap times by almost a second and thats really positive
5446809 unfortunately my physical condition on friday and the rain on saturday meant we didnt head into the race in the best possible shape but im happy because the things weve improved today will be useful for the upcoming races
5446810 it was a good day of testing today after a great day of racing yesterday
5446811 we have collected a lot of information which will help us for the rest of the season
5446812 we will continue with the electronics and mapping tomorrow because we havent finished the whole programme and we also have some general set up work to do then we will leave here in good shape for the final push
5446813 today we concentrated on front tyres and we found some improvement with regards to the wear of the tyre which was one of the biggest problems during the weekend but there is still a lot of work to do
5446814 we tried some different front tyres but we finished after some laps because we couldnt find any improvement
5446815 we tested the tyres with my current race bike because there was no point using the machine with the pneumatic valve engine because the tyres werent working well enough
5446816 today we tested some new steps in development concerning both engine and electronics
5446817 in japan we are working on the development of both the spring valve engine and the pneumatic valve engine and since my last appearance at the italian gp i can say that the bike with pneumatic valve engine has improved a lot
5446818 i think that the bike has reached a satisfactory level of development and i hope that dani will be able to test it soon

5446887 some readers may have inferred from an earlier edition of this story that the federal government keeps a comprehensive record of all prescriptions the drug enforcement agency says it does track prescriptions of so called controlled substances including some mood altering medications but not all prescriptions made in the united states

5446909 hey rich now youre working my side of the street
5446910 if the criminals have access to weapons then so should everyone else
5446911 net result a disproportionate flood of weapons into society which would almost certainly encourage more criminals to arm themselves
5446912 i am highly highly suspicious of a libertarian argument where the pill has been sweetened with statism
5446913 ignoring the abundant problems this country has had with gun crime previously and the demonstrable tendency of illegal handguns to be acquired through straw purchases where legal firearms are available
5446914 there are numerous ways to make a person who feels unsafe feel safer home security tasers dogs street lighting but for some reason firearms have acquired a special status in these discussions
5446915 excuse me whilst i unlock my gun cabinet with ammunition stored safely and separately elsewhere
5446916 its ok for certain people like country squires to own a gun for the reason of sport or for pest control and if they happen to shoot a violent criminal then well begrudgingly allow that but we cant possibly allow the vulnerable to own the effective means of self defence they might gasp shoot someone
5446917 giving people lethal weapons solely to protect themselves from criminals they will in all probability never encounter is lunatic and lethal
5446918 i propose the gradual reintroduction of civilian ownership of firearms for self defence in the uk
5446919 after a successful pilot study firearms and training should be offered more generally to
5446920 lets bring them back in the most civilised way possible
5446921 its ok for certain people like country squires to own a gun for the reason of sport or for pest control and if they happen to shoot a violent criminal then well begrudgingly allow that but we cant possibly allow the vulnerable to own the effective means of self defence they might gasp shoot someone
5446922 that said i have belonged to rifle clubs and teams i have worked on an estate where firearms were used for vermin control i have been clay pigeon shooting
5446923 but to encourage gun ownership to defend oneself against fear which is what youre really saying is and i repeat lunatic
5446924 the bar for weapons ownership should be very high perhaps with many character references and a postgraduate education being needed
5446925 could you lay off stabbing me whilst i get my weapon
5446926 there is nothing ad hominem about saying an idea is lunatic
5446927 but you are suggesting putting guns into the hands of those who you feel can be trusted with them eg postgraduates how patronising can you get
5446928 could you lay off stabbing me whilst i get my weapon
5446929 a global community of friends and strangers answering one simple question what are you doing answer on your phone im or right here on the web
5446930 yes my dream finally came true i had the privilege of seeing andy roddick up close for the very first time since i became a passionate fan of his 5 years ago i look up to him greatly as a tennis player and a human being and it was great to finally see him live in action at the rogers cup
5446931 i really dont know that there are that many people with set hours monday through friday
5446932 but this year im forcing the kids to reuse their backpacks
5446933 they each cost 50 they like the special cool ones and theyre still holding up
5446934 ive got two teenage boys and they like the brand names
5446935 they shant expect that this year were a cheap bunch here at this house anyway
5446936 i think if parents are going to drive their kids to school and not use bus service thats already available that creates problems
5446937 those choices have to be revisited just like everywhere else
5446938 we continue to advise on the criticality of tape encryption but many companies still have yet to implement encryption as part of the backup process because it can add layers of complexity and increase the time required to successfully complete the backup process
5446939 this can impede an organizations ability to back up data in a timely manner and to recover data when its needed for obvious reasons this is unacceptable so we embarked on a significant analysis of methods and technologies and concluded that for companies like ours appliance based encryption is the best solution
5446940 we believe the decru datafort encryption appliance is an excellent choice for encrypting backup tapes without compromising companies disaster recovery plans
5446941 our needs for high performance strong security enterprise wide key management and ease of use are similar to those of other large companies the decru solution stood out as the clear leader in the field and has allowed us to significantly improve the security of our backup process we recommend decru to our customers who face a similar encryption challenge
5446942 storage security has emerged as a high priority in the enterprise and encrypting backup tapes represents an absolute minimum requirement
5446943 we applaud iron mountain for taking a leadership role helping its customers solve this important challenge and for its selection of decru which has very strong credentials in terms of customers partners and technology
5446944 based upon the present state of unacceptable safety compliance of angel tours iguala busmex and de la torre their continued motor carrier operations affiliated with angel tours iguala busmex and or de la torre pose an imminent hazard to public safety

5446956 students need them if they want to get a job somewhere
5446957 no one does laundry as often as they think they will and you just cant run out of the essentials
5446958 a college or university only insures the building not a students personal belongings such as clothes books and electronics so they should be sure they have insurance to cover such things
5446959 students usually bring everything they own and find that once they get here that they do not have enough space for it all
5446960 a student may know more than the average incoming student about the campus but they still wont know it all as policies activities and living arrangements change yearly so be patient ask questions and listen
5446961 freshmen need to understand that the collegiate experience is a wonderful time to meet and interact with people who are different than they are it may be the first time they are asked to communicate their opinion wants and needs to someone else in a constructive way
5446962 being open to new and different ideas can be a little scary at first but the benefit of listening to another perspective will be invaluable in a students development

5446974 we dont carry any inventory and we dont issue any new bonds we connect the buy side to their counterparts thats it
5446975 we think a big advantage in todays market is to provide additional liquidity and we wont be building a short position while selling something long out to our clientele or vice versa
5446976 we also arent putting any capital to use and only match interest based on client needs
5446977 our sweet spot is in the corporate and asset backed space where weve send a majority of our activity
5446978 we have clients spread across the european region and the u s its really a cross border platform and it spans the currencies
5446979 it doesnt really exist in the fixed income space but were trying to get as close we can by matching up client interest off line in an anonymous one to many or one to one basis
5446980 imagine walking back into the warehouse and instead of seeing boxes of cereal and crates of apples you see stacks and stacks of dollar bills hundreds of thousands and millions of freshly minted crisp and crinkly dollar bills just sitting there on pallets piled high to the ceiling thats exactly how you should think of inventory every single case of canned carrots is not just a case of canned carrots its cash and its cash just sitting there useless until you sell that case of canned carrots
5446981 how can anyone make a profit with margins that low
5446982 lets see we need apples mac amp cheese bread milk and a set of patio furniture now off to kroger
5446983 so why do you have them if you only sell five or ten a year
5446984 our students will spend the next four years learning how natural and synthesized chemicals keep our bodies healthy and strong it just makes sense they should do that in a building designed to keep its occupants as healthy as possible as well
5446985 many of todays most effective medications rely on plants and bacteria found in the natural environment so obviously our college of pharmacy and our students have a strong interest in keeping earths environment healthy and sustainable
5446986 all of our new green facilities will not only keep our students healthier and support a future healthier environment but they will also encourage lipscomb students to become more eco friendly in their own lives bike racks are made available to students recycled products in the bookstore they can buy organic or locally grown food hopefully these buildings will serve as an incentive for students to live a green lifestyle while they are on campus
5446987 at lipscomb each day we are striving to purchase mostly local goods and services and reduce carbon outputs while helping our local economy

5447003 this is one of the fundamental things of the olympic games in the vast vast majority of sports there is no attention there is no glamour in the four years leading up to the olympics theres only solitary dedication and in this case not completely solitary but just that handful of your teammates thats who youre in it with and then theres a moment like this those are true olympians right there
5447004 this girl is really really special sometimes in sports its just not going to be your day but you have to get up and you have to be willing to try again and i think thats what makes alicia special

5447008 when he went in we were like all right this is going to be a good race i remember seeing him at the 50 and being like oh my gosh wow i definitely didnt expect alain bernard to be that far ahead i had no idea what to expect it was the final 15 meters when it really got exciting for garrett weber gale and i we were going absolutely crazy behind the blocks
5447009 this is probably about the only race i could really change from this olympics every other one was perfect i definitely dont think i can complain too much it was a world record and a gold medal i did have to deal with a wardrobe malfunction

5447031 according to a model estimate the net effects of climate change in africa could be as high as 133 billion with agriculture bearing the most of the brunt an estimated loss of 132 billion
5447032 the african development bank has established the african fertilizer financing facility afff which is going to be a multi billion dollar facility that will allow african countries to be able to import fertilizers this is important because of the high cost of fertilizers dap in the global market which has increased from 245 as at january last year to 1 600 a tonne now
5447033 demonstrative of a party and a government whose primary concern is their political survival over the competent management of the interests of the state
5447034 it is interesting to note that the celebrated economist mr kwame pianim in an interview with daily graphic stated that ghanas economy needed an injection of 130 million to stay healthy and the sale of 70 per cent of gt shares to vodafone could provide that critical support strengthen the macro economy and control inflation
5447035 this statement has not been denied it was also stated that without this sale ghana telecom would be in critical condition and the workers jobs would be at risk it is interesting that the running mate to nana akufo addo was part of the board that oversaw the decline of ghana telecom to this sorry state
5447036 under the ndc the government of ghana maintained majority shares for the people of this country in ghana telecom recognizing its importance as a strategic national asset
5447037 the ndc is of the view that more could have been realized for the sale of gt fixed line and carrier service one touch mobile service the fibre optic gateway and the exzeed call services

5447042 if the eu wants to play a role in reaching peace it needs open channels of dialogue to tbilisi and to moscow
5447043 calls from some eu member states particularly those in eastern europe to deal harshly with moscow by scrapping talks with russia on a new strategic partnership have put germany in a tricky position germany is heavily dependent on russian energy and remains an advocate of closer european ties with moscow

5447050 crowd was persuaded to disperse and leave and no extreme actions took place
5447051 disputes be resolved peacefully through dialogue so as to achieve regional peace and stability
5447052 rapidly escalated the tension and raised international concerns and public anxiety
5447053 some analysts even showed the concern that military antagonism could evolve into a new version of the cold war
5447054 war is not the way to settle conflicts the only way to effectively resolve disputes is to disregard old grievances cease hostilities and negotiate for peace only in the backdrop of peace and in the framework of constructive negotiation can a win win deal be reached
5447055 an analysis of americas global missile defense system shows that washington is deploying its elements primarily in eastern europe rather than japan or other asian countries or australia this is probably because washington does not want to irritate china which could respond by stepping up the development of its own missile program and increasing the number of intercontinental ballistic missiles on combat duty
5447056 despite its diminished status following the soviet breakup in 1991 russia alone possesses weapons that can destroy the united states a military industrial complex nearly americas equal in exporting arms and the planets largest oil and natural gas reserves it also remains the worlds largest territorial country pivotally situated in the west and the east at the crossroads of colliding civilizations with strategic capabilities from europe iran and other middle east nations to north korea china india afghanistan and even latin america all things considered our national security may depend more on russia than russias does on us
5447057 nabucco was not planned to be an anti russian project but to be a pro european project the main focus is to transport gas from alternate sources

5447072 the first trial was uncalled for in the first place i dont think prosecuting americans for feeding hungry children is something that makes me a proud american however the fact that the first trial ended in a mistrial with most defendants being very close to acquittal showed the government really did not have a case
5447073 the prosecutors have already spent millions of taxpayer money to retry the defendants the defense lawyers on the other hand have been waiting diligently for the fifth circuit to approve its budgets the trial less than two months away and the lawyers have no money to gather witnesses and information this is unfair and simply un american
5447074 in the hlf case we are witnessing a manipulation of the system by those whose hands are on the levers of power from allowing barred evidence to enter jury room deliberations to holding back funding for defendants court appointed lawyers the governments representatives are undermining laws they have sworn to uphold what is supposed to be a level playing field by law is now stacked heavily against the defendants right to a fair trial it is a troubling pattern of behavior
5447075 we are concerned about due process in this country the lack of funding denies defendants the right to present any meaningful defense in this case apparently the system is unable to guarantee defendants constitutional rights the court has a responsibility to provide fair representation for indigent defendants
5447076 advanced ethical extraterrestrial civilizations have been visiting the earth with increased frequency since the dawn of the atomic age due to their concerns over the long term effects of nuclear weapons testing and war
5447077 we need to introduce new technologies to prevent the widespread use of fossil fuels and nuclear energy that are hazardous to the global environment humanity and extraterrestrials
5447078 extensive evidence supports testimony from a number of whistleblowers and contactees
5447079 that some of these extraterrestrial civilizations specifically approached world governments to ask for an end to nuclear weapons development due to dangers yet unknown to our scientists
5447080 global environment all species on the planet and the fabric of time space itself
5447081 current israeli plans to preemptively attack iran with nuclear bunker busting weapons exemplifies the dangers of unrestrained government actions when there is a lack of public awareness of the real risks of such weapons
5447082 one love ta all there may be even more to it than that tho i agree with you i listen to boston talk radio at night before nodding off the weekend guys didnt bring it up as the dynamic is different for them more light weight stuff but thru friday it was hysteria they kept it going just for the interest it attracted the most surreal of all of what i saw was the news conference with the police the presenting officers all had rubber gloves on while one of them slipped one of the lite brite boxes out of a special evidence bag to display to the media its only a lite brite box what did he think was going to happen wtf it leads me to believe all the more they were trying to save face but the more they did the more idiotic they all looked huge waste of money time and resources the real criminals probably had a field day while the cops were all consumed with this nonsense gotta justify that homeland security budget you can bet that the benchmark price for oil and natural gas will take a jump just on the news of the fire the cold weather in the midwest and ne has already given the traders and excuse to drive up the price ericswan said i suppose anything is possible nowak raced from houston to orlando wearing diapers in the car so she wouldnt have to stop to go to the bathroom authorities said
5447083 i also had a feeling that there is more to the story than meets the eye amp the thought crossed my mind that maybe somebody set up the astronaut to completely humiliate and discredit her perhaps she expressed a politically incorrect opinion or she knows something that could range from nasa skullduggery to the reality of alien life she may even have been programmed and drugged to behave as she did

5447089 if anyone cannot feel the power of god when he looks upon the stars then i doubt whether he is capable of feeling at all from the enduring wonder of the heavens flows all grace and power if anyone thinks it is mindless then he himself must be out of his mind
5447090 when the creator had compounded the whole he divided it into as many psyches as there are stars and allotted each psyche a star and the one who lives his appointed time well will travel again to this state and live a blessed life according to his true nature
5447091 a star is the representative generated by each psyche when it enters the cosmos

5447093 chemtrails were used for over the horizon radio communications in the gulf war in 1993
5447094 i saw it on the net so it must be true
5447095 we always prefer to give a positive incentive rather than absolute prohibition so that people can contribute without a lot of hassle
5447096 it was quite honestly my impression that it was well known that i was not who i claimed to be and that in the absence of any confirmation no respectible sic publication would print it
5447097 my wikipedia motto is lux et veritas light and truth and i believe more individuals should contribute with an intention to bring light to the community and truth to the encyclopedia
5447098 its always inappropriate to try to win an argument by flashing your credentials
5447099 the first project is an effort to block the rays of the sun from hitting the earth including the ultra violet radiation that will come through without an adequate layer of ozone in the upper regions above the earth this it is hoped will lower temperature on the surface of the earth and block ultra violet radiation from causing skin cancer in humans the aerosol is probably aluminum oxide or a compound that would have similar properties
5447100 the second and most secretive project is the united states navys rfmp radio frequency mission planner military program the rfmp is the system name given to a group of computer programs and one of the supporting subprograms within the rfmp system is called the vtrpe computer program vtrpe is an acronym that stands for variable terrain radio parabolic equation it is a computer radio frequency propagation program that deals with radio waves and enables the rfmp system to visually see the battlefield terrain in 3 dimensions 3 d on a television screen the rfmp system also depends on satellites to feed their images of the battlefield into the rfmp system to be combined with the battlefield picture painted from the ground thus producing 3 d images
5447101 by providing an extremely interactive and visual television type radar screens environment the radio frequency mission planner rfmp system allows the computer operator to develop familiarity with the
5447102 the vtrpe computer program only worked accurately over water and along coastal areas but not over land masses because the systems radar waves required an atmospheric condition known as
5447103 the third project also utilizes the mixture of barium salts in the atmosphere
5447104 the risks are high but the rewards are worth it
5447105 the fourth project in the atmosphere is the darpa defense advanced research projects agency biological detection and decontamination programs the program also utilizes the mixture of barium salts as the base vehicle in aerosol along with special polymer fibers in the atmosphere they have released biological into the atmosphere in trials testing the detection and decontamination systems
5447106 it is believed that barium salt polymer fibers and other chemicals in the atmosphere are the physical irritants that are either directly or indirectly responsible for the recent epidemic increase in cases of nose bleed asthma allergies pneumonia upper respiratory symptoms and a noticeable increase in arthritis symptoms recently reported nationwide chemicals illegally sprayed into the atmosphere are producing atmospheric and ground conditions detrimental to human and animal health but favorable to the growth of harmful molds and fungus these conditions are not conducive to good health the soluble salts of barium an earth metal are toxic in mammalian systems they are absorbed rapidly from the gastrointestinal tract and are deposited in the muscles lungs and bone no case data is available from the medical community on the long term effects of barium in the human body
5447107 the programs are secret because the federal epa and state environmental quality agencies need to

5447109 the frustrating part for us is that you are posting things that have no explanation at the moment and by themselves make no sense to us blasted said
5447110 it was a successful team effort between the coast guard the navy and the air force
5447111 overall i mean it is tremendous that we were able to get this guy what he needed till the navy got their 60 on the scene
5447112 the navy hoisted the guy up and took him to fishermans hospital
5447113 the areas believed to be composed of liquids are shown in blue as an aid to interpretation
5447114 this all adds up to one thing barbaro is still alive
5447115 we know that barbaro went into the recovery pool jan 28 at 5 40 p m we know he ate corn and oats at 8 10 p m and we are told he was euthanized at 10 30 a m the next morning but what happened during those 15 hours for which we have no records
5447116 i was driving near saratoga springs the other day alone when out of my passenger window i saw barbaro galloping across an open field
5447117 at first i thought i was seeing things but im sure it was him same long face same brown coat same mane tail and everything
5447118 i was at a little eighth mile track outside of bakersfield when a big brown 3 year old won by nine lengths despite a hitch in his gait
5447119 won big too i thought id found the next barbaro but the more i think about it theres no way it was anyone else but barbaro himself
5447120 i saw barbaro in the parking lot at the mall
5447121 he was hiding behind a big car i went to tell my mom but then he was gone
5447122 how are we being led to believe that barbaro who fought so valiantly through all those injuries for eight months suddenly just gave up and allowed himself to be euthanized
5447123 barbaro would never die like that and everybody knows it and its ludicrous to think that we would simply accept that he did
5447124 a surveillance camera at lael stables in west grove pa captured a brief image of a horse entering barbaros childhood stall at midnight on march 5 2007
5447125 the next day there were fresh hoofprints in the mud and the hay had been strewn about he clearly came back for something but what
5447126 my devotee is the god i have come to serve
5447127 you tell me are they real or are they memorex just exactly where does he leave off and you begin this odyssey
5447128 have you a comment to the original posting of geometric forms on the dark side of the moon and in particular the apparent synchronicity of 19 47
5447129 my reason for bringing this to your attention was initialized by the fact that keith seems to be chanelling you or is that vise versa
5447130 just an an aside between me and you it does give your work credibility
5447131 a procession of the damned by the damned i mean the excluded we shall have a procession of data that science has excluded
5447132 i think were property i should say we belong to something that once upon a time this earth was land that other worlds explored and colonized here and fought among themselves for possession but that now its owned by something that something owns this earth all others warned off nothing in our own times perhaps because i am thinking of certain notes i have has ever appeared upon this earth from somewhere else so openly as columbus landed upon san salvador or as hudson sailed up his river but as to surreptitious visits to this earth in recent times or as to emissaries perhaps from other worlds or voyagers who have shown every indication of intent to evade and avoid we shall have data as convincing as our data of oil or coal burning aerial super constructions

5447136 so it might explain why richard perhaps deflected your question to keep sword or the unit out of any more limelight
5447137 gt exactly they were and they did and then the rch line went dead sword carried on for a while and outright complained and bemoaned the fact that he had to play this communication role for which he had said he was not well suited or qualified for obviously being that he in many ways sounded like a sgt rock so there was in numerous places frustration at the circumstance and also about rch choking clamming up hesitating and not fulfilling his role
5447138 o k so the video in thoroughly cryptic ways is telling a story of what transpired previously with regards to hoagland and the pictures yet if you are in contact with richard now in the present then please help me understand why this is so much a revelation
5447139 no doubting you just my query of why a disclosure of high level human covert intelligence events that occurred needs to be so convoluted in its manner are you saying that this embedding and revealing inandof itself is coded into the video from an alien source with richard in the present is thus able to afirm its veracity
5447140 while i have been known for weaving three stories in one i accept that the video ufo diaries is embedding multiple meanings where i get a little lost is where or how the alien communication method ties in
5447141 is the embedded codex method itself in the product called a video in this case ufo diaries the alien communication coming in from a hyperdimensional form or level
5447142 i have always felt and understood that truth arises in everything and that so called fiction nonetheless brings with it truth and wisdom knowledge simply wrapped in the outer story and its basic fictional appearances
5447143 are you driving at the realization of the method itself as the direct manner of reception
5447144 im just trying to sort now for what is the standout from face on mars images and their supression and thus re aquisition the revelation of the images themselves of possibly four distinct faces at different locations is indeed profound by itself the spy vs spy stuff is just history telling now glad rch made it through all of that
5447145 did the director you mentioned behind the videos know what he was apart of or is this a phenomenon that has appeared through his work to be now recognized by one capable like you
5447146 this may be poorly worded i am grokking the basics of your work and have read well up to page 14 html just a few niggling confusions trying to grok this all together into an understanding hope these question make some sense

5447182 none of them are a statement that i would be comfortable making right now at this point in my life they all served their purpose and in that respect im proud of all of them
5447183 but as something that feels artistically in keeping with who i am today i think that they are inevitably going to fall short of that as time goes on i mean they just dont continue to mean the same things to me and a new record is kind of where its at

5447204 the rudras are chiefly 11 and exist in the 3 worlds of cosmic solar and planetary
5447205 eleven are the rudras and thrice eleven they are hence the number is thirty three
5447206 a human mission to a neo and the associated robotic probes will return a lot of science and this will be valuable but as a lifelong resident of earth i think that being prepared to save the planet ranks higher on the priority list than insights into the formation of the solar system but we can do both
5447207 our species hasnt been around long enough to have experienced a cataclysmic extinction event but they will occur again whether we are ready for them or not
5447208 human expansion into our solar system is fundamentally about the survival of the species about ensuring better odds for our survival through the promulgation of our species
5447209 but one assumption that i know will be justified is that the moon the near earth asteroids and the rest of the solar system contain the resources that will take mankind to the next level of civilization and prosperity i dont know when it will occur or who will do it but it will happen i hope that it will be soon and that we will be the agents of this great endeavor
5447210 the clich that we should land on one or more asteroids because they are there certainly applies since the need to explore is an ancient and deeply held human trait
5447211 but more pragmatically knowledge is never wasted so there will be things to learn from being on asteroids that we cannot anticipate but that can only be beneficial
5447212 but far more important it will teach us valuable things about them and the need to spread the human seed not only for adventure but as a hedge against a civilization threatening catastrophe on the home planet
5447213 one of the issues that you have is that theres probably some variability asteroid to asteroid
5447214 i think its becoming more of a credible issue now people recognize that these kinds of events can happen and we actually have the capability now to do something about it
5447215 the space community and i would include the political community is beginning to take this more seriously weve progressed a long way over the last few years but we still have a long way to go
5447216 yet another calculated deception of the american public can be traced to the johnson administration in 1966 the u s department of state produced a beautiful extravagantly illustrated brochure of american hand tools this was printed in russian for distribution in russia with a preface in russian by lyndon johnson requests to the state department for a copy of this brochure went unanswered the book is not listed in official catalogues of government publications it is not available or even known to the general public no printers name appears on the back cover the publisher is not listed the author obtained a copy from russia

5447225 we recently celebrated our 5 year anniversary of doing business in ukraine a great accomplishment for our company and employees and we wanted to honor that success by giving back the community
5447226 thinking beyond our own backyard we decided to assist organizations that are helping children improve their lives for they are our future we hope to help make a difference by continuing to be a good corporate citizen
5447227 we fell in love with the children and decided to stay in india to continue to give our help with our team composed of french volunteers who came when the tsunami hit and scores of local residents every day we help people to the best of our ability
5447228 i lost my entire family to the tsunami wave everyone here is gone today i had the opportunity to meet the scientology volunteer ministers when they came to my village to help us they gave me a scientology assist i could feel my mind become calmer bit by bit i was able to find myself and once again began to think of the fututre in the end i once again wanted to live i am going to train to help my friends and neighbors as the volunteer ministers helped me
5447229 i am very happy with the terrific seminar and unique course of education called the technology of study based on the works of l ron hubbard i am certain this course will help me learn more and share my experiences with my students friends and others of good will i hope that you will continue to serve humanity and share your knowledge skill and experience with present and future generations may god bless your work
5447230 they fuel sexual abuse violent crime perpetuate war and perhaps most importantly destroy individual lives its a problem we all face whether directly or indirectly and if we all work in the same direction we can do something about it
5447231 determination and imagination in searching for new approaches to improve the performance of the public sector
5447232 when the curtain came down exposing the fragile state of the world scientologists everywhere heard their wake up call
5447233 if one does not like the crime cruelty injustice and violence of this society he can do something about it he can become a volunteer minister and help civilize it bring it conscience and kindness and love and freedom from travail by instilling into it trust decency honesty and tolerance
5447234 we were helping hundreds of people daily with what l ron hubbard developed and seeing the results instantly how fantastic is that
5447235 when you started to help that person he would start crying see how hopeless his life was and then thanks to the simplicity of the technology he would get better and better to a point where he smiled realized his losses were part of yesterday and that life can and must continue from this point forward
5447236 every day when we would arrive at the shelters more and more people would come up to us and hug us and make us feel welcome
5447237 these people made me feel like i was a lifesaver i was so happy to help them
5447238 this course should be recommended to everybody to do in order to be able to identify his purpose in life and see beyond himself and affect all other things in life
5447239 this course has helped me so much as a pastor
5447240 it has also opened my mind and my view on the world has changed really knowledge is power
5447241 it is great to learn how to assist people who are in pain and in a coma or to make drunken people sober
5447242 this course of assists has given me the opportunity to feel like the person i am today i have never felt so relieved

5447264 i never knew where to get a rag to clean it up
5447265 ok ik zal ditzelfde absoluut niet nog eens doen het is nu tijd om serieus te worden
5447266 ik vraag je om uit het niets te voorschijn te komen en me de schrik van mijn leven te bezorgen als ik ooit weer die kant opga je bezorgt me een diepe angst die me in leven houdt en me ervan weerhoudt om steeds weer deze negatieve manier van sterven te ervaren

5447269 we did everything from disinfecting the locker rooms the showers the training rooms and we still had it but once we disinfected the synthetic turf we pretty much got rid of it
5447270 we had six guys infected with it and they passed it on and passed it on we dealt with it the entire season
5447271 we will attach an economic reward to it that seldom has anything to do with what has been learned
5447272 we no longer believe we can integrate take two ahead of the important holiday season
5447273 turkey keeps international law but as long as there isnt been any final decision over the warrant or any unambiguous mandate we see no need to act

5447275 de belangrijkste hinderpaal op de weg naar de democratie in pakistan is verwijderd
5447276 at one point the driver was told to stop the vehicle when he did he was pulled from the front seat put in the rear seat the victim was then assaulted several times when police located the victim he had injuries to his face and arms
5447277 one of the suspects was arrested and will be appearing in court monday facing charges of robbery assault with a weapon assault causing bodily harm forcible confinement and breach of probation order the second suspect is facing charges of robbery assault causing bodily harm and forcible confinement
5447278 someone could have up to three dogs up to three cats and up to three others be it rabbits lizards or other if they want more than three of any one type of animal they would have to apply for a permit
5447279 existing pets would be grandfathered in we arent going to make anyone give up their pets for adoption if the bylaw gets passed
5447280 its been extreme the different points of view weve received one man who called was totally against it and another said the bylaw doesnt go far enough
5447281 he followed the vehicle some 15 kilometres and then attacked it with a pitch fork causing some 1400 damage to the cab the victim locked himself in the truck and called 9 1 1 as the damage was being inflicted
5447282 the past two weekends unknown persons have thrown what appears to be a molotov cocktail against the wall of mission hill elementary school
5447283 what about the rights of victims and law abiding citizens
5447284 we have decided from now on to stress the rehabilitation of individuals rather than the protection of society
5447285 i can hardly get started seems like there are so many problems to address i cant decide which one to go with
5447286 so why dont you just write about what a beautiful constituency we have and what an incredible province we live in
5447287 im the local bus driver in town and wanted to invite you to hop aboard some time and cruise the route with me figured youd enjoy it
5447288 just wanted you to know we dont have much money
5447289 as i was passing a pickup truck in the other lane a dog riding in the back jumped out of the vehicle it was tied to the truck with a long length of chain
5447290 it was just awful i turned around to help the owners but the dog was covered in blood he was limp and lifeless when i got to them the owners were in shock one of them called 911 because the owners didnt know what else to do i gave them the number and directions for a local vet but i dont know what happened after that
5447291 this poor animal his chain was too long he had too much mobility in the back of the truck and he took advantage of it there are proper ways to secure a dog the best being having them ride inside the vehicle with a pet restraint or a secured crate if they are travelling in the back of a truck
5447292 for the most part people just dont realize how to secure their dog properly they think any length of chain or rope is fine because thats how theyve always done it i feel so bad for the family of this dog they were well meaning by using a chain to secure it they didnt mean for this happen they did have him restricted but it just wasnt enough
5447293 there is a fine of 109 under the motor vehicle act for failure to properly secure an animal while in transport but i dont think a lot of people know that
5447294 most of the calls we get about dogs in cars are to do with them trapped in vehicles on hot days people are starting to call in more and more about that because they are becoming familiar with the bylaw
5447295 its really motivated me to organize some educational clinics on pet safety in a blink of eye people can lose their pet if they dont know how to properly secure them id like to help make them aware of how to do that
5447296 to make matters worse lightning has impacted some of our computer systems meaning crews have to manually check each substation to assess damage
5447297 weve created a consultation process to ensure that all who wish to participate will have an opportunity to do so in as meaningful and convenient a manner as possible
5447298 we are hoping the feedback will be as comprehensive and representative of the community as possible
5447299 there is clear direction of the need to implement further development guidelines regarding water conservation energy efficiency hill side development and environmentally sensitive land areas
5447300 we are now seeking public feedback to guide development of additional policies
5447301 to develop an effective approach to informing young women about this risk factor for breast cancer we need a better understanding of young women
5447302 as part of a study funded by the canadian breast cancer research alliance we are consulting young women age 15 to 24 from across the country on this topic to do this we have been conducting focus groups and are implementing an online survey to reach other women
5447303 the locations were chosen because of the provinces different smoking rates b c has the lowest provincial prevalence rate for smoking 15 per cent with new brunswick among the provinces with the highest rates 22 per cent the web based survey is intended to build on the knowledge gathered through focus groups by reaching out to a wider audience of young women the results of the survey will be used to prepare for a larger national study
5447304 sienna is planning to visit her stepmum kelly hoppen and her sister there she has also invited balthazar to join them
5447305 you go to war with the enemy youve got not the enemy you wish you had
5447306 okay im as lapsed as catholics get but im somewhat familiar with what prayer is and isnt for
5447307 storm restoration firm specializing in residential home repair from the effects of wind and hail damage
5447308 there are no roads in this part of the slum to get to the school we had to leave our car and walk for about a kilometer through areas of incredible poverty the conditions in which these people live is a very gross violation of basic human rights
5447309 the school goes up to grade three and there are 106 kids the day we went there were 96 children there one of the reasons the kids come to school at all is that they are fed at least breakfast and lunch each day and its very commendable for elisha and her team that they arrange this
5447310 the first thing i did with the children was a locational processing assist this is described in the scientology handbook as follows
5447311 l ron hubbard developed numerous applications of his discoveries for the mental and spiritual aspects of a persons physical difficulties and as more and more techniques evolved a new body of technology came into use called assists
5447312 one of the easiest assists to render is locational processing a locational is done by directing a persons attention off the painful area of his body or his difficulties and out onto the environment
5447313 after the locational the kids were really interested in their environment and extroverted the head teacher decided she wanted to learn how to use this technique and use it with the kids in the future as she noticed how much happier the children were
5447314 then using a mixture of english swahili and the local language so everyone could understand i told them about study tech technology developed by l ron hubbard based on research into what prevents a person from being able to learn any subject the teachers were very enthusiastic about what they learned
5447315 thanks for your acknowledgement for the work we are doing within the slums of kibera
5447316 i believe you understand what it takes to have pretty healthy children in a school the feeding program in the school is just another blessing for them though very very expensive especially at this time when the food prices have gone so high
5447317 thanks for the scientology team for the recent childrens seminar the teachers and committee members were happy too looking forward to working together with you for the good of tomorrows civilization the children
5447318 scientology founder l ron hubbard once wrote ideas and not battles mark the forward progress of mankind individuals and not masses form the culture of the race and the city of philadelphia represents some of the most important ideas that shape our culture today
5447319 all men of whatever race color or creed were created with equal rights
5447320 with this donation and several others from local area businesses and individuals we are on our way
5447321 if one does not like the crime cruelty injustice and violence of this society he can do something about it he can become a volunteer minister and help civilize it bring it conscience and kindness and love and freedom from travail by instilling into it trust decency honesty and tolerance
5447322 i have learned a lot about how you can study and go about it easily without any problems
5447323 in order for someone to understand what he or she is teaching or studying he has to follow the right steps as in the technology of study as a teacher you can identify or know if your pupils are getting what you are teaching them by carefully looking at them and identifying their problems
5447324 to study in order to know and apply and not just for passing exams
5447325 i have learned a lot of things like the three major barriers to study i should admit that if all of us had the right approach to study there will be a lot of difference and everyone would approach study with a positive mind
5447326 i have benefited in this workshop especially on how to help pupils have meaningful study during their learning process
5447327 the workshop has been very helpful its amazing how many things we overlook though small have a great influence on our study areas
5447328 i was always involved in educating the children of india
5447329 but when i was introduced to the study technology of l ron hubbard i then had tools that helped the kids to better retain their education tools that assisted the children who were slow in their study and tools that gave educators a technology to teach students how to learn this technology provides an understanding of the basics of learning and supplies exact ways to overcome the pitfalls one can encounter during study
5447330 i agree with what l ron hubbard wrote on the subject of education the end and goal of any society as it addresses the problem of education is to raise the ability the initiative and the cultural level and with all of that the survival level of that society
5447331 drugs are a serious community problem youth see and deal with daily
5447332 our youth need help and nothing talks like experience and mutual respect they all learned a lot about issues that matter to them and you can bet theyre telling their friends all about it
5447333 a well known lifelong liberal activist and supporter of democratic candidates and use of his song and his voice in a commercial bashing barack obama is anathema to jackson
5447334 i grant that youve seen a lot of evidence that i havent but heres my question for you if i saw and read everything that youve seen and read what would i conclude
5447335 fascism is a set of ideologies and practices that seeks to place the nation defined in exclusive biological cultural and or historical terms above all other sources of loyalty and to create a mobilized national community fascist nationalism is reactionary in that it entails implacable hostility to socialism and feminism for they are seen as prioritizing class or gender rather than nation this is why fascism is a movement of the extreme right fascism is also a movement of the radical right because the defeat of socialism and feminism and the creation of the mobilized nation are held to depend upon the advent to power of a new elite acting in the name of the people headed by a charismatic leader and embodied in a mass militarized party fascists are pushed towards conservatism by common hatred of socialism and feminism but are prepared to override conservative interests family property religion the universities the civil service where the interests of the nation are considered to require it fascist radicalism also derives from a desire to assuage discontent by accepting specific demands of the labour and womens movements so long as these demands accord with the national priority fascists seek to ensure the harmonization of workers and womens interests with those of the nation by mobilizing them within special sections of the party and or within a corporate system access to these organizations and to the benefits they confer upon members depends on the individuals national political and or racial characteristics all aspects of fascist policy are suffused with ultranationalism
5447336 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
5447337 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
5447338 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
5447339 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
5447340 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
5447341 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
5447342 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
5447343 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
5447344 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
5447345 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
5447346 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
5447347 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
5447348 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
5447349 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
5447350 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
5447351 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
5447352 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
5447353 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
5447354 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
5447355 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
5447356 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
5447357 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
5447358 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
5447359 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
5447360 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
5447361 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
5447362 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
5447363 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
5447364 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
5447365 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
5447366 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
5447367 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
5447368 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
5447369 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness
5447370 despite an increasingly difficult enterprise spending environment in the u s and parts of europe reasonable growth expectations strength in emerging countries currency and product cycles should be enough to drive some upside for each company
5447371 theyre very high growth economies but theyre still subject to volatility
5447372 i think chinas just kind of a who knows its so hot it has to come down eventually
5447373 youre going to hear notebooks doing well for both companies
5447374 i think that hp continues to be very upbeat about what it can do with eds and will go to great lengths on the conference call to convince people of that
5447375 share gains on the inkjet side combined with stronger emerging market growth on the laser side should drive another quarter of mid single digit revenue growth in printers and operating margin above 15 percent
5447376 even against a tough comparison we expect hp to maintain double digit pc revenue growth on strength outside of the u s
5447377 if it does continue to strengthen you could see some of that be a headwind to top line growth
5447378 office roundup s4 dvd news s5 promos galore and a match made in heaven
5447379 thats like complaining that you have too much ice cream or too many hundred dollar bills in your wallet
5447380 you do know he was a butcher of the worst variety right
5447381 the ecstasy dealer who lives at the end of the block
5447382 i wear the t shirt because i admire obamas forthright and genuine rhetoric he is just cut from a different cloth from most politicians
5447383 he has a new way of dealing with other countries without looking only at american self interest this is something quite revolutionary
5447384 hes not as extreme as most young people but he is a bridge to more radical views
5447385 i saw obama on television saying that you dont necessarily need experience if you have belief and that sometimes experience can cloud your vision
5447386 so that im not so that any blind spots i have or predispositions that i have that my assumptions are challenged and i think that thats an extraordinary important
5447387 still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so fucking smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie
5447388 my whole thing is that that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie i loved the prestige but didnt understand the dark knight
5447389 you know youre never too old to burn your bridges because i believe i have offended everyone i think ive got a couple more
5447390 oh everyone knows hes a drug ridden crazy fool you cant blame him for his behavior
5447391 i have a really interesting political point of view and its not always something i say too loud at dinner tables here but you cant go from a 2 000 a night suite at la mirage to a penitentiary and really understand it and come out a liberal you cant i wouldnt wish that experience on anyone else but it was very very very educational for me and has informed my proclivities and politics every since
5447392 ill drive off that bridge when i come to it
5447393 let me clarify this yet again this is my position as we know it right now i do not support the clubbing of botched aborted babies but if you want to throw them into a trash compactor i have no problem with that as it has been john mccains and dick lugars position for years and we have worked in a bipartisan manner for this
5447394 thank you for standing in the way of those who brought destruction and death to the people of the republic
5447395 you were the last hope of innocent people and your bravery saved lives
5447396 i am sure that such a well done effective and peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military
5447397 the soldiers told us they had an order from putin leave or be killed
5447398 they said putin has given us an order that everyone must be either shot or forced to leave they told us we should ask the americans for help now because they would kill us if we stayed
5447399 heres a young girl orphaned and made homeless by indiscriminate shelling by georgians
5447400 heres another typical ossetian who says that georgians make pastry using the blood of south ossetians
5447401 two years without open air and sunlight on begged food because the russian immigration office doesnt give food to africans
5447402 whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5447403 you know who really has to worry about obama and white women andrea mitchells husband alan greenspan
5447404 frankly warren as president i do not think it is my place to render an opinion on that since it is a moral question upon which many disagree however as a constitutional scholar i support roe vs wade and i do believe the government has a say in the legality of abortion
5447405 obama sucked but mccain was good so obviously mccain cheated and obtw we have no proof of that
5447406 i worked in the illinois legislature to make sure we were providing child care and health care and other support services for the women who had who were going to be kicked off the rolls after certain time

5447418 if one is going to find fault with something it implies that he wishes to do something about it and would if he could if one does not like the crime cruelty injustice and violence of this society he can do something about it he can become a volunteer minister and help civilize it bring it conscience and kindness and love and freedom from travail by instilling into it trust decency honesty and tolerance
5447419 i have noticed that a calm has come to me i have been less reactive i rarely use foul language which before would roll off my tongue if one slips i am more aware of it now before i would not even stop myself when i was aware of it
5447420 what i learned is that a marriage must be created not just once but every day every second you are around each other that communication and trust is the principal tools to use in creating this lasting partnership the main success i got from this was applying it to my own marriage
5447421 it has reinstated such important principles as how to handle and raise a child to help him or her achieve full potential i now give my students more freedom allow each of them to grow as their own individual person and not so much just a stationary kid who only does and knows what society expects him or her to do
5447422 i was able to successfully resolve two conflicts one in my hood and the other at a party
5447423 i was glad to put what i have learnt into practice and it did work out perfectly
5447424 i found that my children are best responsive when given an option in life and that through support and help and listening to what they have to say it has made them happier i have found this to be a fantastic way of seeing my children almost always happy they have gone through a traumatic experience this has been the most relevant thing i have done with my children and i have learned that by letting them choose it opens up a new happiness for us all i personally still struggle that they are not with me all of the time but the times they are with me they are a pleasure to be with
5447425 i am more capable of establishing bonds with other people and overcoming past hurts
5447426 in the past i only had a superficial relationship with my sister
5447427 i have been able to reach out to her and to reestablish close bonds with her and her family
5447428 i really learned to be a better person with this course
5447429 using the lessons to better my study and retention skills
5447430 i am happier now than i have been in many years thanks to learning what i have learned here
5447431 theres just too many children who are dying of cancer and especially brain tumors that we need to do something and research is the only way well ever be able to get anywhere

5447433 everyday trying to make a difference trying to get people to join our team

5447435 and we have never received so many thank you letters one of the local mayors thanked for us repeatedly for our work it was a joy to help these children with the drug ed lectures
5447436 if one does not like the crime cruelty injustice and violence of this society he can do something about it he can become a volunteer minister and help civilize it bring it conscience and kindness and love and freedom from travail by instilling into it trust decency honesty and tolerance

5447646 the governors issuance of the executive order and him filing the lawsuit puts california on a very dangerous course under federal law we have to pay the correct wages if we fail to pay the correct wages we are subject to penalties that are two or three times what we originally owe
5447647 it is getting critical to where time now becomes more of an issue for just the physical part of getting ready for the opener

5447671 we are very disappointed with the courts ruling and are considering our appeal options
5447672 the ruling has the potential to mandate a badly flawed scheme for calculating the prevailing rate that could result in inflated rates and higher repair costs abari wants to circumvent the role of competition in setting prices and force insurers to pay whatever amount is reported to them in the auto body labor rate survey we want to make sound decisions about repair claims and take into account the many factors that should be included in determining a fair labor rate efforts to make sure repair costs are reasonable benefit all consumers because they help contain the cost of auto insurance
5447673 this acquisition will provide us with a new market entry into the california retail oriented recycled parts market and additional capacity to grow our southern california wholesale recycling business
5447674 during our evaluation of pick your part we were very impressed by its operations and employees and are excited to have this opportunity to add them to lkq corporations business
5447675 the rules have to apply to insurers and that limits how we craft the prohibitions
5447676 the cra doesnt want surveys used in a way that will create average rates that fail to reflect the ingredients of quality repair work we think the commissioner understands that not all shops are equal and that averages are not standards
5447677 the survey should not contain shop labor rates that have not somehow been verified and justified as being reasonable

5447681 here is the bug here is the fix update the driver
5447682 the perception of jobs that he designs products in the middle of the night and builds them during the day has served apple well
5447683 people look at steve jobs in a lot of different ways being a good ceo being a good innovator being the messiah most of those perceptions are hard to shake
5447684 this is about one person giving a focused message and he delivers it very well
5447685 there are very few people that can deliver a message like steve other ceos only wish they had a fraction of the charisma that steve has
5447686 apple gets appointed as some kind of a poster child for that
5447687 but its not that far off from the normal culture
5447688 its a cultural style issue thats been in apples dna almost from the companys beginning
5447689 in almost every case even with john sculley michael spindler gil amelio apple ceos emerge as the company face and the public image
5447690 apples an 18 billion company it didnt get there because of one man
5447691 whoever leads the company is going to have to be part of the apple culture you cant come in and learn it
5447692 to that degree steves doing a great job of building that cultural acclimation into his leadership staff if wall street truly understood that the company is driven by both vision and execution any impact from a future jobs departure will be minimized

5447702 why didnt xyz happen in history or whats its cause
5447703 is problem such that certain percentage of lispers ask these questions or get confused by these
5447704 oh what a question i dont know really but high enough as it seems
5447705 well me if i were you i hadnt asked a question like this but did a meaningful test with the candidate
5447706 is gt problem such that certain percentage of lispers ask these questions or get gt confused by these

5447716 from 1973 to 1990 the united states sold saddam hussein more than a quarter of his weapons
5447717 i would not have nominated clarence thomas i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of a lot of the constitution
5447718 though he assured the audience that at least they were smart enough for the job
5447719 so lets see by the time he was nominated clarence thomas had worked in the missouri attorney generals office served as an assistant secretary of education run the equal employment opportunity commission and sat for a year on the d c circuit court of appeals the nations second most prominent court
5447720 isnt yet four years out of the illinois state senate has never held a hearing of note with his u s senate subcommittee and had an unremarkable record as both a community organizer and law school lecturer
5447721 evidence that suggests to many that the shroud is older than the radiocarbon dates allow and so further research is certainly needed
5447722 only by doing this will people be able to arrive at a coherent history of the shroud which takes into account and explains all of the available scientific and historical information
5447723 had other ideas but theyve all been shot down and this one will be shot down too
5447724 i am really happy and honored that fitz motorsports has chosen me as their driver for these races
5447725 to run in the nationwide series is a new challenge for me and also an excellent path for my career as a nascar driver
5447726 i am more than ready to take this on and i will give it everything ive got to position myself as a contender in this series
5447727 the cc gold coast builds upon the luxury sports coupe that debuted at the 2008 north american international auto show
5447728 weve added luxury and performance extras like tri coat paint high end interior appointments and ground affects that enhance the sportiness of our newest sedan
5447729 any racer who watches the truck series says man that looks like a lot of fun and i wish i could do that
5447730 this gives me a chance to log some laps at bristol as well ive never raced at bristol so any seat time is priceless hopefully we can learn a lot and have some fun
5447731 when we brought steve in we really took a look and he wasnt where we thought we needed to have him at this point so we need to move on
5447732 some guys have been released at other places and people are picking them up youd like to pick up some of those guys and bring them in because theyve been in other camps and push some of our guys unfortunately there are some guys right now on our roster that are borderline guys that as of today would make it just because we dont have anybody else
5447733 when guys are in the training room theyre not out here practicing youve got to be willing to release them and live with it and pick other people up for more competition

5447779 view not long ago the women debated wheither or not the earth was flat
5447780 between the two of us it is our belief and to the best of our knowledge that no prisoner was beaten or harmed physically in that camp the plantation my only contention with the mccain deal is that while he was at the plantation to the best of my knowledge and teds he was not physically abused in any way no one was in that camp it was the camp that people were released from
5447781 no man witnessed another man during interrogations we relied on each other to tell the truth when a man was returned to his cell
5447782 and their parents are as likely to believe in flying saucers as in evolution
5447783 liberal arts degree ha i like my fries extra crispy and piping hot
5447784 the fact is that i have agreed with president bush far more than i have disagreed and on the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush so have we had some disagreements on some issues particularly domestic issues yes but i will argue my conservative record voting with anyones and i will also submit that my support for president bush has been active and very impassioned on issues that are important to the american people and im particularly talking about the war on terror the war in iraq national security national defense support of men and women in the military fiscal discipline a number of other issues so i strongly disagree with any assertion that ive been more at odds with the president of the united states than i have been in agreement with him
5447785 willful ignoramuses ensuring that their children will also be ignoramuses
5447786 mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused
5447787 had the easier task in the back to back interviews before about 2 800 members of the evangelical church in lake forest he drew frequent applause with crisp answers intended to reinforce his conservative credentials
5447788 mccain an episcopalian who attends a baptist church in phoenix has frequently been criticized by evangelical leaders for failing to speak as openly about his faith as obama and for relying on well worn stories about how he found god as a prisoner of war in vietnam he did not diverge from that practice saturday night
5447789 mccain immediately responded that a babys rights begin at conception
5447790 religious bondage shackles and debilitates the mind and unfits it for every noble enterprise every expanded prospect
5447791 history furnishes no example of a priest ridden people maintaining a free civil government this marks the lowest grade of ignorance of which their civil as well as religious leaders will always avail themselves for their own purposes
5447792 do nancy pelosi and howard dean really think that when the nsa is listening in on terrorists planning attacks on america they need to hang up when those terrorists dial their sleeper cells in the united states
5447793 my psyche and mentality is pretty much fixed on im the greatest race car driver that ever lived know what im saying
5447794 if you dont think that thats what david pearson told me you dont belong in a race car
5447795 what it helps with is points im sure kyle feels the same way its just that when we beat him its a 20 point spread and it goes the other way i finished second to him a few times this year and thats frustrating
5447796 when the democrats took control of congress in 2007 and oil was 50 a barrel and corn 2 a bushel house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader harry reid promised an energy plan were still waiting for it today crude oil is 134 and corn is 6 50 its pretty clear whos to blame congress in fact house and senate democrats have obstructed any progress in america s fight to regain some semblance of energy independence

5447798 we have the statistics all the time and theyre posted downstairs it gets hard if one quarterback all through spring and all through summer camp was statistically better in almost every single category its hard to rationalize not making him the starter not only documenting that every day after practice but having all that documentation to make sure because your gut feeling is one thing and the statistics are another we have to make sure were being credible with the information

5447800 oh my gosh shes like straightedge straightedge kids are like so stuck up such a dork hehehe
5447801 you know if youve got book sales of 25 million
5447802 now these things are all relative and im not suggesting that everybody that is making over 250 000 is living on easy street but the question that i think we have to ask ourselves is if we believe in good schools if we believe in good roads if we want to make sure that kids can go to college if we dont want to leave a mountain of debt for the next generation then weve got to pay for these things they dont come for free
5447803 create a sense of balance and fairness in our tax code
5447804 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
5447805 so i think if youre just talking about income how about 5 million
5447806 and you know we laugh about it but we cry and we should cry because the congress is supposed to be careful stewards of your tax dollars so what did they just do in the middle of an energy crisis when in california we are paying 4 a gallon for gas went on vacation for five weeks i guarantee you two things they never miss a pay raise and a vacation and we should stop that and call them back and not raise your taxes we should not and cannot raise taxes in tough economic times so it doesnt matter really what my definition of rich is because i dont want to raise anybodys taxes

5447820 it was a great way to start off the week
5447821 its always great to meet so many of our fans
5447822 camp apollo once again would like to thank the new york islanders for their continued support in making our carnival day an enormous success
5447823 the campers were thrilled to take pictures with sparky hang out and play hockey with andy hilbert and play on the inflatable games
5447824 it was a lot of fun playing hockey with the player and getting cool sticks
5447825 at georgetown i was elected as a captain my senior year so learning how to take charge was important
5447826 im not really a loud person i dont talk too much but stepping into that role learning how to address issues has helped me grow as a player and a leader i learned a lot from the coaches about defense in general not just my position
5447827 but you play some games where you have a lot of fans and other games in some smaller cities where they just dont have the money for the most part the playoff games and the championship game had pretty big crowds
5447828 in italy usually its about five or six americans per team in germany maybe eight or 10 but the rest is made up of local players
5447829 coming from the states football is a whole lot bigger and they dont get the coaching overseas that we get in learning the techniques you have to help your teammates as best as you can because anything you can help them learn makes the team better

5447859 no music critic in the world would ever complain that an album of three minute pop singles somehow did not measure up to kind of blue or sergeant pepper
5447860 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama

5447932 watching the behaviour of young israeli soldiers towards an elderly palestinian man on my first day in jerusalem at a checkpoint felt very familiar
5447933 id seen this in south africa where i grew up
5447934 ive always been a doctor interested in human rights and wider questions and you could say that doctors have as much a responsibility to speak out about the social and political causes of distress and disease as they have to treat the individual patients
5447935 in a bad state though not remotely as bad as it is now
5447936 i was in gaza on the day the so called peace process was signed in oslo in august 1993 and it was very interesting because most of the people i knew there were incredibly happy they thought it was the end of it all but a minority of palestinians said and they turned out to be right this wasnt a deal and were pessimistic and that yasser arafat didnt know what he was signing
5447937 the most awful crime has been played out down there by a colonial power that considered itself part of europe they were grabbing palestinians land and torturing them in ways that were reminiscent of south africa but as it turns out far far worse than south africa
5447938 much more openly brutal and the major powers didnt say anything
5447939 when before they went on a raid the israeli defence board used to discuss how it would look in europe and the us they dont bother with that any more so clearly torture was a major question there
5447940 basically spent some time in israeli detention some of them for years
5447941 all of which pointed to consistent torture as state policy in israel and the appalling use of indiscriminate fire power against children who throw stones
5447942 close range by snipers a single bullet to the head or neck
5447943 they should not condone or be present during torture and they should speak out if they come across it
5447944 the israeli medical association is a signatory to these declarations yet it became clear that it was in complete complicity in the war crimes committed by the israeli state
5447945 more unarmed palestinian civilians since september 2000 than the number of people who died on 11 september 2001
5447946 i dont cite my opinion i quote international rights groups and un bodies the facts are there already
5447947 im called that all the time it doesnt inhibit me if anything it encourages me because it means im getting through to them so they make a fight but the point about a fight is that it creates more publicity and its conscientising it wakes up people one way or the other and part of the story here is when is the doctor a doctor that is to say its a humanitarian profession supposedly it has a moral authority in a society healing people regardless of politics and when is a doctor a citizen this is another matter altogether and what ive discovered is that at the end of the day israeli doctors have made it clear their loyalty is to israeli citizenship and if israel says they must torture palestinians and shoot children in the street then those doctors will do their best to cover it up or make it sound ok to put a nice face on it theyre putting a nice face on the occupation
5447948 which makes the question are you a citizen or a doctor more poignant
5447949 the head of the ima who is in charge of medical ethics knows that doctors have a duty to speak out against torture but he said to them come on whats a couple of broken fingers when you interrogate a palestinian man for the information we can get
5447950 these are academics so they have a certain public status
5447951 of course its difficult to run it and there are tremendous pressures but were optimistic
5447952 brings out whats happening and the point is the collusion of the academic establishment in israel not one israeli university protested when palestinian universities were shut berzeit university was shut for three years at one point students are shot at check points they cant get to lectures doctors cant get to see patients nothing some israeli universities are now founded on palestinian land stolen land academia especially medical academia is in complete collusion with the colonial expansionist state
5447953 we try to get aid in to gaza teach in universities in palestine and we give palestinian students places to study in britain
5447954 an israeli doctor will applaud me and buy me a drink if i write about sudan guatemala or china if i were to cross out israel and put sudan that would be great but because i say its israel they say to me youre a pro terrorist propagandist or they call me nazi in psychology we say we have many rooms in our head and one has to ask which one are you in and speaking from in some of our rooms we dont behave the same the fact is that ive been consistently bold on israel and they tell me there must be some weird reason why i am an anti semite
5447955 support for israel is embedded in western systems without doubt the us and the uk regard israel as a european country israel continues to play the holocaust story and anti semitism as a way of blocking the truth
5447956 its a much harder struggle than the struggle against apartheid so none of us fools ourselves but i think weve had some modest effects and i think they continue israel certainly has taken them extremely seriously every time an israeli cabinet minister comes to london the first thing he wants to talk about is the boycott what they fear is the rhetorical power that these things echo thats what theyre afraid of
5447957 ultimately what would be effective would be not buying israeli goods and trying to get companies to take their investments out of israeli linked companies
5447958 of course its terribly slow and of course most people are not political
5447959 clearly we have to influence the politicians but out of 550 mps in britain more than 200 were drawn in as friends of israel and their concern is to block these things to hide it it is extraordinary how strong the lobby is
5447960 do you realise you have more power to do good in the world if three or four jewish professors who have connections with the ima say that involvement of israeli doctors in interrogation rooms has to stop the torture will have to stop because then shabak the general security services wouldnt be able to proceed in their usual way i tell them that not doing this is moral corruption

5448006 dependability can be engineered and built into equipment but effective maintenance is required to keep it dependable experience shows that equipment lasts longer and performs better when covered by an epm electrical preventative maintenance program
5448007 infrared inspections of electrical systems are beneficial to reduce the number of costly and catastrophic equipment failures and unscheduled plant shutdowns
5448008 routine infrared inspections of energized electrical systems should be performed annually prior to shutdown more frequent infrared inspections for example quarterly or semiannually should be performed where warranted by loss experience installation of new electrical equipment or changes in environmental operational or load conditions
5448009 infrared surveys should be performed during periods of maximum possible loading but not less than 40 percent of rated load of the electrical equipment being inspected

5448048 ich glaube das hat unter anderem mit einem antiintellektualismus in den usa zu tun es ist eine ironie dass ausgerechnet ein land das von intellektuellen gegr ndet wurde an so einem punkt angekommen ist nat rlich haben wir auch viele intellektuelle aber in europa wo professoren und gelehrte auch mal im radio zu h ren sind sind universit ts und massenkultur viel st rker miteinander verbunden in den vereinigten staaten leben all die denker und brillanten menschen isoliert in ihrer universit tswelt

5448050 it was very painful the fact that you have someone telling you they will not help you because of who you are that they will deny your right to be a mother and have a family
5448051 it was clear and emphatic that discrimination has no place in doctors offices
5448052 okay now that must have some foundation of truth in it or g who is a very candid truthful sort would not have used his out loud voice with that statement

5448056 when you join a big club you have to expect competition i have always thrived on it

5448058 i know i have to step it up again football is a game that doesnt stay still i performed well last season and the fans voted me player of the year but thats all in the past now
5448059 i love it here the club wants to sign me and there wont be any problems on that front
5448060 its a very strong squad on paper and now we need to deliver a performance which indicates that strength
5448061 it is obviously disappointing not to be selected and you want to be playing for your country but if mr capello doesnt put you in the squad then we have to go out and prove him wrong
5448062 mr capello does come to villa quite a lot and i am not going to give up
5448063 but i want to play for my country ive played for the under 21s and i want to be in the full squad i want to get on the pitch and play and hopefully i can do that
5448064 but as soon as the squad is picked and if youre in the under 21 side you should be ready to roll your sleeves up and think i must do well in this squad
5448065 it is important that players view international football whether it be for the under 21 side or the seniors as an education
5448066 its so cool and i will try to keep my position as long as possible
5448067 i like to prove it not just say it i like to prove who is the best and who is the strongest

5448123 if it were true that older kids are able to learn at a faster rate then the differences in test scores should get bigger as kids progress and the material gets more difficult but we really see the opposite
5448124 kids learn at lot before kindergarten especially if theyre in preschool one way to think about it is that the oldest kid in kindergarten has about 20 percent more life experience
5448125 but once they start they basically learn at the same rate
5448126 older kids may do better at first but theres a tradeoff
5448127 theyre also a year in school behind other kids their own age at the end of the line somehow that year will catch up to them they start work a year later and parents have an extra year of child care costs if they delay entry so its not free
5448128 what we think is going on is that teachers are comparing younger kids to older classmates and the younger kids tend to stand out
5448129 they stand out either as not doing as well or they tend to stand out as being more hyperactive
5448130 older kids do better at first and younger kids do worse but they catch up
5448131 the thing is schools are making profound decisions based on these differences differences that tend to fade away
5448132 its clear the pattern is these academic differences get smaller as kids get older
5448133 it doesnt seem reasonable to us that there could be large long term gains from starting kindergarten at an older age when there isnt much of an effect for kids in eighth grade
5448134 this discovery may eventually lead to enhanced understanding of psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia obsessive compulsive disorder and attention deficit disorder all conditions in which a persons ability to remember and change such rules is impaired

5448142 there is no god and there is no soul hence there are no needs for the props of traditional religion with dogma and creed excluded then immutable truth is also dead and buried there is no room for fixed natural law or moral absolutes
5448143 no ones opinion is superior to anyone elses there is no hierarchy of truth or values anyones viewpoint is just as valid as anyone elses viewpoint we all have our own truth
5448144 its wrong for you to impose your morals on me
5448145 truth is relative theres no right and theres no wrong we should be able to do whatever we want
5448146 none of that is true we make our own reality

5448163 now is a terrific time for renewables to launch i hope they get all the capital they need and all the great minds and talent but i dont want it to come at the expense of the oil and gas industry
5448164 as goes colorado so goes the west as far as this energy policy debate
5448165 the future in colorado is building wind farms in wheat fields

5448168 it was one of those cases where the public was ahead of the politicians
5448169 its absolutely essential that the state offer us something that makes it worth our while to be green
5448170 weve reached this critical point where were seeing the deployment of these technologies accelerate
5448171 there was slow progress over the last decade and youre now seeing this tipping point
5448172 it could have been done in a different way and things wouldnt have gotten so heated
5448173 its chicken little all over again the sky is going to fall
5448174 the oil and gas companies see the writing on the wall the shift to renewables they want to make as much money as they can right now

5448176 there out on the dark street under a gnarly old tree and across from an abandoned church they found a girl of 17 who had not gotten up their daughter lawanda russell here she was just hours after selecting an outfit for her first day at a new high school bleeding barely conscious cut down in an american crossfire
5448177 lawanda russell became birminghams 55th homicide this year the 56th came the next day

5448183 people always ask me what ive bought with it i havent bought a thing it was about 600 000 after taxes and it went into investments after i finished fifth in l a in a wpt final several months earlier that was a big deal but now it just gets put aside
5448184 and it goes to buy ins to more tournaments because as we know the variance in high buy in mtts isnt very big right
5448185 i dont know ive played three 10 000 buy ins fifth in l a sixteenth in the heads up at the world series and the main event
5448186 i love it but thats because i was sick back then

5448208 russias invasion of georgia clearly demonstrates the strategic importance of the region
5448209 we need to make it clear both to the countries of the region and to russia that we take their sovereignty and independence seriously and that we deeply support their quest for international respect
5448210 if russia is able to get away with this invasion and destruction of life and property with impunity none of the small republics in the region is safe the answer to the concerns of people living in south ossetia or any other community is not a russian invasion it is the application of international law
5448211 the conservative party is using taxpayers money to fund the printing and mailing of electoral material
5448212 once again the conservatives show they have no respect for the electoral system it is a pattern weve seen recently with the in and out scandal and before that when stephen harper challenged campaign spending limits in court
5448213 some of their recent mailings feature a mock ballot with the names of the party leaders others blatantly misrepresent the facts this is electoral material that should be paid for by the conservative party not the taxpayer
5448214 the house of commons printing system is so bogged down by millions of conservative mailings that it is slowing legitimate communications with mps own constituents
5448215 its no coincidence that this comes at a time when mr harper is threatening to bypass his own law on election timing to force an election
5448216 we dont know if it was because of georgian military incompetence or the result of an effective electronic and cyber attack by the russians

5448486 how can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle
5448487 and he has made me blessed wheresoever i be and has enjoined on me sal t prayer and zak t as long as i live
5448488 and dutiful to my mother and made me not arrogant unblest

5448506 developments in genetics might allow treatment of the symptoms of ageing and this would result in greatly increased life expectancy for those who could afford it the divide between those that could afford to buy longevity and those that could not could aggravate perceived global inequality dictatorial or despotic rulers could potentially also buy longevity prolonging their regimes and international security risks

5448511 we were certainly interested in the fact that none of the spaceflight godfathers who talked about flying in space really focused on the robotics side
5448512 but thats not going to be an alien invasion of intelligent machines to displace us
5448513 ive made the case that we will have both the hardware and the software to achieve human level artificial intelligence with the broad suppleness of human intelligence including our emotional intelligence by 2029
5448514 were already a human machine civilisation we use our technology to expand our physical and mental horizons and this will be a further extension of that
5448515 our goal is to ask what benefits can we get out of this technology and how can we protect peoples privacy at the same time
5448516 we want to get a handle on the issues that would crop up if these systems become a reality
5448517 what if rfid readers were everywhere and everything had rfid tags what are the pluses and minuses what do you do with all that data
5448518 in computer science we try to create a future world that doesnt exist yet wed like to get some experience rather than just conjecture about this
5448519 asking for a contribution for each line magazine title in a new store is just not economically viable
5448520 the most annoying thing is asking for editorial space in magazines the implications of that are huge because tesco and sainsbury would want it too and then all of a sudden magazines are full of advertorials

5448533 how to run a startup and not lose your mind
5448534 we have wanted to develop this idea for several years
5448535 we knew we needed a unique format and the right host with the naked cowboy on board we have both
5448536 the naked cowboy is one of the most successful street performers in the country other shows have done a great job showcasing competition we plan to take a deeper dive with heart
5448537 ive weathered snow sleet and rain wearing only underwear in the most populated commercial real estate for over 10 years knowing that one day i would have a show of my own

5448554 i was having a nice round of golf with my wife she sliced her ball into a pasture of cows we went to look for it and while i was rooting around i noticed that one of the cows had something protruding from its rear end sure enough when it lifted its tail there was my wifes golf ball
5448555 the intention wasnt to look like bo derek or even gorgeous
5448556 since dostana is shot in miami my wardrobe has a beach vibe i wore a lot of shorts tank tops and tees
5448557 miami is the setting for the latest big budget movie by producer karan johar dostana directed by tarun mansukhani and starring priyanka chopra john abraham and abhishek bachchan revolves around two guys who pretend to be gay to get accommodation and end up falling for priyanka
5448558 we picked up the swimsuit in a store in miami it was really small
5448559 the choice of the swimsuits gold colour reminiscent of ursula andresss in dr no and bo dereks in 10 was a coincidence she said
5448560 we settled for gold because my skin is dusky and a perfect foil for the colour
5448561 the swimsuit also required priyanka to work on her figure the actress did not lose any weight for the movie but admits that she worked out to ensure a toned figure
5448562 i really worked out for fashion and dostana because i wanted a toned look so even though i had no competition from another girl in dostana i hit the gym with the boys
5448563 though priyanka may have drawn the line at a two piece dostana will sport no shortage of sculpted bodies on display another preview peek at shots from the movie shows off john abrahams perfectly toned body
5448564 faqs do i have to change the time zone in the add to calendar feature
5448565 people are saying that prices are too high it makes no sense to be chucking food away we want to have two classes allowing supermarkets to sell funny shaped vegetables
5448566 this years performance demonstrates the wisdom of our focus on steady results and the long term security of the pension fund
5448567 even in very difficult markets our pension fund performs steadily and protects the retirement benefits of more than 820 000 north carolinians our investment team avoided many of the pitfalls that other states experienced building on our tradition of solid management
5448568 hope therapy seeks to build on strengths people have or teach them how to develop those strengths we focus not on what is wrong but on ways to help people live up to their potential
5448569 if you feel you know how to get what you want out of life and you have that desire to make that happen then you have hope
5448570 what i think is exciting about hope therapy is the way we are learning from people who are doing very well we have been figuring out what hopeful people are doing right and taking those lessons and developing therapies and interventions for people who are not doing as well
5448571 the great news is that it seems to work we can teach people how to be more hopeful
5448572 postoperative ileus remains the single greatest barrier to hospital discharge in otherwise uncomplicated colorectal surgery
5448573 if this relatively easy safe and cheap intervention can help it is certainly something worth trying
5448574 we feel that the current evidence suggests that gum chewing following abdominal surgery offers significant benefits in reducing the time to resolution of ileus however the studies are insufficiently powered to identify a significant benefit in length of hospital stay
5448575 this doesnt mean that if you give someone chewing gum they will just jump out of bed and feel good enough to go home

5448578 business class standards continue to be upgraded by airlines across the world and singapore airlines managed to retain their title amidst this growing level of competition
5448579 such growth and quality levels are never easy to maintain but emirates has managed to maintain its global rating this year and can now use its airbus a380 aircraft to try and impress passengers in the coming year
5448580 etihad airways continues to expand its product and services fleet and destinations and skytrax 2008 survey is further recognition that the airline has established itself firmly on the global aviation stage
5448581 this performance was achieved as a result of the hard work and dedication of ethiopian employees astute leadership of the management team the strong support from the airlines customers and other stakeholders
5448582 fuel price remains of concern to the industry as a whole and ethiopian believes that costs will continue to escalate into the next quarter given the present trend in fuel prices

5448584 the july inflation number was high but the core inflation gain of 0 3 means the u s federal reserve has some breathing room on inflation some leeway to cut interest rates and theyre going to need it
5448585 first the u s housing market has not reached a bottom were not even close
5448586 people are watching the u s median home price currently about 206 500 when what they need to scrutinize is inventory levels were still at nine month and ten month inventories levels in most regions and a healthy market has only a three four month inventory level so dont look for any economic stimulus from the housing sector
5448587 we have lost more than 400 000 jobs since november 2007 and the losses are likely to continue for at least two more quarters q3 and q4 probably longer
5448588 even with adequate export activity its almost impossible for the u s economy to grow at or near capacity without job growth this workforce contraction will be a major factor in the feds decision to lower interest rates more
5448589 all recessions and expansions start for a reason during an expansion it frequently is a new sector like technology or a social trend such as u s veterans coming back from world war ii ready to marry start families buy homes and spend
5448590 thus far i dont see a catalyst for the next expansion this will also weigh on the fed which will further tip the scales in favor of lower rates
5448591 possibly in q2 2009 if were lucky but most likely not until q3 2009
5448592 my son is playing baseball i had breakfast at mcdonalds and im on my way to pick up a case of bud how about you

5448599 i think that sites like rushmoredrive are inevitable if search engines refuse to cede more control of search results to users
5448600 google and other web search engines rank results objectively rather than based on user specific considerations is there a way we can give control to users and thus make the search engines objective referees rather than paternalistic gatekeepers

5448604 suppose there were to be a powerful excitement on the subject of religion produced by means which are at war with the spirit of the gospel suppose doctrines were to be preached which the gospel does not recognize and doctrines omitted which the gospel regards fundamental suppose that for the simple and honest and faithful use of the sword of the spirit there should be substituted a mass of machinery designed to produce its effect on the animal passions suppose the substance of religion instead of being made to consist in repentance and faith and holiness lould consist of falling and groaning and shouting we should say unhesitatingly that that could not be a genuine work of divine grace or if there were some pure wheat there must be a vast amount of chaff and stubble
5448605 mark ronson needs to learn three chords on the guitar and write a tune instead of ruining everyone elses
5448606 i just wanted him to know that im actually taking guitar lessons from jay z right now and hes already taught me both chords to wonderwall
5448607 in fact its so much fun having jay teach me all of noels songs on the guitar hooray that im thinking of doing an oasis jay z remix album like danger mouses grey album
5448608 potential titles are champagne superhova or definitely jay z ill keep you posted

5448610 ive talked about heaven my whole life and ive given many messages on life after death
5448611 and ive counseled many people who have lost a loved one and i thought i knew a little bit about it
5448612 but i have to say that when it happens to you its a whole new world
5448613 ive been studying heaven and my desire to go there has even increased
5448614 and heaven is more real to me now than its ever before because i have an investment there you see and some of you do as well
5448615 now when youre old like me you know its coming but when youre young you think youre invincible when youre young you think oh not now maybe in 50 years maybe in 60 years and that may be true but death knocks at every door

5448625 i have nothing to say against scoring system or gojans strategy i guess i would have done the same and protected the lead had i been in his place
5448626 boxing may be a four round game but fortunes are made in the first two rounds and once you manage to take a lead its all about protecting the lead gojan didnt do anything wrong
5448627 anyway i have no excuse to offer it was simply not my day even though i tried my best i think the scoreline could have been different in the first round and that could have been crucial for me
5448628 still im not the one who would shed tears if i can celebrate win i should also have the guts to accept defeat my campaign is over but i will try to help jitender win his bout so that india gets medal from him and vijender also

5448630 we krijgen steeds vaker het gevoel dat transavia weinig moeite doet de geest van de vorige cao afspraken na te leven
5448631 wij willen heel graag werken aan een oplossing voor het conflict

5448634 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5448635 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5448636 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5448637 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5448638 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5448639 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law

5448643 if you need tetnis ill be more than happy to pay for it
5448644 oh my g d that is the coolest person alive
5448645 i particularly hope he obama strengthens his economic message even sen obama can speak more clearly and specifically about the kitchen table bread and butter issues like high energy costs its fine to tell people about hope and change but you have to have plenty of concrete pragmatic ideas that bring hope and change to life
5448646 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5448647 i would really like to see him do things in tennessee that would help in other working class and blue collar places like ohio job security and health care are huge here he needs to come to the aisle of home depot and show them that a harvard guaduate which i am as well knows how to help them
5448648 his message is the right one but he needs to turn up the volume and sharpen it a bit because these are voters who care a great great deal aobut the future of the economy he has to convince them that he is ready for that huge task

5448651 we have to set a date we are arranging for a meeting and well be meeting soon
5448652 we will have to sit down and discuss these issues in good faith
5448653 i wanted flexibility and an in principle understanding that the date could be reviewed if fiji for good reason was not able to meet the particular date
5448654 thats the reason he doesnt want to attend the meeting because he is scared of telling the forum about his plan and he understands the consequences if he does attend
5448655 if bainimarama goes the forum will want to know about his plans and how far fiji has progressed to get the country back to democracy
5448656 this is nothing new to the people as we have heard this over and over again
5448657 i am leaving with the satisfaction that whatever i could do for this country i did it with integrity
5448658 i am a human too i could have made mistakes but i believe that the people will forgive me
5448659 i publicly announced my support of the government and to the prime minister i told them i am ready to offer my experience but unfortunately the coalition took me for a problem not a solution
5448660 we will continue to work with the pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on pakistans future and its most urgent needs including stemming the growth of extremism addressing food and energy shortages and improving economic stability
5448661 the bush musharraf relationship really was key to the whole history of pakistan over the last eight or nine years
5448662 it was very personalized diplomacy and it was buttressed by a hefty dose of backing from vice president cheneys office it created an over reliance on one personality rather than a system
5448663 the peace process has moved beyond the establishment and musharrafs exit will not have an impact
5448664 we should welcome the fact that musharraf has resigned in order not to create instability in pakistan the impeachment process against him would have led to instability
5448665 the two main political parties must not fight amongst themselves for individual interests but work for the good of pakistan
5448666 these countries should also respect the verdict of the people of pakistan it is a good opportunity for them to play an important role
5448667 if we had kept katrinas portion bachna ae haseeno wouldve been one of the longest films in the history of hindi cinema much beyond three hours
5448668 nobody had the heart to break the news of doing away with katrinas track in bachna ae haseeno to her when she heard she was out katrina was really upset in fact katrinas track was one of our favourites but she saw our point of view when she saw the film
5448669 nobody had the heart to break the news to her when she heard she was out katrina was really upset what to do in fact katrinas track was one of our favourites but she saw our point of view when she saw the film
5448670 the only reason we dropped the katrina track was because it hadnt been shot otherwise shes the biggest star weve in our film katrina has had only one flop in her entire career dropping her track had upset all of us

5448675 the talks during the visit to fiji by foreign ministers new zealands winston peters and australias stephen smith were a positive move forward
5448676 ccf had encouraged fiji to attend the forum leaders meeting in niue as the progress of fijis return to democracy and assistance from the region would have been discussed there
5448677 all of my official on the record correspondence with gannett corporate has been through the companys chief spokeswoman tara connell you can see our last exchange at gannettblog
5448678 the most direct feedback ive received from connell was in the form of her objections to the to the first of a series of posts about the gannett foundation
5448679 i have been a business reporter for most of the 22 years ive been a
5448680 i outlined my principal motivation for starting gannett blog on jan 11
5448681 rumors flew that gannett was planning to sell us to the competition or dump us into a joint operating agreement more than 700 employee families were desperate for information
5448682 as the papers business news editor i managed some of the newsroom staffers reporting on the gazette s demise we called gannetts corporate office pleading for information over and over and again and again we got this no comment
5448683 today much of gannett is experiencing the uncertainty we saw in arkansas in the summer of 1991 but now technology empowers the companys nearly 50 000 employees to communicate in ways not possible 16 years ago start more blogs id like to build a companywide network
5448684 bottom line i started gannett blog so employees would have a safe place to share information about the company without fear of reprisal from management as they prepared themselves for a vastly changed industry
5448685 ive written that i only plan to keep gannett blog about two or three years as long as the company remains substantially in its current form that said year no three would start this coming october if gannett is dramatically re shaped i will stop blogging about the company
5448686 ive never addressed the notion of disloyalty because its never been an issue for me i neither hate nor love gannett i do however care deeply for its front line hourly employees many of whom are also small stockholders
5448687 in july the most recent period for which ive reported traffic

5448693 the aggressive russian force beyond south ossetian borders has been something that really shocked many people the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki the russian blockade of the georgian port of poti is a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by
5448694 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of any possible conflict
5448695 any fairy tales about deterring other states fairy tales that with the help of this system we will deter some sort of rogue states no longer work
5448696 poland in deploying the us system opens itself to a nuclear strike that is 10
5448697 if the eu wants to play a role in reaching peace it needs open channels of dialogue to tbilisi and to moscow
5448698 calls from some eu member states particularly those in eastern europe to deal harshly with moscow by scrapping talks with russia on a new strategic partnership have put germany in a tricky position germany is heavily dependent on russian energy and remains an advocate of closer european ties with moscow

5448703 grave concern over the escalation of tension and armed conflicts
5448704 relevant parties to keep restraint and to cease fire immediately
5448705 crowd was persuaded to disperse and leave and no extreme actions took place
5448706 disputes be resolved peacefully through dialogue so as to achieve regional peace and stability
5448707 rapidly escalated the tension and raised international concerns and public anxiety
5448708 some analysts even showed the concern that military antagonism could evolve into a new version of the cold war
5448709 war is not the way to settle conflicts the only way to effectively resolve disputes is to disregard old grievances cease hostilities and negotiate for peace only in the backdrop of peace and in the framework of constructive negotiation can a win win deal be reached
5448710 an analysis of americas global missile defense system shows that washington is deploying its elements primarily in eastern europe rather than japan or other asian countries or australia this is probably because washington does not want to irritate china which could respond by stepping up the development of its own missile program and increasing the number of intercontinental ballistic missiles on combat duty
5448711 despite its diminished status following the soviet breakup in 1991 russia alone possesses weapons that can destroy the united states a military industrial complex nearly americas equal in exporting arms and the planets largest oil and natural gas reserves it also remains the worlds largest territorial country pivotally situated in the west and the east at the crossroads of colliding civilizations with strategic capabilities from europe iran and other middle east nations to north korea china india afghanistan and even latin america all things considered our national security may depend more on russia than russias does on us
5448712 nabucco was not planned to be an anti russian project but to be a pro european project the main focus is to transport gas from alternate sources
5448713 we continue to be adequately capitalized and we are committed to raising additional capital were financially sound and have strong liquidity

5448715 the day after halloween we will be releasing the first ever helix christmas cd entitled helix heavy mental christmas
5448716 we are very excited about this project and with good reason
5448717 the release of heavy mental christmas will coincide with a western canadian tour in november we also hope to play our hometown of london around the same time period we will announce our tour dates as we get them
5448718 a view of the water is not a matter of life or death it is something much more important than that
5448719 this unprecedented nationwide tour by the entire commission is part of our commitment to prepare and educate consumers about the digital television transition
5448720 we are extremely disappointed to see that the level of objectivity at nbc news has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
5448721 we welcome any opportunity to speak with officials from both campaigns and many of us at nbc news are in contact with the mccain campaign literally on a daily basis with all due respect to the campaign leadership they are viewing our coverage through a political prism we stand by our reporting our journalism and our journalists
5448722 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5448723 make no mistake this is a serious charge andrea mitchell is repeating uncritically a completely unsubstantiated obama campaign claim that john mccain somehow cheated in last nights forum at saddleback church
5448724 instead of trying to substantiate this blatant falsehood andrea mitchell felt that she needed to repeat it on air to millions of meet the press viewers with no indication that 1 theres not one shred of evidence that its true 2 in his official correspondence to both campaigns pastor rick warren provided both candidates with information regarding the topic areas to be covered which barack obama acknowledged during the forum when asked about pastor warrens idea of an emergency plan for orphans and obama said i cheated a little bit
5448725 this is irresponsible journalism and sadly indicative of the level of objectivity we have witnessed from nbc news this election cycle we are concerned that your news division is following msnbcs lead in abandoning nonpartisan coverage of the presidential race we would like to request a meeting with you as soon as possible to discuss our deep concerns about the news standards and level of objectivity at nbc
5448726 one of humanitys great conquests is indeed the overcoming of racism unfortunately however there are new and worrying examples of this in various countries often linked to social and economic problems that nonetheless can never justify contempt or racial discrimination
5448727 and therefore also to italy where sorry to say there are many signs of racism that trouble us and which cannot be hidden
5448728 at the end of the nineteenth century the birth of the biggest modern empire was accompanied by the birth of a powerful whaling fleet the americans helped themselves to all the resources needed for beginning their industry and you whales were no exception your oil would make machines run and lights softly burn
5448729 americans reduced you whales to a commodity on the stock exchange
5448730 every whale that dies hands down to us like a prophecy the image of our own death

5448736 how does faith work in your life on a daily basis
5448737 does evil exist and if it does do we ignore it do we negotiate with it do we contain it or do we defeat it
5448738 sir satellite imagery shows a build up of evil in eastern buttfuckistan and we believe evil may be planning something big for the rose bowl
5448739 have some humility in how we approach the issue of confronting evil
5448740 here as elsewhere obama stayed at a high level of abstraction while obama talked of confronting evil mccain spoke of defeating it
5448741 whether i win or lose the impeachment the nation will lose
5448742 they dont realize they can succeed against me but the country will undergo irreparable damage
5448743 nobodys come up with a way to prevent this from happening even here in the u s
5448744 the u s is probably more internet dependent than any place in the world so to that extent were more vulnerable than any place in the world to this kind of attack
5448745 so much of what were doing in the united states is out there on the internet and all of that can be taken down at once
5448746 this is such a crucial issue at every level our security now is dependent on computers
5448747 its a whole new era political and military conflicts now will almost always have a cyber component the chief targets will be critical infrastructure and the attacks will emerge from within our own computer systems
5448748 it only takes a couple of experts it doesnt take a whole cyber infantry division to pull something like this off
5448749 for a very small investment in resources you can have a huge impact
5448750 when it comes to our government it security were pretty strong in protecting against attacks
5448751 we can command so much bandwidth that its hard to overwhelm our servers
5448752 we are vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks but right now most of the people who want to do us harm dont have those capabilities
5448753 youd see some disruption of essential services like electricity youd definitely see espionage
5448754 would it be decisive no nobodys going to win a conflict with the united states in cyberspace but would it be disruptive and irritating yes
5448755 when it comes to our government it security were pretty strong in protecting against attacks
5448756 we can command so much bandwidth that its hard to overwhelm our servers
5448757 we are vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks but right now most of the people who want to do us harm dont have those capabilities

5448762 first pray for the candidates for yourself and for wisdom second check the candidates out not just their position on issues but also their character and competence third register to vote fourth and above all vote
5448763 if you are saying i dont like either candidate maybe i wont vote then i say you need to move to another country because if you dont you are giving up a privilege which people died to make possible
5448764 president musharraf has made the right decision to step down as president of pakistan
5448765 a year ago i advocated that the us move from a musharraf policy to a pakistan policy i hope all of pakistans friends will now seize the opportunity created by musharrafs exit to focus on the urgent issues of today confronting the threat of extremist violence dealing with food and energy shortages and helping the pakistani people build a stable secure democratic future
5448766 the resignation of president pervez musharraf is a step toward moving pakistan onto a more stable political footing pakistan is a critical theater in countering the threat of al qaeda and violent islamic extremism and i look forward to the government increasing its future cooperation there are serious problems that must be addressed the situation in pakistans frontier regions requires immediate and continued attention and i hope that the elections for president musharrafs successor will serve to reconcile the pakistani people behind a leader who can solidify their government internally it is critical that the united states continue to work in partnership with the pakistani people and their democratically elected government to tackle the many challenges we both face
5448767 every year these remarkable young adults embark on this trip of a lifetime and speaking from personal experience i know it changed their lives
5448768 this summer the riders battled hail rain wind and snow yet at the end of the day they will get off their bikes and rest cancer patients do not have that luxury
5448769 this ride is longer than two tour de france bike races so it is absolutely astounding to see these riders push their bodies and minds to the test and travel more than 4 500 miles all to draw awareness to cancer
5448770 these young people demonstrate strong character and they are truly excellent role models in their desire to do their part and make a difference
5448771 raise international awareness about the prison like closure of the gaza strip and pressure the international community to review its sanctions policy and end its support for continued israeli occupation
5448772 allowing the ships to reach the gaza coastline could create a dangerous precedent

5448774 it may be interesting to see whether there was any discussion about the size of rate cuts and their relationship to bank lending rates which seem to have become the interest rates that the rba has become most interested in for policy purposes

5448819 many of these commercial projects are in important planning stages right now and the overall industry is at the tipping point that will lead to widespread adoption
5448820 the absence of the itc will kill most if not all of this growing momentum we need only look to the interruption of tax credits for the wind industry for an example of something that we do not want to repeat this would be a real shame
5448821 over the longer term however the united states commercial market is far too important to be ignored
5448822 a consistent itc policy extending over several years that allows industry to grow and flourish is critical to the industry
5448823 the itc has become a very politicized issue however and its possible that approval could extend into 2009

5448832 i would say at some point this week well get bob and dwight back probably wednesday
5448833 im getting ready to go and hopefully ill be able to get out there this week
5448834 thats my plan well see hopefully ill be starting this week
5448835 im definitely ready ive been anxious for a long time im excited and ready to go i worked hard got back and my body feels great i feel excellent so im just excited and truly truly blessed to be able to come back and just be ready
5448836 if they dont have setbacks in practice i think they both will play sunday and have kind of a limited pitch count
5448837 that would be my hope but well see what happens
5448838 physically i always say we all can endure it i think the tackling is there we dont do much tackling in practice we go straight out in the games and thats when we get our tackling in i think its more getting that chemistry with the first guys and getting that timing down
5448839 i think if you get some games under your belt before you get out there full speed first game of the season you probably play a little bit better
5448840 it really goes with the individual with their feeling no 1 and with their assistant coach their position coach depending on what position they play some positions its easier to play without practicing than others everyones an individual decision
5448841 that will cause us to move some people around but other than that i think we came through without many major injuries
5448842 its ireland an isolated and kind of misty place and youd really have to have the right story for it but its a great atmosphere you know right away you are going to get a beautiful film those grey skies and the terrain
5448843 sean has done the best job of running our entire offense and doing everything that we need to do with our offense
5448844 he has a little more huddle command right now and thats simply because hes older and has more experience diondre is making great strides and sean knows that diondre is a person we trust to put into the ball game you have to start somewhere and you have to start someone for that first series we feel we have two guys that we can use
5448845 sean setzer will be our starting quarterback for the unlv game but we anticipate diondre borel will be in the game a significant amount of time because he adds another dimension to our offense with his running skills
5448846 i think we are going to be the greenest convention in gop history said joanna burgos press secretary for the convention which will be held sept 1 4
5448847 my opponent wants to withdraw our forces from iraq no matter the circumstances no matter the reason id like to tell you my friends that there is only one circumstance under which ill consider a withdraw victory in 2004 when i urged a change in tactics in iraq it was to be victorious i stood for victory in iraq in 2006 when few other people in washington were courageous to do so and now in 2008 when victory in iraq is within our grasp i will withdraw our troops only when they can come home with their heads held high knowing that they have done their job and they have the victory for which they have fought so bravely
5448848 the surge has succeeded and yet senator obama still cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment nor has he been willing to heed the guidance of general petraeus or to listen to our troops on the ground when they say as they have said to me on my trips to iraq let us win just let us win instead senator obama commits the greater error of insisting that even in hindsight even in hindsight he would oppose the surge both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5448849 in addition a large majority 69 per cent of the experts considers pakistan the country most likely to transfer nuclear technology to terrorists
5448850 in 2007 10 per cent of experts named the iraq war as the greatest threat to us security in may 2008 not a single expert did
5448851 aha now i know what all that digging was about
5448852 were all in this together and the people of pakistan and the government of pakistan know that
5448853 so were confident that while we certainly all have more to do when it comes to fighting terrorism the government of pakistan will continue in the effort
5448854 while this political process is under way we certainly expect theyll keep up their fight against terrorists and extremists and because of what i just said this is a fight that they are in as well
5448855 thats what the prime minister said when he was in washington
5448856 president bush is committed to a strong pakistan that continues its efforts to strengthen democracy and fight terror
5448857 president bush appreciates president musharrafs efforts in the democratic transition of pakistan as well as his commitment to fighting al qaeda and extremist groups
5448858 president bush looks forward to working with the government of pakistan on the economic political and security challenges they face
5448859 the extremist ideology is one that has been out there and among these groups for many years
5448860 lets be very clear about where this started and thats with the extremists
5448861 a friend to the united states and one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism

5448864 we are delighted to welcome judd back to wgn radio
5448865 his national hockey league experience and expertise along with a lifetime of following the blackhawks make him the ideal choice to join john and troy on our broadcasts of blackhawks hockey
5448866 we will do whatever is necessary and no one should have any illusion
5448867 the russian side is gravely violating the conditions provided for by the peace accord signed by the presidents of georgia france and the russian federation
5448868 persistent delay in the withdrawal of its forces from georgia
5448869 lets then start thinking negotiating how can we prevent the definitive estrangement of our two countries
5448870 we have to move away from this total ban and find ways for people to let off steam a little bit more but safely
5448871 weve got to allow political videos but with some safeguards

5448880 we are seeing evidence of ss 21 missiles in south ossetia
5448881 but let me be clear if it rolled in after august 6th it needs to roll out
5448882 that would be in keeping with the russian commitment on withdrawal
5448883 anything such as that or any other military equipment that was moved in would be in violation of the ceasefire and should be removed immediately
5448884 the only forces that are permitted to remain under the ceasefire agreement are the forces that were in there at the august 6th timeframe
5448885 were seeing them solidify their positions in south ossetia and abkhazia
5448886 i cant say whether they are actually moving people out right now or not but we do expect them to start moving out we expect them to move out slowly so this may take some time
5448887 when we received news of the first two ss 21 russian missile launchers into georgian territory

5448897 showed their hostility to the freedom of the afghan people
5448898 these reports indicate that the enemies of the people of afghanistan intend to attack civilian military and government targets during afghan independence celebrations
5448899 the demonstrators were simply standing on the side of the road route 24 holding pictures and banners they did not interfere with traffic and did not approach any vehicles they simply wanted to put their message out there in a peaceful way which is exactly what they did last i checked the first amendment gives us the right to express ourselves in this way
5448900 this group opposes abortion and so they show pictures of abortions to help their cause its no different from anti war activists using pictures of the horrors of war to help their cause the message itself is irrelevant because the first amendment applies in all cases im thankful that in the end the authorities got it right and dropped the charges
5448901 if you believe our civil liberties are getting trampled on then you better stand up and take notice
5448902 by simply quoting the police spokesperson the reporter only got one side of the story the wrong side as it turns out it is incumbent on the media to investigate what happened and not just regurgitate the story they get from the authorities since the charges have been dropped it is clear that the police spokesperson was inaccurate in his statements which means that the suns reporting of the story was almost entirely untrue despite outreach from the demonstration organizers to the suns editors the story has yet to be retracted or corrected and that is a shame rather than report the compelling story that police overstepped their authority the sun has decided to leave their inaccurate story as the final word implying that the demonstrators rather than the police were the bad guys in this episode
5448903 the cradle rocks above an abyss and common sense tells us that our existence is but a brief crack of light between two eternities of darkness
5448904 any compromise between good and evil only works to the detriment of the good and to the benefit of the evil
5448905 the real rulers in washington are invisible and exercise power from behind the scenes
5448906 if anyone thinks that they can kill our citizens and escape unpunished we will never allow this if anyone tries this again we will come out with a crushing response
5448907 we have all the necessary resources political economic and military if anyone had any illusions about this they have to abandon them
5448908 we do not want a deterioration of international relations we want to be respected we want our people our values to be respected
5448909 we have always been a peace loving state practically there is not a single occasion in the history of the russian or soviet state when we first started military actions we have not attacked anyone we only secured the rights and dignity of people as peacekeepers
5448910 i yearn for you tragically a t tappman chaplain u s army
5448911 we have recently adopted a policy of excluding sickly sentimentality which particularly when sung by certain vocalists can become nauseating and not at all in keeping with what we feel to be the need of the public in this country in the fourth year of war
5448912 any compromise between good and evil only works to the detriment of the good and to the benefit of the evil
5448913 the real rulers in washington are invisible and exercise power from behind the scenes

5448917 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5448918 we the citizens of the united states of america have the ultimate responsibility to elect the
5448919 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
5448920 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
5448921 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
5448922 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
5448923 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
5448924 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a 1 in 3 chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
5448925 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
5448926 its kind of a weird process if you stop and think about it
5448927 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
5448928 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
5448929 how could they accuse of me of doing something wrong
5448930 if im not re elected our state will lose its influence
5448931 energy questions in the united states flow from the very fact that we have an energy policy in the first place

5448935 for eight years weve had a vice president who stayed in undisclosed locations trust me its already change we can believe in its just the next vice presidents identity thats undisclosed
5448936 the institutional culture of corruption embraced by the clinton leadership of the democratic party
5448937 unaccountable power for the clintons at the expense of the rule of law and respect for the constitutional processes of government
5448938 especially since it was days after she said she wouldnt take any more money from me
5448939 sen obama needs someone experienced in foreign policy and or running a state or corporation joe biden would be good
5448940 ive just got home from an early screening of hellboy ii the golden army hosted by popcorntaxi at the greater union cinema in sydney where guillermo did a telephone q amp a from berlin after the film the last question though related to the hobbit and guillermo said that although there was nothing to add at the moment he can say that scripting has started and he described the process as something beautiful

5448943 id have to say that monckton won the debate he came across as more prepared and had answers at his fingertips whereas richard appeared to verbally stumble on occasion
5448944 i got the impression that littlemore was engaging in the debate totally unprepared
5448945 oh my this is very confusing no wonder the government says its too early to take action
5448946 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5448947 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5448948 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5448949 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5448950 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america

5448954 tom horton amrs executive vice president of finance and planning and chief financial officer said american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
5448955 enable the airlines to reduce costs and attract new customers helping to mitigate pressure on airfares from record fuel costs
5448956 we do not agree with the faas findings and characterizations of americans action in these cases we believe the proposed penalties are excessive

5448960 this is a pricing matter we cant discuss future plans
5448961 many military have government travel cards that can be used for fees
5448962 who knows but that on the lower frequencies i speak for you
5448963 it was the first time the democratic party spelled out directly what it believed had to be done to reduce abortions in america
5448964 this being the case we are looking for common ground
5448965 people who follow this issue closely are going to be impressed by it
5448966 because they know the influence that naral naral pro choice america has had on the democratic party for decades
5448967 we have given to barack obama enough language for him to take this language and mold it in a way that will draw catholics and evangelicals conservative jewish people muslims into seeing the democratic party as a party that is receptive to their beliefs about human life
5448968 this is why john mccain will win the presidency and we will be plunged into another decade of war and bankruptcy concurrent with a precipitous decline into global irrelevance loss of empire roving zombie hordes etc
5448969 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5448970 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama

5448973 universities are turning to private investment in order to achieve new housing that is financed off their balance sheet the use of private equity and debt positively impacts a universitys borrowing capacity thereby leaving the institutions credit available to finance academic buildings rather than housing

5448980 everybody said the market would turn positive in july before the games so we listened and stayed in it
5448981 in july they said that the market would return when the olympics came what spirit is that now we are all dead and have no spirit left in the market
5448982 theres no logic to follow no other market falls as badly and accidentally as ours
5448983 it should be good now with the olympics inflation going down but that has nothing to do with the market in china i am so deeply trapped there is nothing i can do my account used to have 32 000 and now its only something like 8 800

5449008 the cleanup of the former anvil points oil shale site is long overdue and a sad reminder of the legacy of the 1982 oil shale bust
5449009 while i am pleased that the bureaucracy in washington is finally moving ahead with the cleanup the administration is still selling colorado short todays certification allows the state of colorado to receive some of the revenues from future lease sales to which it is entitled and this is an important step but the federal government is still trying to stiff colorado on more than 50 million in the cleanup fund those revenues should go to western slope communities that are most affected by energy development

5449014 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
5449015 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
5449016 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
5449017 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
5449018 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
5449019 never use this in arena because of the 20 damage taken
5449020 just read the animation and dont hit the warrior if he uses it
5449021 lets make every class overpowered so it cancels out in the end
5449022 sen obama made it clear that he was really going to get into the nuts and bolts of the kinds of questions oregonians are talking about and i think it has served him well in our state
5449023 im confident that once sen obama gets as well known in these larger states as he has in oregon he is going to see the same success elswhere
5449024 we confront more than the usual number of people who dont respond or cant respond people are away from their homes heading back from summer vacation or preparing their children for the start of the school year
5449025 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
5449026 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
5449027 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
5449028 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
5449029 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground

5449032 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
5449033 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect

5449059 they are destroying everything and then pulling out of these places
5449060 if they call this a pullout then i do not understand the meaning of the word
5449061 these are our people our countrymen and their commitment to mexico is vital to this country
5449062 he wants us to send more money well get us more jobs
5449063 you send money depending on how your work is if theres no work you dont send any
5449064 they feel it there because the economy is bad there too but whether its a little or a lot you send money to your family no matter what the government says
5449065 on the one hand they are asking for our support on the other hand they arent giving us the tools to invest
5449066 we want the united states to recognize our matricula consulares as our official ids but they dont in mexico
5449067 there is no consistency they want migrants to invest in mexico but we cant get a legal id

5449070 i would like to distinguish two notions the notion of withdrawal and that of pullout
5449071 so in a telephone conversation between our president and french president nicolas sarkozy they spoke only about the pullout i hope you notice the subtlety we are not talking about withdrawal here
5449072 there is no indication to us that they have begun to pull back
5449073 if somebody thinks that he can with impunity murder our citizens murder our soldiers and officers who are peacekeepers we will never allow this
5449074 all those who try to do something like that will get a crushing response

5449083 for us this meeting is not as amicable as it might seem
5449084 a game against england at wembley has a lot importance and we are thoroughly prepared to offer a good show
5449085 the euros are forgotten and what matters now is to prepare in the best possible way for the qualifying rounds for world cup 2010 playing against england will help this
5449086 i am motivated by this meeting a clash at wembley will raise morale and hopefully we can perform well and win this wednesday
5449087 the czech republic is undergoing a renovation after the euros but we have quality players to be at the top of europe now our dream is a place at the world cup 2010
5449088 the england team was not at the euros but that does not detract from the fact they have great figures to me it was a big surprise they did not qualify
5449089 david beckham has enough quality to continue to lead them being in front of people like beckham lampard terry rooney and gerrard will bring the best out of us

5449113 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
5449114 a remarkable indictment of the corruption and cynicism rife among climate scientists
5449115 if nothing is done all the polar bears could die in our lifetime

5449120 few seem to realise that the present ipcc models predict almost unanimously that by 2040 the average summer in europe will be as hot as the summer of 2003 when over 30 000 died from heat by then we may cool ourselves with air conditioning and learn to live in a climate no worse than that of baghdad now but without extensive irrigation the plants will die and both farming and natural ecosystems will be replaced by scrub and desert what will there be to eat

5449149 when the bilateral agreements were debated everybody talked about wage dumping but no one thought about the impact on the rental market
5449150 but it has put a lot of pressure on rents
5449151 landlords are now taking more and more apartments out of the general market to provide more expensive accommodation furnished and with services to these new people who can afford to pay more
5449152 zurich is a rich city but there are still many people who need to find low rental prices they are now in trouble because it is becoming very difficult to find it
5449153 if it continues like this then it will become difficult for essential workers like nurses and police officers to live here
5449154 families are having to relocate further away from the centre finding new schools for their children and severing links with their social contacts
5449155 local people are migrating to winterthur because it is less expensive and has very good links to zurich

5449182 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5449183 cone of silence is a silly term i used from maxwell smart
5449184 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5449185 when he ascended on high he led a host of captives

5449196 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
5449197 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
5449198 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance

5449229 all commodities found in a country which cannot be used in their natural state should be worked up within the country since the payment for manufacturing generally exceeds the value of raw material by two three ten twenty and even a hundred fold and the neglect of this is an abomination to prudent managers
5449230 that the united states fought long and hard against the economic theories that today they vehemently support
5449231 because people in the plantations being tempted with a free market for their growths all over europe will all betake themseves to raise them to answer the prodigious demand of that free trade and their heads be quite taken off from manufactures
5449232 real wages in peru peaked when the country did everything wrong according to the washington institutions how nafta destroyed mexicos manufacturing how china and india are developing by completely ignoring imf policy
5449233 to receive support from the rich countries poor countries had to refrain from using the policies the rich countries had used and often still use these are the conditionalities of the washington institutions
5449234 todays best advice to third world countries is dont do as the americans tell you to do do as the americans did
5449235 above all we cannot ask the dominican authorities in charge of fighting the crime in all manifestations to be harsh with those crimes if we dont provide the necessary economic resources
5449236 what can the country can become is a dependent society a society where our children where our grandsons our families are constantly placed under a state of terror because drug trafficking doesnt give a truce

5449245 wanna bet i cant write a whole book set almost entirely in a car
5449246 and i said yeah i speak german like a native
5449247 there was a drug store i went in called the number and they said dean you stay outside and well pick you up in a staff car and they drove me up towards mount vernon and thats how i ended up at fort hunt it must have been end of november early december 1944
5449248 my job was to interrogate scientifically trained and experienced germans who had been sent to this country by the military
5449249 one of them was a person who worked on enriching uranium and i didnt know why anybody would want to enrich uranium i mean what does this have to do with anything
5449250 and so my job was to find out what he was doing and how it was being carried out and then i reported this to the pentagon
5449251 many of the archives were destroyed directly after the war and so if we didnt have the opportunity to speak with these men and capture their stories much of it may have been lost forever
5449252 there were a group of men sitting around a table in a room with great huge recorders recording everything these people said to each other
5449253 and so it sort of threw the prisoners off how did you know this how did you know that my daughter was 17 on march 28th so it really put them at a disadvantage
5449254 i was a pretty good athlete i would do sports with them in order to make them more cooperative i would take some of the people out for dinner at a restaurant in town in civilian clothes
5449255 it took quite some time before he was willing to cooperate the war had ended in europe and at that point he said hes willing to help us but his wife was at that point in what was in the russian zone
5449256 we told the sales person what size and so on and the woman held up a pair of panties
5449257 that should be long so as to cover their legs
5449258 for 63 years nobody ever said thank you and it was very nice to receive recognition that what we did was being recognized of being helpful to our country
5449259 yes we threatened them with being sent back to russia but there was no other personal harm of any kind and people thought they could be most effective as interrogators by being nice to the people they interrogated
5449260 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5449261 this was a barbaric act carried out by the enemies of afghanistan at a time of celebration of independence
5449262 the terrorists showed that they are vigorously against the freedom of the afghan people and cannot bear to see the celebration of independence and the happiness of the afghan people
5449263 these reports indicate that the enemies of the people of afghanistan intend to attack civilian military and government targets during afghan independence celebrations
5449264 we recommend to all afghans to be vigilant at large public events and other locations where crowds gather and report suspicious behavior to security forces afghan or coalition and government representatives
5449265 let us shun tribal linguistic and regional issues and wage jihad against the enemies of this country and its religion and their mercenaries so we can mark the independence anniversary in its actual form
5449266 i would love to know why the medai doesnt press obamas refusal to name three people he admires

5449282 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5449283 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5449284 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5449285 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5449286 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5449287 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5449288 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5449289 salman rushdie has agreed to divorce his wife padma lakshmi because of her desire to end their marriage

5449292 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
5449293 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four

5449297 just so you all know we did set a record
5449298 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
5449299 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
5449300 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about

5449326 he needs to be paying attention to what happened what we do in the command truck we record from the live tv feed that weve got so that he can review whats going on at the scene and know what hes got before he ever gets there that means that he cant take the time to be driving he needs to be paying attention to whats going on

5449329 they were incredibly small nay so small in my sight that i judged that even if 100 of these very wee animals lay stretched out one against another they could not reach to the length of a grain of coarse sand
5449330 go auntie georgian way of calling an unknown woman go leave
5449331 i can promise you one thing the story isnt boring
5449332 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5449333 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5449334 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5449335 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5449336 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5449337 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5449338 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5449339 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
5449340 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
5449341 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
5449342 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
5449343 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
5449344 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
5449345 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
5449346 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5449347 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5449348 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5449349 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5449350 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5449351 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5449352 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
5449353 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
5449354 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
5449355 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
5449356 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
5449357 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
5449358 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
5449359 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
5449360 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
5449361 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
5449362 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
5449363 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
5449364 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
5449365 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
5449366 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
5449367 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
5449368 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
5449369 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
5449370 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
5449371 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
5449372 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition

5449384 isnt it a little late for you to be out
5449385 we made up a plan that we were going to tell the cops that nobody kicked him that there were no racial slurs there was no booze and brian got hit first
5449386 his only response was that he wanted to hang out there which was not a very compelling reason
5449387 i showed her all the paperwork and tried to explain to her the circumstances but she wouldnt listen she called me all sorts of horrible names and stormed off
5449388 all of it was spent on making her as big as she is now its not my fault that she only has 20 000 to her name
5449389 well honestly most people werent expecting me to come out here and do something so with that in mind it was not do or die i didnt go out there to prove to anybody just to myself
5449390 when i leave what am i going to do to support myself and these kids
5449391 will i be able to handle the stress and will they hate me for the rest of their lives for doing this to them

5449393 will provide existing and expanding refineries on the texas gulf coast with an efficient and reliable alternative for imported crude oil delivery
5449394 being dragged into yet another war which we cannot afford
5449395 for three years we have been saying that war is coming and the team has been working hard to deliver on this promise
5449396 in just a few weeks we are going to throw open our doors and invite more players into the game than ever before they will have a chance to delve into the open beta and see for themselves that war has arrived and it is glorious

5449401 at this point we havent gotten a missing person report from anyone
5449402 were still really trying to come up with an identity
5449403 the last shes seen is walking east on east main street by the bridge
5449404 were hoping just to be able to come up with an identity of this person so then we can verify that nothing bad has happened to them
5449405 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
5449406 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
5449407 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
5449408 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
5449409 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
5449410 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
5449411 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
5449412 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
5449413 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
5449414 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
5449415 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
5449416 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
5449417 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
5449418 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
5449419 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
5449420 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
5449421 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
5449422 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
5449423 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
5449424 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
5449425 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
5449426 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
5449427 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
5449428 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
5449429 simply a tolerable acknowledgment of beliefs widely held among the people of this country
5449430 computer games dont affect kids i mean if pac man affected us as kids wed all be running around in darkened rooms munching magic pills and listening to repetitve electonic dance music
5449431 exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination based on a persons sexual orientation
5449432 for purposes of the free speech clause simple obedience to a law that does not require one to convey a verbal or symbolic message cannot reasonably be seen as a statement of support for the law or its purpose such a rule would in effect permit each individual to choose which laws he would obey merely by declaring his agreement or opposition
5449433 sit down and count the cost a framework for constitutionally enforcing the 501 c 3 campaign intervention ban
5449434 i know its only a tropical storm but we take it seriously
5449435 lets face it this is not the big one but lets practice like it is
5449436 i said to myself either shes a good actor and a good liar or what they have done to her is really crummy
5449437 i grew up watching ed mcmahon i think hes a terrific guy
5449438 even a man who hadnt had such a great career shouldnt have this happen to them in their later years im doing my best but this is a very difficult situation
5449439 lets just see what the deal is and what were offered
5449440 in a typical deal the person who buys it is doing it as an investment because its a good piece of property
5449441 so they expect the person living there to cover the carrying costs the insurance the gardening the utilities the taxes when a persons in trouble they dont even have the money to even do that so a lot of them go very sour
5449442 youre acting as a child protecting your parent theyre hoping itll be a good investment but if not its going to be there
5449443 he doesnt tie up 4 8 million in cash to own a 4 8 million asset
5449444 it was a good day today with a score line of 2 and 4 it was a bit of a bummer as that 4 should have been a 2 but we got a bit tangled up with the tornados who were finishing at the same time
5449445 it has been a long day on the water i am a bit crispy even after applying two rounds of sun lube i am feeling a bit overcooked today
5449446 this racing is very tight and very stressful i think i may have aged 20 years in the last two days hopefully by the end of the regatta i wont look like i am 70 years old or something
5449447 this might be the only weakness with our p star boat is the upper wind range so we need to get through tomorrow with some good finishes and live to fight another day
5449448 regattas like this you need to not get too high or too low mentally its a long week and its wacky racing no matter how deep you are in the fleet never give up this is key going forward
5449449 some of the other top teams have had a few bad races so its time to put the gas pedal down and turn the screws a bit more
5449450 we didnt have any plans to be the biggest school or have a pharmacy school or two other campuses
5449451 the physician work force is aging and lecom is helping fill some of the gaps in the system
5449452 country folk are a little different than city folk are they dont quickly run to the doctor every time they stub their toe
5449453 they are quick to look at alternative forms of treatment if you take the time to listen to them they are willing to follow through
5449454 we are definitely seeing lecom graduates serve their residencies in erie and then develop their medical practices in erie
5449455 they are around the area and they are making a difference
5449456 on a one on one basis there is no difference between a lecom student and one from another osteopathic or allopathic m d medical school
5449457 lecom has been very mature very innovative in establishing its curriculum
5449458 they brought in top medical educators to establish the curriculum and theyve remained on the cutting edge
5449459 they save a years tuition and they are out practicing medicine a year earlier reducing their debt load
5449460 there is an aging medical staff in that part of the state
5449461 that includes anyone who doesnt live here including people staying in state parks rvs camping grounds and hotels
5449462 what we tell people is you have to leave but if you stay were not responsible for you if youre injured youre on your own
5449463 fay could strengthen rapidly if it becomes well organized over water such as while passing south of cuba or over the straits of florida
5449464 on the other hand it might not strengthen much at all if land interaction prevents organization
5449465 the official track brings it off the west coast of florida tuesday and wednesday
5449466 however the track is always uncertain and the entire peninsula of florida needs to pay attention to the storm
5449467 the process continues to move forward and we have had more meetings with interested organizations
5449468 theyve made their presentations but we havent gotten into negotiations
5449469 theres a need to have leadership and the affiliation process will take a while
5449470 weve got payments that have to go strictly for these bonds and not services for the county
5449471 at this point i think we should have a debt management plan put in place
5449472 the situation its not dire but i believe we shouldnt go any further
5449473 it was very wise that we went into those capital projects when we did because construction costs were so low
5449474 some of those counties have not taken on that debt to modernize their facilities
5449475 you have to look at not just what the debt is but what it was for and how it was created
5449476 the next time they want to do a bond i will speak up and tell them the consequences for the county
5449477 i dont know what happened in the past but thats what ill do
5449478 if capital projects are benefiting the community at least people can see what their money to going to
5449479 there isnt really any one size fits all for various reasons
5449480 its really driven more by how old your infrastructure is and how available is state funding
5449481 like it or not you have to have a county government
5449482 im very optimistic that beaver county will be in good shape the next 25 years to pay off that debt
5449483 were anticipating now that it will have tropical force winds when it reaches us
5449484 conditions will begin to deteriorate late monday night into tuesday
5449485 the tampa area could get some very heavy rainfall and winds a few gusts past 74 mph isnt out of the question
5449486 we could be fine tuning these numbers as we go forward
5449487 this is an extremely bad choice for virtually all service members unless they believe they will not live long after they retire
5449488 there must be a better way for people to get money other than to assume this reduction in retirement
5449489 success i did it i won an olympic medal everybody on winning a silver medal i am completely happy and still in complete disbelief that i was able to achieve this feat im not joking its a tough loss but im on cloud nine i congratulated phelps and his coach bob bowman im just glad the race was fun to watch for everyone it was a pleasure for me really
5449490 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5449491 we regret that formal consultations have not been successful in resolving our concerns over the duties that the eu is imposing on several high tech products
5449492 we believe that these duties are inconsistent with the eus commitments on these products and that they discourage technological innovation in the it sector
5449493 is not something we can negotiate bilaterally with the united states
5449494 in effect the eu is taxing innovation a move that could impair continued technological development in the information technology industry and raise prices for millions of businesses and consumers
5449495 this aint fair yew japoneese types need to modify yer car so its slower then everybody elses they took eeer jeeerbs
5449496 looking here i see you have plenty of poundage im sure youll be fine
5449497 hi mob godfather picture there was just very little emotion shown on the stream
5449498 we unwrapped her and felt she was moving we didnt believe it at first then she began holding my mothers hand and then we saw her open her mouth
5449499 we dont know how to explain this so when we dont know how to explain things in the medical world we call it a miracle and this is probably what happened
5449500 here are 3 out of your 58 albums in rainbows by radiohead deja vu by crosby stills nash and young and atlanta by alison krauss
5449501 you have 2 albums by radiohead in rainbows and ok computer
5449502 were all in this together so theres a role for each one of us to play in being a part of the solution to these critical issues
5449503 automakers are aggressively developing and introducing new technologies but it takes 15 years or more for these technologies to become widespread on the road ecodriving helps consumers reduce carbon dioxide emissions today
5449504 for the first time development managers are going to be able to predict the quality of their software as they ship it out the door
5449505 software has become not just employee facing but also partner facing and even customer facing
5449506 there is far less room for error in such applications or in any of the applications with which they integrate
5449507 that great talent is florrie bagel im her biggest fan shes going places

5449510 speakers for your ipod can be clunky affairs they very rarely fit in your pocket and were almost certain none of them look like a building block even if theyre almost the same size that is until now the iblocks have been cleverly modelled on one of our favourite childhood building blocks you know the ones we mean and are small enough to pop in your pocket so theres no need for extra cases or wires to clutter up your bag the sound is pretty impressive for something so small the active bass system makes sure the speakers give out quite a kick all you need to do to get it working is to plug it in and we just love the volume control buttons that have been camouflaged to look like bumps and discreetly placed in the middle of the block compatible with 3rd generation ipods onwards and the ipod touch
5449511 like wills lifestyle india fashion week wifw it will be an fdci owned event with hdil as the main sponsor
5449512 the collection will have evening and bridal wear with a colour palette ranging from jewel tones to pastel hues
5449513 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
5449514 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
5449515 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
5449516 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
5449517 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
5449518 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
5449519 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
5449520 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5449521 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5449522 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5449523 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5449524 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5449525 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5449526 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5449527 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5449528 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5449529 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5449530 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5449531 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5449532 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5449533 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5449534 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5449535 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5449536 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5449537 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5449538 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5449539 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5449540 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5449541 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5449542 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5449543 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5449544 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5449545 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5449546 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5449547 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5449548 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5449549 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5449550 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5449551 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
5449552 in a bid to head off recession after the economy shrunk for the first time in six years
5449553 genuine risk was an amazing horse with tremendous heart that lived a life befitting a champion
5449554 we are truly blessed that she was a part of our life and we are deeply saddened by her passing

5449556 bruce is the best coach for the galaxy and certainly one of the best coaches in the history of the league
5449557 we have always felt that the galaxy should aspire to be the club that sets the pace and tone in major league soccer i believe bruce sees it the same way and will put us back in that position

5449584 to the extent that we have had anything to contribute we have contributed it through the council of europe and the eu
5449585 we have in other words been represented by nicolas sarkozy and while the french president has admirable qualities his interests are not identical to britains
5449586 the truth is that a common european foreign policy is already upon us britain could no more act unilaterally in georgia than in the world trade organisation
5449587 the eu has a foreign minister javier solana and an accompanying diplomatic corps known as the european external action service

5449613 if you feel you know how to get what you want out of life and you have that desire to make that happen then you have hope
5449614 what i think is exciting about hope therapy is the way we are learning from people who are doing very well we have been figuring out what hopeful people are doing right and taking those lessons and developing therapies and interventions for people who are not doing as well
5449615 the great news is that it seems to work we can teach people how to be more hopeful

5449643 like many women i work from home and my responsibilities stay there unless i leave its no vacation for me
5449644 vacations have a protective effect because they help you reduce your load of stress or at least allow you to take a break from the everyday stressors of the workplace
5449645 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5449646 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5449647 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5449648 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5449649 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5449650 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5449651 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5449652 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5449653 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5449654 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5449655 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5449656 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5449657 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5449658 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5449659 listen guys i know ok i was there and if i somehow forgot this hangover is here to remind me
5449660 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
5449661 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
5449662 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
5449663 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
5449664 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
5449665 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about

5449803 sometimes i think these political bobble heads just think way too much for their own good personally i have been wondering myself why they havent just raised the sales tax across the board in california and stop the bleeding already its a no brainer quick fix that will hit all people equally in the wallet i have lived here all 38 years of my life and i know how bad it is especially concerning our school budget cuts but instead of the proposal to raise property taxes which would only hit those who own a home an equally fair option is to raise the sales tax rates up a percent across the state its really not rocket science as much as they would like everyone to think
5449804 i have a tremendous amount of respect for how they handled that
5449805 i can tell you after talking to marian it made him feel really good the way they shared everything with him about the team and the future i thought it was a smart move on their behalf it was a very beneficial thing they did

5449807 marian has a year left on his contract with the wild and hes working hard and feeling good he says hes coming to camp in the best shape hes ever been in

5449819 we have community members who call and ask if they can come and help the vine called and asked to help lakeland baptist church wanted to give out water people just want the students to feel welcome and know they are welcome in the community as well as the university
5449820 its been a very comfortable pace plus the nice weather helps
5449821 its a great way to help the university the students want to do it you dont have to ask you tell them when and they show up
5449822 it would not be as efficient and i dont think people would feel as welcomed or know that we truly exhibit southern hospitality

5449832 those firms merrill wachovia and others are going to have to raise that cash
5449833 they are either going to have to get it from the federal reserve through some direct or indirect means which means more leverage more fed balance sheet more regularly oversight or theyre going to have to get it in the capital markets
5449834 but a thousand banks is going to be a lot

5449845 the pc a7110 full tower case is a classic representation of what lian li is all about quality the case is extremely light weight but at the same time extremely well built the sterilized design of the pc a7110 may be a turn off for some but you really can not grasp the high level of quality and workmanship in this case without spending some quality time with it pictures simply can not capture what this case is all about as for the sticker price of nearly 400 bucks there will be another large group of would be custom computer builders turned away lian li case are not for those on a budget and thats because lian li doesnt build budget cases the pc a7110 is designed and built by lian li for those who simply want elegance quality and functionality not flash or plastic as for this case being built with such incredibly high standards that all other cases should bow down before it my answer is yes ive seen a lot of cases in my time and in my opinion lian li sets the standards of quality and workmanship however not everyone who is looking for a computer case is looking for what lian li has to offer this particular case is for the serious computer enthusiast who believes quality and perfection is more important than bling

5449954 it is important for members of the senate to hear from corn growers and others about the importance of ethanol to rural communities how it is lowering prices at the pump and helping to lessen our dependence on foreign oil
5449955 the world has a growing demand for both protein and petroleum and we firmly believe that american corn producers can help satisfy both by producing energy from ethanol and protein from corn fed meat and poultry

5449975 i grew up in the suburbs of new england and bills work was very familiar territory to be sure
5449976 i grew up on a street that had kids who rode big wheels and dressed like cowboys and had air rifles like a very iconic image of bills i think his work really paved the way for those artists working in a photojournalistic way today
5449977 what he was trying to document was how these really good everyday ordinary people were incorporating or refusing to incorporate or dealing with all of the merging social values and loosening of hierarchies and social mores of the 1960s

5449981 recent history has been one of growing demand for u s commodities tight u s and world stocks of feed grains and wheat sporadic production problems and record high prices
5449982 with record large feed grain wheat and soybean crops expected for 2008 09 and some cracks forming in the demand picture prices may take on a weaker tone
5449983 in addition prices are not expected to return to the average level experienced in the period 1973 through 2006
5449984 however with the much higher level of production costs for 2009 prices below the early august lows of 4 50 for corn and 11 50 for soybeans would begin to substantially reduce operator returns particularly for those with relatively high land costs
5449985 factors thought to be important for prices have provided very mixed signals for price direction
5449986 usdas expanded survey coverage for the august report should make the acreage estimate a bit more accurate than usual
5449987 still harvested acreage reflects intentions and with more than a normal amount of late planted and re planted crops as well as unplanted areas estimates could change
5449988 on the surface the usda estimates seem to capture the effect of abandoned acreage
5449989 the august u s average yield forecast for soybeans was well below that indicated by crop condition ratings and our crop weather models perhaps reflecting the lateness of the crop
5449990 regional yield forecasts within states appear to be very consistent with weather patterns to date
5449991 in illinois both corn and soybean average yields are expected to be well above the 2007 averages in the southern two crop reporting district where drought was an issue last year
5449992 yields of both crops are expected to be sharply lower in the east crop reporting district where flooding was more widespread this spring
5449993 yield forecasts may remain high after that if some late season rain is received in the dry areas and if the crop reaches maturity without a widespread killing frost
5449994 soybean yield prospects are more difficult to anticipate particularly since the august forecast was lower than suggested by other indicators
5449995 parts of the eastern corn belt have been dry in august but much of the delta has received beneficial precipitation
5449996 the crop is more vulnerable than corn to late season disease and insect pressure and cooler weather in august may have hampered development
5449997 declining energy prices and a sharp drop in ethanol prices mean that the breakeven corn prices for ethanol producers are now much lower
5449998 prospects of large world supplies of feed wheat and a strengthening of the u s dollar suggest that u s corn exports could continue to be a little sluggish
5449999 liquidation of livestock numbers may slow but liquidation that has already occurred may slow domestic feed demand as well
